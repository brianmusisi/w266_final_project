"Avuba, Wilken Bruns Unveils Mobile-First Bank Account for Europe
","Personal banking is too complicated. That’s the reason Jonas, Wilken, and Oliver of Berlin-based Avuba are creating the bank account we always wanted! “Life is complicated and banking doesn’t need to be“, they say. One of the three, COO Wilken Bruns (photo) answered our questions about the project.
 FinSMEs: Hi Wilken. First, can you tell us a little bit more about you?
 Wilken: I’m a German born and raised in Africa. I studied Behavioural Economics and Entrepreneurship in the Netherlands, where i got hooked on startups and made my first attempts to build a scalable tech-business -> sunglasses designed by the crowd #fail. I realised I had much to learn, packed my bags and left for Berlin. I was fortunate enough to meet my mentor and former co-founder of Startupbootcamp Berlin, Alex Farcet. During the last two years we ran two programs. I learned more than I could have ever imagined from the startups we accelerated and the amazing mentors the program brought together. I’m now here at TechStars London and not sure how it happened…
 FinSMEs: Let’s speak about Avuba. how did you come up with the idea of creating it? What’s the problem do you want do fix?
 Wilken: My co-founder Jonas (CEO) had the original idea and vision and started out in early 2013 before we joined in autumn. He felt frustrated with his banking experience and so did Oliver (CPO) and I (COO). Time consuming and bureaucratic processes, bad usability, hidden fees, unfriendly service can make banking a horrid process! Banks have legacy infrastructure, slow decision making processes and the wrong culture to be able to innovate at the pace that technology is moving, especially when it comes to creating a great product for digital natives like ourselves. It seems the best they can do is the occasional facelift of their apps and online banking. We’re sick of waiting, so we’re rebuilding the structure of a bank from the ground up and creating the fastest innovating consumer retail bank in history 🙂
 FinSMEs: Tell me something more. How does it work?
 Wilken: We’re building a mobile-first bank account for Europe. It’s free to use; hassle free to sign-up; beautiful and easy to use; you can send money to your friends in under 5 seconds and you’ll always know how you’re spending your money. The idea is to build this into a platform for banking where we’re able to connect your favourite financial services for international remittence, savings accounts, mortgages, peer-to-peer lending or investments directly into your bank account. At the same time we provide our API to new financial services that want to use our banking infrastructure. Here’s a nice article on how that can look like: http://jackgavigan.com/2014/04/14/disruptive-bank/
 FinSMEs: What’s your business model?
 Wilken: At the moment we’re making money on interchange fees and interest on deposits just like banks do. The account is completely free and any European can sign up in 10 min. through their mobile phone. The idea is to get a lot of users as fast as possible. The opportunities to monetize on top of that are endless. 
 FinSMEs: some numbers?
 Wilken: Let’s just say we’re acquiring customers at a fraction of what banks are paying today.
 FinSMEs: please, introduce the other team members? Where are you based?
 Wilken: We have an incredibly talented team of 11 people in Berlin, including 6 developers. Jonas built an online marketing company in his previous life. He’s also knows how to code , which the dev team couldn’t be happier about. He actually built the first tech. Oliver has a passion for creating beautiful products and coding front-end. We he showed with his last startup Weavly, a really cool online video mashup tool. We’re now on the look out for a CTO. (have a look on their career page here).
 FinSMEs: funds…have you raised some funding so far? bootstrapped?
 Wilken: We’ve just closed a substantial angel round and already took on some convertibles for the Seed Round, which we’re opening at TechStars Demo Day on June 20.
 FinSMEs: Are you seeking vc?
 Wilken: We’re focusing on building a great product. Until now the money has found us 🙂 Ironically that’s a perk of building a bank.
 FinSMEs:…future plans?
 Wilken: Fix banking.","http://www.finsmes.com/2014/04/avuba-interview-with-wilken-bruns.html

 Christopher Oster, co-founder and CEO of the Berlin-based startup, answered our questions about innovation in the insurance industry, the product, the funding and investors and future plans.
 FinSMEs: Hi Christopher, can you tell a bit more about you? What’s your background?
 Christopher: Thank you for your interest. After I finished my PhD from WHU, I started working as a consultant for Boston Consulting Group and advised financial institutions. During that time I got the chance to co-found Wimdu and was responsible for their worldwide operations as COO.
 FinSMEs: Insurtech, a hot trend right now…does the insurance industry need a disruption wave?
 Christopher: Only 33% of young customers are happy with their insurance experience. People are used to mobile services like Facebook, Whatsapp and Mobile Banking. There is a lot of room for improving the customer experience. The insurance industry has been lagging behind a bit, compared to banking. 50% of bank accounts are accessed online, there is no reason why managing insurances online should not reach a similar level.
 FinSMEs: Let’s speak about Clark. Which need do you want to solve?
 Christopher: Most customers don’t have transparency about their insurance situation. Clark offers its customers a smartphone app which allows them to digitally manage their insurance contracts. With the assistance of an insurance-cockpit, customers learn about their ‘insurance fitness’, similar to the way fitness apps inform users of their health. Customers can improve their insurance situation with just a few clicks. Clark compares products from more than 160 insurance companies to find the best deal for each individual customer.
 FinSMEs: How does it work?
 Christopher: Our robo-advisor uses algorithms to analyze the customer’s insurance situation and automatically proposes opportunities to improve the coverage or save money. Our insurance experts are available to support our customers, especially with more complex insurance products.
 FinSMEs: Can you introduce your founding team mates in this venture?
 Christopher: Clark was founded in June 2015 and is managed by Steffen Glomb, Dr. Marco Adelt, Chris Lodde and myself. Our CTO Steffen Glomb is responsible for managing IT and Product Delivery. Previously, he held several management positions at Vodafone, Siemens, and Credit Suisse. Marco is our COO and has more than eight years of management consulting experience from Horváth & Partners. He also brings in four years of experience as an insurance broker Our CMO Chris Lodde is an experienced digital marketer and customer experience expert. Before his time at Clark, he was Vice President of Digital Sales & Banking Private Clients at Commerzbank, worked at Sun Capital Partners and was Senior Manager at SMP Strategy Consulting.
 FinSMEs: Where are you in terms of growth?
 Christopher: Our customer base is growing rapidly and already thousands of customers use our serivce.We offer tariffs from more than 160 insurers. Since the beginning of this year we have increased the volume of managed insurance premiums by a factor of fifteen to 30 million Euros.
 FinSMEs: You just raised 13.2m….How are using the funds?
 Christopher: We are going to invest the new capital in developing our technology platform and building up our team. Currently we employ nearly 20 employees, most of them in software development.
 FinSMEs: How do investors support Clark beyond capital?
 Christopher: We profit from their network and know-how.

"Scalable Capital, Interview with Ella Rabener
","In a recent post we highlighted the surge of robo-advisors in the wealth management industry. In this arena, a new player – Scalable Capital – came into the fintech limelight in April 2016 with a €7m funding round.
 Following the fundraise, Manuela (Ella) Rabener, CMO & Co-Founder UK at Scalable Capital, answered our questions about herself, robo-advising, the company, and future plans.
 FinSMEs: Hi Ella, firstly, can you tell us a bit more about you?
 Ella: I’m the CMO of Scalable Capital, an online wealth manager, and part of its UK-based founding team. I previously spent 7.5 years working with McKinsey & Company in New York, Cologne, Munich, and Dubai and then spent 3 years in Moscow as the founder & CEO of online shopping club Westwing.ru. The reason why I’m now working to build Scalable Capital is that it’s exactly the kind of service I would have wished existed during my times as a consultant: intelligent investing made convenient, transparent and low-cost. A service smart people can use that don’t have a lot of time, yet don’t want to be ripped off.
 FinSMEs: Is Robo Advising the next big think in fintech? Why?
 Ella: When you look at the major deficiency in the way the wealth management industry operates I think it’s pretty clear that robo-advising is the ‘next big thing’. Digital investment managers are able to deliver customers a better product at a better price. Additionally, the market opportunity is huge. Citi estimated that digital investment managers and robo advisers would manage $4.7 trillion in a decade’s time. It’s clearly a fast-growing segment of the market and we’re excited to be part of it.
 FinSMEs: Which is the real opportunity?
 Ella: On average, the services of most wealth managers cost more than 2.5% a year of customers’ assets. In addition, four out of five active equity funds in Europe failed to beat their benchmark over the past five years. This cross section between high fees, poor performance, and huge minimum investment criteria – on average the minimum is £800k+ – creates a massive opportunity for digital investment managers.
 While robo advisers have more attractive fees and lower minimums it’s still important to look at how they invest. Many robos offer similar investment processes based on theories going back to the 1950s and the commonly accepted idea that risk and return are correlated – more risk, more return. However there are periods of time where we experience excess volatility in the markets. During these times the typical risk-return relationship breaks down, so taking on more risk is no longer rewarded.
 This is where Scalable steps in. By taking advantage of these observations in the market, we make forward looking risk projections with the aim of catching the “early warning signals” of these periods of excess risk, so that we can dynamically adjust client portfolios and try to avoid these times of high risk and negative return. We think there’s a huge opportunity for someone to offer investors a radically different way of investing – one which uses technology at it’s core – and that is what we are doing.
 FinSMEs: Let’s speak about Scalable Capital. How does it work?
 Ella: We automate the investment process through our proprietary risk management technology. The tech is data-driven and reflects the latest insights of empirical capital markets research. Our approach is based on the fundamental principle that if the market goes up today, it’s a 50-50 chance that it goes up tomorrow. There is no correlation. Conversely, if the market moves a lot today, there’s a more than 50-50 chance that it will move a lot again tomorrow. Our product isn’t based on guessing the direction of the market – it’s based on data-driven predictions of market risk. These predictions let us scale risk exposure up or down in our clients’ portfolios to keep precisely in line with their risk appetite.
 FinSMEs: Where are you in terms of growth?
 Ella: We’re a team of 35. Our product is currently live in Germany and will be live very soon in the UK.
 FinSMEs: Scalable Capital recently raised €7m in funding. How are you using the funds?
 Ella: At the moment, we’re looking to reach more customers through marketing and looking to constantly improve our service. Our client list is growing, but we want to tell as many people as possible about how different our approach is. We’re also looking at the possibility of expanding into other markets, but that’s slightly further down the road.
 FinSMEs: future plans?
 Ella: We will be launching our UK product to clients at the beginning of June so that is our focus for the near future. We’ll continue to build our customer base as well as continuing fund raising and beyond that we hope to launch our service across all of Europe.","http://www.finsmes.com/2016/05/scalable-capital-interview-with-ella-rabener.html

 *fMR is one of the most common structural heart valve diseases and affects millions of people worldwide. Normally, the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle contracts, preventing blood from flowing backwards into the left atrium. fMR occurs when an enlarged left ventricle prevents the valve sealing completely. Patients with fMR suffer from severe symptoms, such as dyspnea and impaired exercise tolerance, and face an increased mortality risk. Until recently, many patients with severe fMR were excluded from standard surgical mitral valve treatment options due to advanced age or comorbidities.","http://www.finsmes.com/2015/09/coramaze-technologies-raises-e4-5m-series-financing.html

"N26’s Valentin Stalf, The Banking Revolutionist
","2018 has been a year full of acknowledgments for Valentin Stalf, the co-founder and CEO of Berlin, Germany based mobile bank N26. 
 On May 26th, he was honored as the Founder of the Year 2018 of the University of St.Gallen (HSG). on December 13th, recognizing his effort to redesign banking for the 21st century, Stalf was named as Young Entrepreneur of the Year from Handelsblatt and Frank Thelen.
 Born in October 4, 1985, in Vienna, Austria, Stalf studied Business Administration and obtained a Master’s degree in Accounting and Finance at University of St.Gallen.
 Before N26, he was an Entrepreneur in Residence for Rocket Internet, a global incubator and investor in online startups helping several companies grow in the mobile payments industry, including payleven and Paymill GmbH. Previously, Stalf worked in strategy consulting and investment banking.
 In 2013, he set up N26 along with Maximilian Tayenthal, Founder and CFO, a longtime friend, with whom shared the vision of building a bank that the world loved to use.
 Initially launched in 2015, N26 leverages a digital business model to operate on a much lower cost base with lean organizational structures, without IT legacies and an expensive branch network passing on these cost benefits to customers. Stalf and Tayenthal planned to offer optimized banking for smartphones, via a simple and fast customer experience. Actually, an user can open an account through the mobile phone in a few minutes, send money to friends and contacts by e-mail or SMS in real time.
 2018 was another year of exponential growth for the company. Today, N26 has more than 2 million customers across 24 countries (from less than 1m in 2017), with monthly transaction volume exceeding €1.5 billion. The company, which has a full banking license and more than 500 employees in Berlin, New York and the recently opened office in Barcelona, Spain, has raised $215m from Allianz X, Tencent Holdings Limited, Li Ka-Shing’s Horizons Ventures, Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures, members of the Zalando management board and Earlybird Venture Capital.
 According to Stalf, startups fail for no market need and – in order to avoid this – founders must think from the market side and not from the personal point of view. A hard believer in the MVP, he also thinks that “legal requirements for financial services are the benchmark in the FinTech sector“.
 Stalf’s vision of reimaging and redesigning banking for the 21st century was confirmed by his comment on the recent launch in the UK. He said: “The UK is one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world. At N26, we have re-imagined banking for the digital age and as a result we’re the fastest growing mobile bank in all European markets we operate. 
 Backed by our state-of-the-art technology stack and an intuitive, user-centric design, today’s launch is the first step towards delivering the best digital banking experience possible for UK customers.”
 Demonstrating Stalf’s focus on products, during 2018, N26 launched Spaces, a fast way to set aside money based on a customer’s personal preferences and needs, and N26 Business Black, a premium business account for freelancers and self-employed individuals.  The company also partners with innovative fintech and traditional financial companies to offer customers such products as TransferWise (foreign exchange), Raisin (savings), Clark and Allianz (insurance), auxmoney (credit) and others.
 N26 plans to enter the US market in 2019, a highly fragmented with inconsistent regulation across all 50 states. Another challenge he and his team will take on following a year of consistent growth.
 Stalf currently is also a member of the advisory board at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.","http://www.finsmes.com/2018/12/n26-valentin-stalf-the-banking-revolutionist.html

 How It Works
 Entrepreneurs can apply for a loan for € 10k/€150k, with a term of 6/60 months on www.zencap.de. The company’s risk management team then checks the company’s creditworthiness within a few days and proposes a non-binding offer based on the the risk class and the loan’s term.
 After accepting the offer, the credit project appears on the Zencap website and investors have the opportunity to select between different company profiles. An investment begins with 100€. Once a credit project is financed by investors, the credit gets paid out. Only in this case, Zencap receives an agency-fee between 1% – 4.5%, depending on the credit’s term.

"Bomedus, Interview with Tobias Weigl
","German healthcare company Bomedus has just raised 2.5m in Series B round. Founded as a spin-off of the University Clinic of Bonn, the startup aims to treat chronic pain with a holistic approach. Tobias Weigl, co-founder of Bomedus along with his brother Johannes (CEO), answered our questions about the company, the products, the funding and future plans. 
 FinSMEs: Hi Tobias, can you tell as a bit more about you?
 Tobias: I am 36 years old. I have a phd and will soon have the second one. I have two university degrees (economic and medicine).
 Besides work I am doing triathlon. My brother and I finished already more than 13 marathons (e.g. New York, Berlin, Prague). My big goal is to do the Ironman in 2016 in Roth. For this goal I am exercising around 15 to 20 hours per week. Triathlon is addiction.
 FinSMEs: Let’s speak about bomedus? What’s the problem do you want to solve?
 Tobias: We developed technology to reduce and to eliminate chronic pain, which represents a new way to stimulate small fibers that are responsible for “transporting” the pain from the origin (e.g. knee pain, back pain) to the central nerve system, in particular the brain. Our small fiber matrix stimulation (R) is stimulating specifically those small fibers, in particular the so-called Adelta and C-fibers (those are relevant for “transporting” the pain).
 We enable patients to have again a normal sensitivity for pain. Chronic pain patients become more and more sensitive for pain. A so-called “pain memory” is the result. Our technology eradicates this pathological “pain memory”.
 FinSMEs: Have you found a huge market?
 Tobias: Yes, nearly 15% of all people worldwide have chronic pain and all those people are potential customers for us. Of course there are small differences in scale and type of chronic pain in different countries but overall people in all countries suffer under the same problem: “Pain memory” by chronic pain. And that’s the problem we solve.
 FinSMEs: Which stage are you right now?
 Tobias: We are now producing and selling products. We have our own patents and we are certified for producing and selling medical products. Of course, we also work together with a handful of suppliers. We have only some suppliers because we have very high quality standards and guidelines.
 FinSMEs: Where is the company today in terms of growth?
 Tobias: We have currently 10 employees and around 850 customers/ patients who use or have used our technology. We have currently three major products: our bomedus Rückenband lumbal for the lower back pain, our bomedus Rückenband thorakal for the upper back pain and our bomedus Stumpfband for amputation pain.
 We work together with around 100 doctors and clinics in Germany. We are having our first customers in Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland. Our goal is to expand more into those countries and to enter further countries in the European Union.
 FinSMEs: You just raised funding. How are you using the funds? Are investors supportive beyond capital?
 Tobias: Yes, they are. As said above:
 1. expand throughout Europe
 2. develop Further products for more indications
 3. develop products against cancer pain
 4. continue R&D.
 FinSMEs: bomedus is a spin-off of the University Clinic of Bonn. Can you tell us about your academia/industry experience? Is it a good practise? Can tech transfer work in Europe?
 Tobias: Yes, it can work but it is very difficult. The majority of people either have tech or business expertise. Luckily, my brother (Dr. Johannes Weigl) and I combine both. I think this is critical for success.","http://www.finsmes.com/2015/11/bomedus-interview-with-tobias-weigl.html

 In a second step image analysis results are fed into the reporting software, which guides the radiologist using a step-by-step approach through the entire report.","http://www.finsmes.com/2017/11/smart-reporting-receives-eu-funding.html

"European Fund Boundary Holding Announces Funding in German AI Startup KONUX
","Global investment fund Boundary Holding recently announced its investment in KONUX, an Industrial IoT and AI analytics company based in Munich, Germany.
 Co-Founded by Andreas Kunze (CEO), Dennis Humhal (COO), and Vlad Lata (Vice-Chairman), KONUX combines smart sensors and AI-based analytics to enable higher train punctuality and network capacity through predictive maintenance planning and an optimized utilization of railroads.
 Recently KONUX was named one of the most innovative scale-ups worldwide by the World Economic Forum. The organization has also secured investments from New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Alibaba Group, Upbeat Ventures, MIG AG, and Andy Bechtolsheim. It raised €11.5 million as an extension of its Series B round, bringing the total amount raised in the round since last year to €29 million, and the total raised to date by the startup to €44 million.
 The (undisclosed) investment by Boundary Holding is part of this Series B1 round, facilitating funds for the organization and giving it exposure across different international markets – which considering Boundary Holding’s international presence would prove to be helpful for KONUX’s international expansion in railway analytics and optimization.
 Final terms of the investment were followed by a close-set meeting wherein, Rajat Khare, the founder of Boundary Holding and Andreas Kunze met in London and Zurich to discuss terms, investment scope and the potential of partnership. The synergy between the founders, their thoughts and expectations set the stage for the investment.

It is also in accord with a global investment trend in Industrial IoT, wherein several organizations are betting on IoT to revamp conventional industries and markets.","http://www.finsmes.com/2019/04/european-fund-boundary-holding-announces-funding-in-german-ai-startup-konux.html

"The Importance of a UK and Germany Post-Brexit Trade Deal
","Brexit negotiations are in full swing, yet there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the future, not just for the UK but for many of the countries it does regular trade with. Germany is the UK’s second largest trading partner after the USA, accounting for 10.7% of UK exports in 2016 at a value of $43.6 billion. For this reason, after Brexit it is vital for both nations, businesses and SMEs that a good trade deal is put in place.
 Current Negotiations
 As probably the most powerful nation in the EU, Germany is taking quite a hard-line stance in the UK’s Brexit negotiations. In one of the latest round of negotiations they demanded that the UK pay for its financial firms to have access to EU markets and is against any kind of bespoke deal that the UK may be trying to carve out.
 In many ways Germany’s position poses a big risk to the UK’s aim to get a more tailor-made exit route. The only way it will step aside is if the UK drops opposition to substantial budget payments. If this leads to frosty relations developing between the two nations, then agreeing a further trade deal post-Brexit could prove difficult and detrimental to both sides.
 Job Risks
 Already there are plenty of warning that many jobs in the UK could be at risk after Brexit, especially in the financial sector with a lot of large companies expected to move out of London. Yet there are also risks to the German job market, such as in the auto industry. One report claims that 14,000 jobs at car suppliers in Germany could be lost, for example. Germany and the UK rely on each other in a lot of sectors, so hashing out a trade deal will be in both of their best interests to reduce the chance of job losses.
 Logistical Impacts
 A key part of trade involves the logistics of arranging deliveries to and from both countries. Fresh barriers after Brexit and that new trade deals could impose may make it a lot more difficult and more expensive for businesses from SMEs to large corporations to send goods overseas.
 To deliver a parcel to Germany at the moment is fairly simple. TNT offer services from economy to time definite that can suit all sorts of businesses. After Brexit the costs of sending a parcel to Germany could increase, with additional custom duties, though hopefully logistics companies will be prepared to deal with these.","http://www.finsmes.com/2018/02/the-importance-of-a-uk-and-germany-post-brexit-trade-deal.html

","A Polish who studied and worked in Germany (and in the UK), a multilanguage speaker, a tech lover, a blogger, Pawel Chudzinski of Point Nine Capital is one of the most active startup investors on the Berlin scene. He accepted to answer my questions.
 FinSMEs: Who are you? What’s your background?
 Pawel: I come from Poland and I went to Germany when I was 17. I studied here in Germany. After I started working for a bank, then Frankfurt, London, which I left in 2009. I’ve always loved technology and during my studies and my professional life I had the opportunity to meet with people linked to the startup envirnments.
  In 2009, I had the opportunity to transform my passions into a work co-founding Team Europe.
  In 2011, I co-founded Point Nine Capital along with Cristoph Janz.
 FinSMEs: What’s Point Nine Capital? Which is the investment strategy?
 Pawel: Point Nine Capitat is an early stage investment fund based in Berlin. We invest a few hundred thousands euros in any company. We are very interested in startups working on online software, software as a services, marketplaces, financial services, etc.
 FinSMEs: Was it hard to raise the latest fund in this particular time for Europe? The crisis, you know…
 Pawel: It took some times, and of course it did’t happen overnight, it was challenging but we got it.
 FinSMEs: Was it harder than raising the first fund?
 Pawel: Yes, it was different because this latest fund is much bigger. The first fund was €6m. This one amounts to €40m. Some investors are the same, but there are many new investors.
 FinSMEs: Which is your personal approach with founders? What do you want to see in them? What don’t you want to see?
 Pawel: Very hard to say. They can be young or old, we don’t care. We work with people with no or a lot of experience but 100% committed, who really want to do something meaningful to build a great company. We tipically work with teams so it is very rare we invest in one single person. We also like distributed teams, people who work from home. We are very flexible on that. We want to see guys who are very good on what they do, ready to focus on something for many years.
 FinSMEs: What do you think about startup failure?
 Pawel: The majority of startups fail. It’s part of the game somehow. It’s not nice but it’s like learning for everyone.
 FinSMEs: Berlin is taking the lead as a community to grow startups in Europe…In your opinion, which are the reasons behind it?
 Pawel: Berlin is a big city, it is the capital of the biggest economy in Europe. It has a long time of tradition of creativity. It is the right place for creative people, not for standard people. It has been attractive for this kind of people for a long time, artists, designers, a lot of crazy guys. It’s also very cheap and nice to live, attractive for lots of clubs and museums, and over the last five/ten years it has been increasingly attractive for entrepreneurs and startup founders. It’s been going for many years but in the last three years we can see it has reached the critical mass and it is becoming to work as a cluster. The availability of capital helped this process.
 FinSMEs: Capital or people. What matter most?
 Pawel: There’s need of both but people are more important!

"FinLeap, Interview with Managing Director Ramin Niroumand
","Berlin, Germany-based FinLeap is a company builder specialized in the financial services industry. Considered their thematic approach and particular way to operate, we decided to interview Managing Director Ramin Niroumand, who answered our questions about the firm and activities (programs and portfolio) and shared with us some thoughts about the financial industry, how to fix it, the fintech and insurtech arenas and their perspectives. 
 FinSMEs: Ramin, nice to meet you…can you tell us a bit more about you? what’s your background?
 Ramin: I am Co-Founder, Managing Director and Partner at FinLeap. I have been the first team member and I am now in charge of strategic management and business model development. Before FinLeap I have worked in consulting for more than 20 international banks. As Innovation Manager at DKB Deutsche Kreditbank AG I led their electronic and mobile payment innovation projects alongside PayPal, Sofortüberweisung and Cringle.
 FinSMEs: Is the financial industry completely broken?
 Ramin: Currently we see a deep structural change in the financial industry. It is triggered by digitization. Customers want easy and mobile financial services – Paypal or Savedo are good examples for this trend. New players like Apple and Alibaba enter the market. Laws are reconsidered or even overruled – as in the insurance sector in Germany. Does it mean, the finance industry is broken? I see it more like adding spice to a blend meal. Fintechs add new value, revive an industry that has been settled for a long time. I am convinced the new mix of players will create new chances for new players but also for banks through cooperation with innovative and dynamic new actors such as Finleap.
 FinSMEs: What does Finleap do? How does it work?
 Ramin: FinLeap is a company builder specialized in the financial services industry. We are based in Berlin. Our objective is to support startups in establishing sustainable, customer-centric and technology-driven businesses. FinLeap provides entrepreneurs with 0.5 to 5 million euros in seed funding and access to a strong network of investors. So founder benefit from access to top talent, an integrated development platform, best practice processes and extensive expertise in the financial services sector. In the last year Fintech ventures like Savedo, Valendo, BillFront and Clark were launched with the help of FinLeap.
 FinSMEs: What’s Finleap’s Talent Network?
  Ramin: As a company builder we need fresh talent constantly. It is important to find the right cofounders who want to grow great Fintech companies with us. That’s one reason why we decided to start FinLeap in Berlin. The eco-system in Berlin is unique. Highly educated tech-experts, experienced founders, an international community of tech-savvy people and various venture capital firms define the city. At the same time, Berlin is attractive for financial experts due to its high-quality life standards. People want to live in Berlin – and work here. However, selecting the right people out of the more than 1,000 applications we receive every month is definitely a challenge. Fortunately, we have an experienced recruiting team that take lots of time to talk to interested cofounders and employees.
 FinSMEs: Can you introduce the startups in the portfolio?
  Ramin: In less than a year we have launched six ventures already.
  The first FinLeap venture was Savedo, an European online marketplace for retail investment products. The platform offers investors the opportunity to deposit their savings safely, and at attractive interest rates, across the European Union.
  BillFront was launched in February 2015 and is an online platform that offers a working capital solution to app developers, app publishers and ad networks.
  In March Valendo, an online provider for fast and reliable high-value asset-based lending, joined the FinLeap family.
  With financeAds International GmbH we also have an international affiliate network with a focus on the financial sector in the portfolio.
  In June 2015 Clark was founded as an insurance platform demanding transparent, cheap and comprehensive insurance coverage.
  Another startup is FinReach which develops digital solutions for financial services, unifying industry knowledge with technical know-how and product-centric thinking. They offer technical solutions to deliver a stronger origination process for banks, and have developed the first automated current account switch kit. The products are offered on performance-based terms as white-label solutions to clients from the financial service industry.
  Currently we are working on three other companies.
 FinSMEs: Which fintech trend do you follow with particular interest?
  Ramin: The distribution power of the internet made it possible that many different financial services can be provided by many different, small digital companies – unbundling financial services. This has been a trend for a while. Rebundling of unbundled services is definitely a trend that I am most interested in.
 FinSMEs: Do you personally believe in the power of Bitcoin and the underlying technology?
  Ramin: I personally do not believe in Bitcoin, but I believe in the power of the underlying technology.
 FinSMEs: Where do you see the banking and insurance industries in the next ten years?
  Ramin: 100% digital and mobile.","http://www.finsmes.com/2015/12/finleap-interview-with-managing-director-ramin-niroumand.html

"Tame, Interview with Co-Founder Torsten Müller
","I came across Tazaldoo some days ago. In April, the had raised €250k in equity crowdfunding via Companisto (read here) to develop Tame, a personalized context search engine for the microblogging service Twitter. Being always curious about tools for journalists and bloggers, I contacted Torsten Müller, Co-founder & CCO, of the Berlin-based startup. He accepted to answer my questions.
 FinSMEs: Hello Torsten, Can you tell me a little bit more about you?
 Torsten: Buongiorno Ermanno! In the last five years I studied and lived in four different countries, went from being a PR to working as a journalist for the German news agency dpa and other outlets. During my postgraduate studies in media & globalisation met my co-founder Frederik, with whom I launched a global freelance journalism network before creating Tame.
 FinSMEs: Let’s speak about Tame. What is it?
 Torsten: Tame is our solution to fight the information overload on the real-time web. In this case, we started out with Twitter, as it’s the most relevant platform for news. We call Tame a “context search engine”, as it delivers the most relevant topics, people and links for your search at a glance. Tame is a web-based application that works in your browser and on mobile devices, too. 
 FinSMEs: How does it work?
 Torsten: Tame delivers at a glance the most relevant topics, people and links from Twitter. By breaking down the chronological streams into relevance rankings, we help people discover relevant information more quickly. You can get a digest from your own timeline or search the whole of Twitter for anything you like. One example: I follow about 800 people on Twitter, which results in more than 3000 tweets in my timeline per day. Tame tells me what the people I follow are talking about, who they are talking about and what articles, videos or images are interesting for them. The individual timeline is however only one dimension we cover with Tame. The other is global Twitter search: There can be easily a hundreds of thousands of tweets for one hashtag, for example #boston a few ago. Tame crunches this big data down into the three top ten rankings of most relevant people, topics and links.
 FinSMEs: What’s your business model?
 Torsten: Tame is currently in open beta and free to use. Soon we are going to make revenue based on subscriptions with a freemium model: the timeline analysis remains free, while global search and additional features start at 5 Euros per month. We also offer customized data analysis based on Tame for B2B clients on individual rates.
 FinSMEs: The company: Tazaldoo. Who are your team members?
 Torsten: We are a mixed team of journalists and developers. I want to highlight our CTO Arno, who converts our concepts into code. He’s an experienced Ruby developer who already has an entrepreneurial background. Frederik is a journalist with lots of experience and a bigger vision, who decided that the trade needs innovation coming from inside. There is Matthias, who has a PhD in computer science and manages our frontend development, while Tobias is now in charge of Social Media Marketing and SEO. And not to forget Sarah, our new assistant, who keeps the organisational chaos that 5 men produce in check.
 FinSMEs: You raised €250k via companisto.de. What a win. What can you tell me about that experience? 
 Torsten: Our campaign with Companisto went outstandingly well: 808 micro investors invested in us. We were overwhelmed by the positive feedback and the fact that we raised the maximum amount in such a short period of time (less than four weeks). It is good to see that the people realize the problem and have confidence in the solution we are building. A lot of credit goes to the guys from Companisto: apart from running the platform, they consulted us how to prepare and run the campaign and have managed to gather an exceptional investor crowd.
 FinSMEs: Are you still seeking funds?
 Torsten: In order to grow and scale our business further, we are looking for growth investments early next year.
 FinSMEs: How are you using the funds?
 Torsten: We use a major part for development and staff. We have extended the team to take some bureaucratic and administrative weight off the founders’ shoulders, so that we are able to concentrate on our core objectives in sales, marketing, product design and development.
 FinSMEs:…future plans?
 Torsten: We’re working very hard these days on a redesign of Tame, with a more beautiful and intuitive user interface plus the introduction of the subscription model. In October, the founders will stay for three months or longer in the Silicon Valley as part of the German Silicon Valley Accelerator, which selected us for their program. We’re looking very much looking forward to presenting Tame to the US market, the homeland of Twitter.

"Frankfurt Listed Fintech Company NAGA Group Launches Token Sale
","The NAGA Group AG, a German FinTech company listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (ISIN: DE000A161NR7), has just announced its Token Sale event.
 With the Token Sale, the company is to launch the NAGA Coin (NGC) with the aim to create a Blockchain-powered ecosystem for decentralized trading, investing and education in financial markets, virtual goods and cryptocurrencies.
 Basically, NAGA wants to change the standards for all future token sales out there. With the number of token sales set to go over a thousand, NAGA wants to show the market that it is time to introduce something more transparent and secure. The fact that the Company IPO’d this summer gives all other ambitious projects a good example to follow. In fact, NAGA will be the first company to follow up a successful IPO with an ICO, all within the space of less than 6 months. Moreover, only 16% of all existing ICOs have an MVP or an existing product or platform. Thus, NAGA’s ecosystem will be based on SwipeStox, an existing iOS and Android app and online trading platform and social network for traders. In operation since early 2015, the SwipeStox trading platform is utilized by hundreds of thousands of registered users and today facilitates over 200 thsd. transactions each month with more than four billion USD transacted.
 SwipeStox, which also offers open interfaces for other third-party brokers, is directly connected to NAGA Markets Ltd., a Cyprus based, CySEC-regulated brokerage firm and asset management firm within the group (former Hanseatic Brokerhouse Global Markets Ltd.) specializing in Forex and CFD trading.
 NAGA’s second venture, called Switex, enables users to connect the financial trading world with the gaming world, by enabling them to trade in-game merchandise. Currently under development, Switex will be launched in beta mode in the first quarter of 2018.
 Finally, NAGA will also launch a wallet that will unite both of those platforms. The tokens will be stored in the NAGA Wallet in order to enable people to use them for SwipeStox, Switex and other future platforms, such as the NAGA Trading Academy, as well as to convert blockchain assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), etc. NAGA also plans to introduce a debit card, allowing users to spend their cryptocurrencies in millions of online and offline locations worldwide.
 Within the NAGA ecosystem, social media features (chats, channels, video and add server, follow and watch functions) are already prominent alongside a more traditional trading approach. Just like in Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook, users can produce and share daily contributions free of charge.
 Given all of the above, the new ecosystem will give everyone the ability to become a trader, with no need to cooperate with banks or brokers. Users will be able to trade stocks and forex with their NGC tokens, and (later) with no commissions involved. The token sale will allow users to tie their token to the NAGA stock. Given the significance that NGC weill play in the future NAGA ecosystem, the stock price is sure to increase along with the augmentation of the token price.
 In addition, as the world´s first publicly listed company to move forward with an ICO, NAGA is going to initiate the Token Sale with a current capitalization of over 300 million USD and a fully functioning existing product (SwipeStox) just waiting to capitalise further on the tokens that will be created. Thus, this solid foundation gives users the chance to enjoy a more secure and attracting framework to participate in than those carried out by other companies in this field. This secure environment is further guaranteed by the company’s solidity given its numerous offices across major European countries, including Germany (2 offices in Hamburg), Spain (offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Palma de Mallorca), and Cyprus (Limassol), as well as by more than 20,000 paying clients from over 100 countries. Not to mention the fact that NAGA’s share price has experienced a 500% rise in value since the IPO in June from €2.60 to currently €14.00.

"OpenTabs, Interview with Dirk Röder
","OpenTabs, a Munich, Germany-based mobile startup, has just closed a funding round with High-Tech Gründerfonds (read here).  Dirk Röder answered our questions about the company, the platform and future plans.
 FinSMEs: Hi Dirk. First, can you tell us a little bit more about you? What’s your background?
 Dirk: After university a friend and myself founded a company providing IR / PR information from stocks with a secondary listing in Germany. The aftermath of 9/11 lead us to the decision to close down operations and use the companies asset for investment purposes only. In 2002 Audi hired me for B2E tasks for their new intranet team. As part of a sort of consulting branch I had the chance to work on different projects until I finally worked in international marketing, including a year abroad in Los Angeles. After over seven years I left Audi for a job at an agency on the client BMW, basically getting the brand back into branded entertainment.
 FinSMEs: Let’s speak about OpenTabs. What’s the problems you want to solve and the opportunity you found in the market?
 Dirk: The initial idea was based on experience everyone has gathered in life. One waits to place another order for wine, coke etc and unfortunately the waitress doesn’t pay attention. Well and then one waits again to pay the bill. That’s how we started. But soon we found out, that table service is a little to science fiction in January 2012, so we broadened the features in our app and it still works that way:
  a) as a guest you can scan a QR Code and order from a table
  b) as a walk-in you are able to order while on the go and skip the line at the register
  c) as part of the audience in a stadium you are able to place an order by leaving your exact seating position
 The hospitality industry lacks everything from web 2.0. A restaurant owner has no way of knowing who enters his establishment, nor does he is able to reach out for him directly. Our journey once started with the feature ordering and only one year later we added the payment feature. By the end of this year we will have finalized and launched the next two major steps for those owners out there, who would like to know who likes my place, what’s there favorite meal and how can I reach out for a very specific group of customers without scattering loss.
 In a nut shell: We offer a better, faster service for the customer and provide comprehensive data and more revenue for the merchant.
 FinSMEs: How does OpenTabs work? Tell me something about the features of the service
 Dirk: The system consists of three parts. The app for the customer, enabling him to see the menu, order and pay for his wishes. Secondly the backbone, our servers. All the power is built in here. That’s where all the strings come together. Last but not least the merchant side. Here we offer a standalone feature (a regular printer with internet connection) or an open API for any POS system to hook up with.
 FinSMEs: Where are you now in terms of growth? Some numbers?
 Dirk: Three founders by 2012 and we have hired 6 people until today – interns and such not included. At this very moment we make revenue but it’s a longterm business plan. With all the mayor international chains like Mc Donald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, Starbucks, Chipotle etc lining up there own order & pay app solutions, we are very excited to read, that square recently announced there aggregator „pick-up“. Apparently we had the right idea in 2012!
 FinSMEs: You just raised a round of funding. What can you tell me about the investors? How are you using the funds?
 Dirk: We are looking for developers and sales staff. Basically our goal is to successfully conquer Munich/ south Germany and do a roll-out to Germany and the EU.
 FinSMEs:…future plans?
 Dirk: As stated above. We are looking into a serious funding round for the roll-out, providing the best hospitality solution in Europe.
 FinSMEs: Finally, what about Munich as a startup ecosystem? Is it growing? Exciting?
 Dirk: The German market is tough, especially with people using cash more than any other country. But on the other hand people see the disadvantages coming along with cash as well. That is why we needed a good argument to convince people to use opentabs: we reduce their waiting time, especially in the morning on their way to work or during lunch hours. „Do you wanna line up or go straight to pick-up?“.","http://www.finsmes.com/2014/09/opentabs-interview-with-dirk-roder.html

"SAP.iO No Boundaries to Back Women and Minorities Led Startups
","Enterprise application software company SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) has launched SAP.iO No Boundaries, an initiative to offer venture capital and incubation to women and minorities led startups. 
 SAP pledges to commit up to 40 % of the investable capital in its SAP.iO Fund and scale its SAP.iO Foundries program with focus on inclusive entrepreneurship. The goal is to support at least 200 startups around the world within the next five years.
 Launched in March 2017 as a $35m fund, The SAP.iO Fund has invested directly in more than 15 startups to date. SAP.iO Foundries, a zero-equity acceleration program with a special focus on inclusive entrepreneurship, has accelerated nearly 100 early-stage software startups, more than 30 % of which are founded or led by women or other minority entrepreneurs.
 SAP has recognized the need for improvement in an industry where, in 2017, only 2.2 % of venture capital went to women-only founded startups, according to data from PitchBook Data Inc. In that year, it also found that less than 13 % of venture capital went to U.S. startups having at least one female founder.
 Women do not fare well in Europe either, with only 2 % of venture capital going to women-only funded startups and only 7 % of venture capital going to startups with at least one female founder, according to data from Atomico Investment Holdings Limited. Black and Latinx entrepreneurs in the United States face similar and often even greater challenges. Given the above, SAP sees a significant business opportunity in supporting these entrepreneurs, who face major barriers when raising capital despite showing strong performance and long-term viability.
 SAP.iO No Boundaries aims to further embed inclusion in SAP’s culture, in the cultures of our customers and in the startups with which SAP engages. Open to startups globally, the initiative provides chosen startups with access to curated mentorship, exposure to SAP® technology, support for integration with SAP applications as well as opportunities to meet and collaborate with SAP customers.","http://www.finsmes.com/2019/01/sap-io-no-boundaries-to-back-women-and-minorities-led-startups.html

","Today, the majority of us use messaging apps for any reason, from staying in touch with the people around us, to sharing thoughts and images and exchanging documents and often think they do not satisfy a minimum level of security. 
 This can be considered true for the most popular communication networks for instant data exchange, such as GSM, Skype, WeChat, Slack, Google Talk, Facebook, etc., which do not provide an adequate level of protection and privacy.
 Think about an average person who is annoyed of the lack of security in the above contemporary popular social networks, a wealthy businessman who wants to communicate safely with his children who are currently studying abroad, a middle-class business owner who works to create complex technical products for specialized B2B purposes, a government official responsible for the management of highly sensitive data, a CEO at a large corporation, In all these cases, people want chats and discussions are being encrypted.
 To solve these issues, a new German startup, called Crypviser, has pioneered a professionally-designed, encrypted network for social and business communication that meets the highest standards of cryptography and enables people to discuss private information, without a fear it can be decrypted or found out.
 By leveraging patent-pending algorithms of true encryption keys authentication, based on blockchain technology, which help protect against identity theft and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, the Crypviser network provides all the needed features and capabilities for social and business communication, such as secure instant messaging (chat), audio and video calls, photo/video and file sharing, group calls (voice conferences), etc., which up until now have only been available to the largest corporations, financial institutions, government agencies and secret services.
 In addition, an independent encrypted local storage on the user’s device allows to securely store all kinds of sensitive data and protect them from data loss due to physical damage or malicious software.
 Finally, an integrated crypto wallet in the app allows to safely keep, manage and transfer amounts through CVPay, which is a secure, anonymous and fast money transfer system.
 In order to continue to develop and launch the product, Crypviser is now running its ICO which will close on June, 30, 2017.

 – to start the alpha-testing phase of B2C Crypviser app for Android and iOS platforms and prepare the network infratructure in July,

"Bitcoin’s Roger Ver and Mate Tokay Join NAGA Board of Advisors
","
 The NAGA Group AG welcome Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver and COO Mate Tokay to the NAGA board of advisors.
 ————————————————————————————————————————–
 German FinTech company The Naga Group AG announced today that Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver had joined NAGA’s board of advisors. Furthermore, Ver’s colleague and Bitcoin.com COO Mate Tokay has joined the project as an advisor as well. Both men are well respected and considered to be key influencers within the cryptocurrency community and will bring a wealth of experience and insight to NAGA.
 NAGA’s ideas get pretty close to Roger’s philosophy and ideology. Due to the fact that NAGA’s Ecosystem will give access to 2 billion underbanked users to participate in the financial and crypto markets, it will allow everyone to get into trading and investing and it will result in their potential independent individual lifestyle, which supports the idea of libertarianism that is embraced by Roger.
 Due to the fact that Roger supports Bitcoin Cash, the NAGA Group decided to add BCH to their accepted currencies on their Token Sale in order to reduce the barriers for their potential investors and future customers who would like to become a part of the ecosystem.
 Founders and Executive Directors of The NAGA Group AG, Benjamin Bilski and Yasin Sebastian Qureshi expressed their keen pleasure with this latest development:
 “We are proud that Roger and Mate joined our Token sale. Both have an impressive track record in the industry and they have left an already significant footprint in the crypto-community. Roger and Mate´s engagement also substantiate our ambition to create a powerful solution for barrier-free investing into stocks or virtual goods with our NAGA Coin. Having one of the most renowned people from the community, combined with our fast growing business powered by our exchange-listed company, makes us confident to set the path for a fundamental token growth”.
 Roger Ver
 Take a look at any Who’s Who in Bitcoin list and you’ll find Roger Ver near the top of that list. Dubbed ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, Ver is a pioneer for Bitcoin adoption around the world. In 2011, Ver’s company, MemoryDealers.com, became the first mainstream company to accept Bitcoin as a payment option. He is considered to be the first Bitcoin angel investor, having funded the seed rounds for most of the entire first generation of Bitcoin-related businesses, including:
 – The Bitcoin Foundation
 – Bitpay
 – Blockchain.info
 – Ripple
 – Kraken
 Ver is a proponent of libertarianism and voluntaryism, believing in an individual’s right to freedom of choice, voluntary association, and self-governance. These beliefs are in harmony with NAGA’s mission, which is to open up the financial and crypto markets to the more than 2 billion underbanked people in the world, offering them the potential for a wealthier individual lifestyle.
 Speaking about NAGA, Ver stated: “I’m honored to be involved as an advisor to a company that shares my same ideals.”
 Mate Tokay
 ‘Bitcoin Disciple’ to Ver’s ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, Mate Tokay is without question one of Bitcoin’s most active and vocal proponents. A professional athlete and former wakeboard world champion, Tokay made his first foray into the crypto space when he began mining Bitcoin in 2013 using custom-built ASIC miners. Since then he has gone on to spread the word about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at conferences and speaking engagements around the world.
 In keeping with his desire to educate people about Bitcoin, Tokay founded the crypto media news website Bitcoinist in 2013. Since then, he has continued to keep his finger on the pulse of the cryptocurrency industry and has been involved in several successful blockchain-related projects.
 Tokay’s role within the Bitcoin community has been described as “[focusing] on a larger vision and communicating that vision to others while staying on top of trends in the industry. His goal and passion is to make cryptocurrencies as popular as possible.”
 Mate Tokay claimed: “I am thrilled to join the NAGA Token Sale as an advisor; they already have a working product that will allow millions of unbanked people to trade on the crypto markets and with that giving them the opportunity to reach financial freedom.”
 NAGA Token Sale
 In the wake of Roger Ver’s appointment to NAGA’s board of advisors and in light of his support of Bitcoin Cash, The NAGA Group has decided to add Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to the list of accepted cryptocurrencies for its upcoming token sale.
 NAGA-Founder Benjamin Bilski explained:
 “We consider BCH to represent the future of cryptocurrencies, because of its small transaction cost and other benefits. Thus, we believe that it will reduce the barriers for our potential investors and future customers to become a part of our ecosystem.”
 NAGA will be launching its token sale in two stages – the Pre-Token Sale and the main Token Sale. The exchange rate for NAGA Coin is 1 NGC = $1 USD. Investors can purchase tokens using BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, and DASH. For those wishing to use FIAT currency, EUR and USD are also accepted.

 Gidsy is now a part of GetYourGuide
 Just over a year ago, we set out to change the way people travel and explore the world. The idea was sparked from a failed mushroom hunt – we couldn’t find a local expert to help us pick wild mushrooms for a risotto – and grew from there. Together with a Community of local guides and experts, passionate explorers, makers, foodies, pilots and more, Gidsy quickly expanded from Berlin to over 140 cities across the world.
 Together with you, we brought Gidsy to every corner of the globe, started a Food Revolution, DIY’d over Maker Weekends, got together for Meetups and most importantly, had fun. We were constantly inspired and humbled by the wonderful stories we heard, and the people we met and were lucky to work with through Gidsy. Above all else, we must extend a heartfelt thank you to the amazing Gidsy Community, for everything.
 We’re thrilled to be joining forces with GetYourGuide to help connect travelers with unique experiences worldwide. GetYourGuide is the world’s leading platform for tours, attractions and activities, with over 19000 things to do all over the globe. We’ve known the awesome GetYourGuide team for some time now, and share a common vision, which is why we couldn’t be happier with this next big step.
 Our goals haven’t changed; we want to help anyone, anywhere to organize and find unique things to do. We want to foster connections between curious travelers and passionate locals. We believe the best things in life aren’t things, and we want to help change the way we all travel and experience the world.
 We’re very excited to get started on this next adventure, and hope you’ll come along.

"Dating App Hicky Uses Blockchain to Increase Security; Launches Token Sale
","The old fashioned dating industry was one of the first sectors to be disrupted by technology with interaction shifted online already in the first phase following the growth and establishment of the Internet. 
 Some platforms and killer applications soon thrived given their easy-to-use interface and improved user experience.
 Some evidences? Think about Meetic, the French online dating service founded in November 2001 which became publicly quoted in October 2005. Beyond Meetic, Tinder, Badoo, Happn, just to name a few of them, have brought the dating process online and mobile.
 THE PROBLEM
 Nevertheless, a lot of people are afraid of using online and mobile dating services because of such issues as lack of privacy and relationship unfairness (inherent to centralized systems). But dating is an intimate experience and developers have been working to solve these issues ensuring users benefits of using an app can overcome the risk perceptions with uneven progress made, anyways.
 While a centralized platform requires as much information as possible in order to optimize the matching process of participants with more data points leading to higher probabilities of generating qualified matches, users also expose more information based on the trust that they will get better results.
 Furthermore, spam issues (zero cost for messaging) and bots/fake profiles (identity verification) are deeply intrinsic in legacy dating apps.
 THE SOLUTION
 Given all this, blockchain technology can help make dating more secure and effective. This is why a transparent and decentralized dating app, called Hicky, has been launched.
 Hicky leverages the blockchain to create a network with an underlying token economy, incentivizing individual user and community good behavior.
 The privacy of user information is secure through the use of a decentralized database (initially BigChainDB and in the future Swarm Protocol) where all data is secured through encryption. For messaging, a decentralised approach will be taken by using the Whisper Protocol. Messages will be private and users will pay microtransactions for the interactions, thus limiting spam.
 Verification will work through two factors building a biometric identification process combining both voice and face scan as well as matching. This effectively prevents the use of bots while simultaneously creating a network of trusted participants.

"The NAGA Group Brings New Standards to the ICO Sphere
","It is known that the cryptofinance and ICO worlds combine both promise and danger. Skepticism is high among experts who warn that the lack of transparency around the issuance of such tokens is a concern for both investors and regulators.
 Given the above, publicly listed, EU-regulated fintech company The NAGA Group is trying to bring respect and new standards to this often opaque ecosystem. Listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (ISIN: DE000A161NR7) since July 2017, the German company, which has a market cap of more than €200m, millions in reported revenues, over $4 billion in trading volume every month, and a team of more than 120 people, has just announced its Token Sale event.
 This shows the market that this is the right time to introduce a more transparent and secure approach for all future token sales out there, and it also gives other IPO’d companies a good example to follow. Additionally, the fact that The NAGA Group is backed by large investors, such as Chinese fund Fosun and German private bank Hauck & Aufhäuser, makes it clear that established companies can focus on attracting big funds, which then enables them to leverage big whales’ community leadership to make their tokens more appealing. To this end, NAGA recently added Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver and Bitcoin.com COO Mate Tokay to its board of advisors. As key influencers within the cryptocurrency community, these additions aim to bring a wealth of experience and insight to NAGA.
 Through the ICO, the company wants to expand its ecosystem including:
 – SwipeStox, an existing iOS and Android app and online trading platform and social network utilized by hundreds of thousands of registered traders and active since 2015.
 – Switex, a legal virtual goods exchange platform which will allow video game players to buy in-game virtual items from other gamers as well as from the game publishers themselves. Currently under development, it will be launched in beta in the first quarter of 2018.
 In addition, NAGA is advancing a wallet for people to store tokens and use them for SwipeStox, Switex and other future platforms, such as the NAGA Trading Academy, as well as to convert blockchain assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), etc., as well as a debit card, which will allow users to spend their cryptocurrencies in online and offline locations worldwide.","http://www.finsmes.com/2017/11/the-naga-group-brings-new-standards-to-the-ico-sphere.html

"baimos technologies, Interview with CEO Philipp P. Spangenberg
","baimos technologies, the Munich, Germany-based company behind BlueID technology – the digital key ring for smartphones, recently raised a seven digit funding round from first class investors. After some weeks, CEO Philipp P. Spangenberg answered our questions about the company, the product, the funding and future plans. 
 FinSMEs: Hi Philipp, can you please tell me more about your career background?
  Philipp: I have been in the mobile security solutions sector for more than 15 years. Back in 2000, I founded my first business, called PPS-Systems. As I regard myself as being an expert in smartphone security, mobile apps and encryption technology, I consult and offer advice on behalf of large companies in the automotive and IT sectors. In 2006, I joined baimos technologies as CEO. In this position, my responsibilities are to manage the Commercial and Technical business units. Baimos technologies was founded as a university project at the TU München. Because of my experience in my former company, I took the role as the technical leader to drive the project.
 FinSMEs: Let’s speak about baimos technologies. What problems do you want to solve?
 Philipp: Baimos technologies specialises in secure mobile communication and authorisation management for smart devices to enable secure interaction with embedded sensors and actuators. Our team of specialists has developed software that can turn any smartphone into a secure mobile key to operate doors, cars, barriers, cabinets or basically anything related to Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Our main goal is to make keys and electronic key systems obsolete, by using nothing but your smartphone to open doors. We can provide cross-disciplinary expertise between computer science and electrical engineering, to achieve the best possible level of security and practical interaction of embedded systems within their smart environment.
 FinSMEs: Can you explain in detail what BlueID does? Which applications can it enable?
 Philipp: BlueID is a highly secure technology which enables authorization management via smartphone. Basically, we help provider to authenticate the user at physical objects by granting secure temporary keys into their apps. The software makes it possible to receive sensitive authorizations in a secure manner and these can be verified locally and most importantly offline. Our patent-protected offline functionality is the main advantage in the market of identification technologies. It ensures local communication, authentication and authorization – offline and within one second. BlueID provides strong security for digital keys stored on the smartphone, but does not require additional secure elements on the device itself. It works with all communication standards such as Bluetooth Smart, NFC, WiFi and of course, mobile internet.
 FinSMEs: Where are you in terms of growth?
 Philipp: As we have analysed the market and the pace of development in our sector, we expect the technology to hit its peak in the next 2-3 years. We would like to grow around 20 percent in 2016. In terms of partnerships, we have been working with several big industry players such as Audi, Daimler, Marquardt, Novero, LG, Dorma and Microsoft.
 FinSMEs: You just raised a seven digit funding round. How are you using the funds?
 Philipp: Since IoT is just starting to develop and the needs for our technology are not even close to their peak, we want to focus on company growth now. We are eager to make BlueID the most reliable and most successful solution in this sector. This new funding will therefore be reinvested into driving our ideas down the road of success, until the lights are all green.
 FinSMEs: What are your future plans?
 Philipp: There are constant changes in the market and due to political regulations, it is nearly impossible to predict the future. But of course we have a clear vision and a focused plan for BlueID. Our solutions are safe and easy to implement into existing systems. This makes our products especially interesting to hotels or shared spaces with many different users and numerous doors to manage. We can basically provide a solution to everyone who interacts with smart devices.
  Gartner predicts that IoT will change cyber security forever; we don’t want to wait for trial and error solutions, but instead want to come up with a practical approach for all interactions in the IoT space. We seek to be the future security stamp in the IoT sector, always one step ahead of our competitors, offering the strongest security and the easiest usage possible.","http://www.finsmes.com/2016/03/baimos-technologies-interview-with-ceo-philipp-p-spangenberg.html

"In the Wake of a Successful IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, The NAGA Group AG Announces Upcoming NAGA Coin (NGC) Token Sale
","The NAGA Group AG is a German FinTech company listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with over 150 employees. Today, they officially announced their Token Sale to launch the NAGA Coin (NGC) and create the first Blockchain-based ecosystem for decentralized trading, investing and education in financial markets, virtual goods and cryptocurrencies.
 Video about The NAGA Group AG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMHAmilB_3w
 Who is The NAGA Group AG?
 After performing one of the fastest IPOs and being listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on July 10th 2017, The NAGA Group AG saw a share price increase of 400% in less than 3 months, The NAGA Group AG (ISIN: DE000A161NR7) is currently offering two platforms based around the trading of financial instruments and virtual items. Founded with the mission to make financial transactions in stocks, cryptocurrencies and the gaming market more transparent, secure and accessible to everyone, the NAGA team stands for disruptive and innovative solutions in the online trading and gaming world.
 NAGA’s first venture is an online trading platform and social network for traders called SwipeStox (iOS | Android apps), which has been in operation since early 2015. The SwipeStox trading platform is home to thousands of registered users and facilitates several thousand transactions each month. The second venture called Switex is currently under development and will be launched in beta in Q1 2018.
 The NAGA Ecosystem
 
 NAGA has a CySEC-regulated brokerage firm and asset management company within the group called NAGA Markets Ltd. (former Hanseatic Brokerhouse Global Markets Ltd.) based in Cyprus that specializes in Forex and CFD trading. Furthermore, NAGA’s sales and lead-generating engine HBS AG (Hanseatic Brokerhouse Germany & Spain) focuses on the acquisition and support of traditional customers in the trading segment.
 SwipeStox (available for iOS, Android and Web), which is directly connected to NAGA Markets Ltd., supplements the company’s product offering and allows customers to access a more modern and mobile-oriented trading platform. SwipeStox’ technology solution also offers open interfaces for other third-party brokers which are able to benefit from the company’s technology solution. Depending on the strategic orientation, NAGA therefore can expand its own ecosystem through its own network as well as through a stronger involvement of partners.
 NAGA’s second venture, Switex, has enormous disruption potential and is the ideal addition to the ecosystem as it allows for the connection of the financial trading world with the gaming world. With several offices across major European countries, including Germany (2 offices in Hamburg), Spain (offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Palma de Mallorca), and Cyprus (Limassol), NAGA today has access to more than 20,000 paying clients from more than 100 countries.
 Within its ecosystem, NAGA combines the elements of social media networks (chats, channels, video and add server, follow and watch functions) in its products alongside the more classical approach of trading. Users of the platform produce daily contributions (“User-Generated Content”). Similar to platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook, the community creates and shares content themselves free of charge, thereby enhancing viral growth without incurring any additional costs for NAGA.
 NAGA Wallet
 
 NAGA will enable the transfer of tokens via the NAGA Wallet into SwipeStox and Switex and all future projects that fall within the NAGA ecosystem. Every platform user can choose between different blockchain assets as a source of payment within the NAGA Wallet. Furthermore, the user can conveniently convert a wide range of blockchain assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), etc. from one to another by simply using his personal NAGA Wallet (and of course the NGC). The web and later mobile application facilitates the storage of all major cryptocurrencies, the easy management of crypto portfolios, simple transfers of funds between peers, and a multitude of other functionalities.
 The NAGA Wallet plays a central role in the NAGA ecosystem. It serves as a secure wallet for its users which allows the deposit and exchange of cryptocurrencies and fiat money, as well as being a solution to facilitate investments in stocks or trade virtual goods. The NGC will serve as the universal base currency with a direct integration into SwipeStox and Switex as well as all upcoming products within the NAGA Ecosystem.
 NAGA Debit Card
 Every crypto investor faces the same problem: opportunities to exchange digital tokens for goods and services in our everyday lives are very limited. Buying goods and services with cryptocurrencies should be as easy as buying with USD, EUR, or JPY.
 To solve this problem, NAGA will also introduce the NAGA debit card, allowing users to spend their cryptocurrencies in millions of online and offline locations worldwide. In fact, everyone who purchases NGC during the token sale is already an early user of the Naga Wallet. As it allows users to buy NGCs with BTC, ETH, LTC, DASH or with FIAT currencies using their credit card or bank transfer, it is the first Proof of Concept.

 PRESS RELEASE
 MUNICH / BONN – 02.12.2014
 Fast-growing 3D printing consumer market emerging: High-Tech Gruenderfonds (HTGF) invests in All3DP GmbH
 The Munich-based tech company All3DP GmbH is closing the gap between consumers and the 3D printing cosmos. All3DP’s consumer-oriented website provides extensive editorial coverage on topics related to 3D printing and offers an online marketplace for tested 3D printable designs. In order to establish the first mover and future global player in the market, High-Tech Gruenderfonds is funding the new startup company.
 3D printing will be one of the key technologies in the coming decades – analysts are forecasting strong growth. This view is shared by High-Tech Gruenderfonds, which, together with four other angel investors is investing in All3DP GmbH, a startup company located in Munich, Germany. All3DP’s mission is to be the number one point of contact for consumers and small businesses interested in 3D printing. To this end, All3DP publishes user-oriented editorial content on its website in English and also offers an online marketplace for 3D printable objects. Marvin D. Andrä, Investment Manager at High-Tech Gruenderfonds, is pleased with their new investment, “3D printing technology has a tremendous disruptive potential. We are convinced that, with the three very experienced founders of the company, we are establishing a global player and thereby contributing to developing a sustainable market.”
 “Typically when people hear about 3D printing, they immediately think of plastic objects made on a home 3D printer,” says Mathias Plica, who is Co-Founder and CEO of All3DP. “Most consumers are unaware of the fact that you can also 3D print objects in high quality materials such as steel, gold, ceramic or titanium.” Plica adds that you don’t necessarily have to own a printer to obtain a 3D printed product that you have had your eyes on. At a reasonable price you can purchase individual items online from a professional 3D printing service provider.
 In order for a 3D printer to be able to create an object, it needs a digital “blueprint.” A wealth of these design files will become available on the online marketplace at All3DP.com in the coming months. “The existing online marketplaces for 3D designs are all too often confusing or the design files have not been curated. A lot can go wrong as a result. All3DP, on the other hand, checks the design files before they are made available to customers for ordering 3D printed objects from a printing service provider,” explains Stefan Schwarz-Ulrich, Co-Founder and Mathematician.
 Co-Founder and Journalist Anatol Locker is responsible for website content and traffic. Locker is in the process of creating relevant English-language editorial content that attracts users around the world. “The developments in the 3D printing market are changing so rapidly that there is exciting news to report on every single day. We aim to build on the momentum of the atmosphere of change in the 3D printing industry and fuel it as well.” Locker, who is a tech journalist, further explains that the website is primarily geared towards information that is helpful to users. “We have the expertise to address not only 3D professionals but also the general public – and we intend to make good use of that advantage.”

"crossvertise, Interview with CEO Matthias Völcker
","Launched in 2009, Munich-based start-up crossvertise provides a cross-media booking platform for advertising media. Recently, it received an investment from High-Tech Gründerfonds and BambooVentures (read here).
 We met CEO Matthias Völcker, who frankly told us a little bit more about the company, the product and the team, the funding and future plans.
 FinSMEs: Hello, Matthias, thank you for joining us. First, can you tell us a something about crossvertise? How did you come up with the idea of creating the company?
 Matthias: Well, in a nutshell: crossvertise is the first media marketplace for every kind of (online and offline) advertising media, where companies as well as agencies can get profound information about the advertising market and have the possibility to book ads easily by themselves. In this way media buying is as easy as buying a book online for example.
 So how did we get the idea? We were working as management consultants and came in touch with media in the course of some projects we were in charge of. Due to our own hardships in finding profound information and media data, not to mention the opportunity to book the requested media on our own, we decided to attend to that matter. Of course we were new in this area and had to learn a lot. But afterwards it turned out, that this was a fortunate coincidence as we came up against all possible difficulties and were able to understand the needs of our clients. With help of several experts, professional literature and lots of practical training we learned the ropes of media business very quickly. After nearly two and a half year we now have got comprehensive knowledge, a wide network and strong partners in every media type.
 
 FinSMEs: What is it? How does it work?
 Matthias: crossvertise is a platform that connects the demand and the supply side in the media industry efficiently. It enables advertisers to save time and money and it offers publishers an additional and strong sales channel. Advertisers can use the platform including the latest and most extensive media data free of charge and find suitable media even without having specialized knowledge or using expensive software. They can request offers and negotiate with several publishers at the same time and purchase all types of media from one single source and with one simple click. Compared with platforms offering only one or two media types, publishers benefit from crossmedia synergies, because advertisers get to know complementary ways of doing advertisement they never would have thought of.
 FinSMEs: What’s your business model?
 Matthias: crossvertise acts as intermediary (broker), matching the supply and demand side in the advertising industry. Besides the regular market commission charged from publishers upon every booking (usually 15%), revenue is generated with premium accounts and other additional services available for advertisers. Thereby crossvertise initially addresses SMEs with small to medium size media budgets and small agencies, which are not equipped with expensive high class software and media data.
 FinSMEs: Could you tell us a bit more about the features that differentiate the service from competitors?
 Matthias: First of all we are the only company to bundle all media types on a single online platform that is open to the public. This means that advertisers can get direct access to a majority of the available media in the categories print (>18.000 newspapers, magazines etc.), online & mobile (> 5000 websites and apps), out-of-home (>160.000 billboards), radio (>500 stations), cinema (>4.800 screens) and TV (~ 400 stations on demand) and usually even have a price advantage using crossvertise.
 Secondly we are transparent, provide independent information and vast media data for free and present innovative and often unknown ad specials regularly. This is also new in this sector!
 And finally, due to our strong partner network, we can convey complementary services such as media planning, creation, production, PR etc. So you could call us a self-service one-stop shop in the on- and offline advertisement industry. But of course we also have a trained call-center and professional customer service available in case someone needs assistance or wishes personal advisory.
 FinSMEs: Could you introduce us the other team members?
 Matthias: Sure, my founding partners are Thomas Masek (COO/CFO) and Maximilian Balbach (CTO). Thomas and I have been working together on the project, initially called werbetraeger24, since two and a half years. Thomas is responsible for operations, human resources and finance. Max joined us at the end of 2010 and has programmed the platform from scratch. He is in charge of product development and the technical implementation. I, in my position as CEO am responsible for strategy, business development, sales and investor relations.
 We have been growing extremely during the last few months and have recruited several media experts and experienced developers for our headquarters in Munich and our off-shore unit in India. We consider ourselves fortunate having found such a great team, where every member complements one another and shares the entrepreneurial spirit with us.
 
 FinSMEs: Why did you start thinking about raising capital?
 Matthias: That´s a good question. After we had received a 100k Euro joint sponsorship of the German government and European Union and started making first revenues, we were fairly thinking about boot strapping. However, there were several reasons that brought us about the decision of raising capital. The focal idea of crossvertise is quite revolutionary and there is a great upside potential that leads to followers trying to copy our business model. After all it is a fast growing 30 billion Euro market in Germany and 350 billion worldwide from which we want to snatch a piece of the cake. In order to retain our first mover advantage and to ramp up our turnover quickly we needed sufficient man power and cash to pay our office and all the other bills. So we searched for investors that share our vision and also have enough capital and a strong network to secure ongoing growth and scalability. Having found such investors and strong partners makes life easier, anyhow.
 FinSMEs: Today, many tech companies try to raise venture capital, I know that this is not easy. What did you do to reach this target? Was it easy to close the deal?
 Matthias: To be honest, we started the search for investors already in January 2011 and never thought that it would take so long to close the deal. After many big players before us had failed due to the incredible complexity, people just didn´t believe that we would ever manage to win enough publishers as well as advertisers to make the marketplace attractive for the reverse side. So we searched for strategic partners and pilot customers to show the proof of concept. After we had aggregated about 80% of available media in Germany in our database, finalized a functional prototype and started making six figure revenue we soon had the first term sheets on our table. Partnerships with Microsoft, Jost von Brandis (one of the leading out-of-home specialist), WerbeWeischer (the leading marketer of cinema advertising) and mediaservice wasmuth (the leading media database developer) of course also made things easier. All in all it was a great deal of work and a situation I will never forget in my life.
 FinSMEs: Who are the investors?
 Matthias: The lead investor is the “High–Tech Gründerfonds” that invests in high potential high-tech start-ups in Germany and has about EUR 560.5 million under management in two funds. Investors in this public/private partnership include the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, the KfW Banking Group, as well as twelve industrial groups of ALTANA, BASF, B. Braun, Robert Bosch, CEWE Color, Daimler, Deutsche Post DHL, Deutsche Telekom, Qiagen, RWE Innogy, Tengelmann and Carl Zeiss.
 Furthermore we are financed by the investment consortium “BambooMedia”, which is bankrolled by the private investors Michael Streich and Dr. Maximilian Levasier (the founder of `BambooVentures GmbH´) as well as Dr. Hellmut Kirchner (“5K Investment GmbH”) plus “FIRST VALUE AG” with numerous financially strong and experienced shareholders.
 FinSMEs: How are you using the capital?
 Matthias: The next challenges are to completely implement the marketplace and to acquire additional customers to expand our market position and boost our revenues. For that reason we are using the resources primarily for the IT infrastructure, recruitment and marketing and PR operations. Especially the recruitment of additional qualified personnel to process the constantly growing number of orders will be a crucial factor, as well as selective advertising measures to increase our awareness.
 FinSMEs: Do you already plan to raise an additional round?
 Matthias: Yes, but in the moment we are 100% focusing on technical progress as well as business development. The amusing thing is that now, that we have finally closed the deal, we get quite interesting investment offers constantly. We will need to monitor the further development and of course keep speaking with investors regularly. Nevertheless we are planning to expand to foreign markets by the end of 2012 and therefore we are still open for talks and offers… you never know!","http://www.finsmes.com/2012/02/crossvertise-interview-ceo-matthias-volcker.html

"Spotcap, Interview with Toby Triebel
","Started in Spain in September 2014, Spotcap aims to enable small business owners worldwide to invest and grow without having to worry about how to fund their projects via an online credit platform that provides flexible financing products.
 Toby Triebel, the co-founder of the Berlin-based, Rocket Internet-backed startup answered our questions about the company, the product, and future plans, which include the imminent launch in the Netherlands.
 FinSMEs: Hi Toby, can you tell us something about you? 
 Toby: I worked in finance for 10 years in London, at Goldman Sachs and Finisterre Capital, where I invested in credit, public and private debt in companies and banks across the globe. In 2014, Jens Woloszczak and I co-founded Spotcap, an online lending platform focused on the needs of micro, small and medium sized enterprises.
 FinSMEs: How did you come up with the Spotcap idea?
 Toby: Regulations are increasing, conditions are getting worse and banks are lending less. We know that small companies face significant challenges to access capital. Given this, we found an opportunity to combine technology and finance to provide loans to small businesses to help them grow.
 FinSMEs: What’s Spotcap?
 Toby: Spotcap is a fintech company leveraging big data to provide financing solutions to small businesses. We went live in September 2014 in Spain and we are now expanding to new markets, firstly to the Netherlands this week.
 FinSMEs: Are you trying to disintermediate the relationship between the lender and the borrower?
 Toby: No, we are not. Instead, we are trying to fill a gap in the market by providing loans to micro, small and medium sized enterprises that are underserved by traditional banks, which don’t have the capacity and don’t want to serve them because they are too young, too small, etc. We do it by offering very competitive lending products, which are extremely fast to get. Users can apply in minutes, and get cash the next business day, transparently and easily.
 FinSMEs: In 2014, we saw business finance startups going public in the USA. Other companies are growing. In this framework, what distinguishes Spotcap from its competitors? 
 Toby: Firstly, we don’t have a p2p approach. In this regard, we are more similar to a bank providing the funding ourselves and not taking retail money. In addition, from a product perspective, we spent months on optimizing our solution, to make the application process as quick, easy and transparent as possible, for example.
 Finally, we aim to become the global leader in online small business lending and competition is something that we don’t fear at all.
 FinSMEs: Why did you start from Spain and (now) the Netherlands? Regulation reasons?
 Toby: No, we consider market opportunity reasons. Let’s have a look at Spain: it has more than 3m SMEs, employing 80% of the total private workforce in the country. But they face tremendous challenges in accessing capital to grow, having trouble with banks… In a few words, the business financing gap is particularly acute. Given this, 1) the opportunity and 2) the necessity of our product were the two main reasons that brought us to think about Spain as our first market.
 FinSMEs: What about your team?
 Toby: We have 50 people. The core team is already in place in Berlin with plans to open sales offices while launching the platform in the various countries.
 FinSMEs: Have you already raised venture capital? Are you in the process to raise new funds?
 Toby: We raised a €13m Series A funding round in 2014 (from Rocket Internet, HV Holtzbrinck Ventures, Access Industries) and we plan to raise additional vc rounds but I can’t release any further detail. 
 FinSMEs: In your opinion, will we see high street banks start acquiring services like Spotcap?
 Toby: We haven’t seen this yet. In contrast, we have started seeing partnerships between online platforms and banks and, in my opinion, this is what we can expect to see in the near future.","http://www.finsmes.com/2015/03/spotcap-interview-with-toby-triebel.html

"GameGenetics, Exclusive Interview with CEO Alexander Piutti
","
 Recenly GameGenetics, a Berlin, Germany-based aggregator and distributor of free-to-play online games, raised a Series A funding in the seven-digit Euro figure (read here). Today, CEO and founder Alexander Piutti joined us to talk about the company, its solution, and team and future plans.
 FinSMEs: Hello, Alexander, thank you for joining us. First, can you tell us a something about gamegenetics.com? How did you come up with the idea of creating the company?
 Alexander: Hi Ermanno, many thanks for your interest. In 2009, we saw an increasing need for online game developers to ramp up their professional marketing and distribution efforts. At the same time, we learned from major portals and gaming websites that it is hard for them to find the ‘right’ games for their audience. So we figured that someone should build that bridge and match supply and demand in a rapidly growing market 😉
 FinSMEs: What is it? How does it work?
 Alexander: The concept of free-to-play games was successfully established in South Korea. Surprisingly, German online game developers such as Bigpoint, Travian Games, InnoGames and Gameforge — to name a few — were also first movers in that respect in a global context. Our job is to support those guys in reaching their global audience. We do that by – for example – building game channels for portals and gaming sites in more than 20 countries today. Those game channels are created and maintained by us, while we make sure every channel partner gets the best-possible mix of free-to-play games through us – exactly matching their respective audience. Basically, we can partner with anybody that owns traffic such as traffic networks, agencies and marketeers. We help those players to successfully monetize their traffic with our popular free-to-play games.
 FinSMEs: What’s your business model?
 Alexander: We share the revenue with our channel partners that is generated by each game or provided by game developers in terms of marketing budget. It’s a true win/win model for all parties involved.
 FinSMEs: Could you tell us a bit more about the features that differentiate the service from competitors?
 Alexander: we are often told we have the most diverse portfolio of free-to-play online games. Actually, it took us three years to build strong ties to our game partners which is probably not easy to replicate. In addition, we invested heavily in our marketing and distribution technology from day one. Today, we benefit from our early technology approach which enables us to deliver billions of game views every month across the globe.
 FinSMEs: Could you introduce us the other team members?
 Alexander: our team is quite passionate to introduce a disruptive distribution approach to an exploding  market. Our growing team shows a diverse mix of international folks that love online games.
 FinSMEs: Why did you start thinking about raising capital?
 Alexander: fairly early. We did our first round 5 days after setting up shop. I knew that we wouldn’t be able to scale appropriately in the absence of cash.
 FinSMEs: What did you do to raise vc? Was it easy to close the deal?
 Alexander: our current lead investor is getting more than 1.000 funding requests per year, while investing into 0-5 companies during the same period. Hence, competition for the best investors is fierce. However, i believe that our experience in B2B-models and our execution speed helped us to partner with a leading VC.
 FinSMEs: Who are the investors?
 Alexander: Our investors include Target Partners, High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF) and estag capital.
 FinSMEs: How are you using the capital?
