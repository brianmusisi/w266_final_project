"Africa&#8217;s Talking joins Open Banking Nigeria to develop open APIs for banking
","Open Banking Nigeria has announced a partnership with Africas Talking to develop open APIs for banking.
 Africa’s Talking has joined [other] companies partnering with Open Banking Nigeria in the development of Open APIs for the Nigerian financial industry, wrote Open Banking Nigeria.
 The announcement was made a week ago in a blog post by Open Banking Nigeria.
 According to Open Banking, this move is in line with what Africas Talking does. And, it will also strengthen the companies value proposition not only in Nigeria but across the continent.
 
 To further strengthen their objectives of unlocking the potential of mobile communication networks across Africa by simplifying the process and technologies required to exploit them, the organization has teamed up with Open Banking Nigeria to help extend this innovation.
 
 Africa’s Taking Country Director, Simon Aderinlola, said that Open Banking Nigeria has a huge potential to drive financial inclusion as well as boost innovation in Nigeria. They have also struck the partnership to create security and safety for customers to share their financial data with banks or third parties.
 He added that this would open the doors to millions of Nigerians currently out of the financial market”.
 Africa’s Talking provides communication APIs for SMS, USSD, voice, and more. This helps technology startups and large companies communicate with their customers across Africa.
 Founded in 2010 by Kenyans Sam Gikandi (CEO) and Eston Kimani (Director), they have raised at least $14.6 Million in funding.
 The latest round was $8.6 Million which they closed in April this year. Led by IFC Venture Capital Group with participation from Orange Digital Ventures. The company recently announced expansion plans into West African markets.
 Open Banking says that besides Africas Talking, they have also so far secured Open Vector, TeamApt, and other companies.
 As a not-for-profit, Open Banking Nigeria gets its funding from partner companies. But, it doesnt specify if they have packages like Gold, Silver etc. at which the partner companies join. Though, all the products developed are free for use by everyone including banks, OFIs, developers and more.

"Who will lead the African online privacy and data conversation?
","According to Menabytes, Egyptian ride-hailing company, Careem, was hit by a cyber attack on January 14, 2018. “Data of all the 14 million Careem customers (at the time) and captains was stolen as a result of the attack,” wrote Menabytes.
 “The information stolen included customers’ name[s], email addresses, phone numbers and the trip data. The company did not specify what is included in the trip data but it is safe to assume that all the trip history of the customers was part of it.”
 Data protection and online privacy have been at the center of the conversations for many following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Yet, online data and privacy issues in Africa have largely been on the sidelines.
 In turn, while as Facebook’s users in Europe are being protected by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), those in Africa are subject to being “governed by terms of service agreed with the company’s international headquarters in Ireland” as Reuters wrote.
 According to Internet Society, Africas privacy challenges are unique. Partly because of a general lack of awareness of the risks involved in the use of information and communication technologies [across the continent].
 Like Facebook, several technology companies are always working towards avoiding fines or penalties in case they are found in violation of privacy policies or breach of their contracts. So far, they have been unlucky in the EU. The bloc is the perfect model of commitment to enforcing privacy policies for its citizens.
 However, Africa, as a continent is heavily lagging behind, despite the fact that the internet and ICT are continuously becoming an integral part of its citizens as well as a significant contributor to its GDP.
 According to a 2013 McKinsey &amp; Company report, “the internet will contribute US $300 billion to Africa’s GDP by 2025.” It also projected that the internet’s contribution to Africa’s GDP would jump from the then 1.1% in 2012 to about 4%- 5%. The number of internet users would also jump from about 350 Million to over 600 Million.
 At the country level, Daily News Egypt reported that “the contribution of the ICT sector to GDP was high, at 12.5%, in FY 2016/2017, increasing from 8.3% in FY 2015/2016.” In Nigeria, the ICT sector contributes around 12.5% to the country’s GDP. Similarly, the ICT sector contributed 2.9% of total GDP to the South African economy in 2012. The figure is expected to have increased significantly in the past 6 years.
 However, despite the fact that the sector is becoming significant to the continent, there are some costs associated with it that the African governments or concerned authority haven’t moved fast enough to address. One of them being breach of online privacy and misuse of the data.
 Apart from the Careem incident, in October last year, iAfrikan reported that South Africa had “suffered its largest data breach” ever as “millions of personal records” were “leaked on the Internet”. It is also believed that Cambridge Analytica had a hand in the controversial Kenyan elections held last year. The same was reported about the Nigerian elections that happened in 2015.
 Yet, amidst all this, all concerned parties across the continent seem unmoved by the trend. Even when there were allegations that China bugged the African Union headquarters and spied on the African heads of states.
 When you make an anecdote analysis, all companies that are fast rising in Africa are data backed. M-Kopa, the Nairobi-based fintech, and energy company has control of data for about 600,000 households in Africa.
 Jumia, the Lagos-based e-commerce giant, according to its 2017 report, now has over 2.2 Million Africans shopping from across its platforms in Africa. The same applies to Uber, Taxify, Careem and other technology startups across Africa.
 These companies are collecting data yet there are no clear guidelines on what they can or can not do with it. For example, although most of the companies claim to be pan-African, they are founded by expatriates from Europe and the U.S.
 These, though operating from Africa, are ultimately satellite controlled from either the U.S or Europe. Something that raises questions about how far the data the companies collect travels and what it is ultimately used for.
 In February this year, different African experts gathered for two days (19-20 February 2018) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to contribute to the development of the African Privacy and Personal Data Protection Guidelines.
 According to Verangai Mabika, the meeting came “amidst growing concern across the world on the need to prepare for the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will be enforced on 25 May 2018.” An indicator of strides being made.
 Yet, as Verangai later noted, “only 16 of the 55 [African] countries having adopted comprehensive privacy laws regulating the collection and use of personal information.”

"Facebook has finally decided to monetize the Whatsapp Business feature
","After splashing over $19 Billion to acquire WhatsApp, Facebook seems to be finally figuring out how to make money out of the messaging platform. And that is going to be through businesses.
 WhatsApp announced that it has launched a new way designed to help businesses communicate with their customers on its platform.
 Today we are expanding our support for businesses that need more powerful tools to communicate with their customers, WhatsApp wrote.
 They have introduced a Business API and they believe it will change the way businesses communicate with their customers in three areas; starting a conversation, requesting information and getting support.
 It is looking to ride on the increasing need for instant communication as well as a more conversational style of receiving support. Something that may not be achieved when using the more formal or established forms.
 Its quicker and easier to chat with a business than making a call or sending an e-mail, the messaging company wrote.
 The businesses will be charged per message they send an effort that will deter them from spamming their customers.
 Though WhatsApp says that it will allow businesses to respond to customer queries at no charge for up to 24 hours. The charge will only kick in beyond and will billed per message.
 Businesses will pay to send certain messages so they are selective and your chats dont get cluttered, wrote the company.
 To help you understand this, consider this;
 When a client reaches out to a business with a question, the business will be able to respond for free within 24 hours. Any messages sent by the business outside of the 24-hour window will be charged. However, if the customer responds with another query, that restarts a 24-hour cycle.

 WhatsApps target here is to keep the already active users glued to its platform. As long as they are getting quick answers from businesses, they will prefer it to other channels.
 Perhaps to avoid issues of privacy  that have already bitten the parent company  from arising, WhatsApp pointed out that the messages will still remain end-to-end encrypted.
 Besides the new Business API, Facebook will as well be offering ads via its Ads Manager that open a WhatsApp chat.
 “When a person taps on an Ad that clicks to WhatsApp, they will be transferred to a pre-filled WhatsApp chat where they can message your business quickly,” writes Facebook.
 As one uses the ads, they will get metrics for the number of conversations started using the ad and the total number of messages people sent their business via the ad.
 Whatsapp co-founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, both left Facebook over data privacy and the messaging app’s business model according to The Washington Post. Perhaps they were the reason the social media company had delayed implementing such a business model.

"How Uganda&#8217;s Startup Economy Fell Behind Kenya (and Why Catching-Up is Not the Option)
","I am no thought leader when it comes to tech ecosystems or startups but I surely have my own opinions. Seeing as you are reading this, you might as well read on but first help me answer a few questions that I have had to face that put things into perspective for me.
 
 How many startups in Uganda have attracted funds externally and gone on to grow regionally?, asked a brilliant Indian American venture capitalist working with the IFC as I settled into his DC office.
 What would you say is the most successful startup in Uganda that I must know about?, He went on.
 “The numbers show that 50% of African tech ecosystem is in 5 countries. Kenya being one of these, why is the ecosystem there so much different from Uganda’s?, He concluded.
 
 Thank God for a report by Virgin Group that names Uganda the most entrepreneurial country in the world  I always seem to have a comeback.
 I would really love to here your answers but lets explore further the differences between the two countries.
 First movers vs Fast movers.
 The Kenyan ecosystem is known for both. This is not about one and not the other for them. In a post written in March 2010, the iHub was announced to the world in what would be a FIRST for the region. About the same time infoDev, the government of Finland, and Nokia launched the Creating Sustainable Businesses in the Knowledge Economy (CSBKE) program to derive and test new approaches to advancing innovation and entrepreneurship in developing countries.
 An extract about the program quotes;
 “ Based on the vast growth of mobile content and access technology, a large part of the program focused on support for innovation in mobile applications and software (or “apps”). Through CSBKE, the concept of “mobile entrepreneurship enablers” was developed, of which two forms were tested: Mobile Application Laboratories (mLabs) and Mobile Social Networking Hubs (mHubs). mLabs are specialized mobile app business incubation and acceleration service providers; mHubs focus on mobile tech community building by convening stakeholder groups at informal gatherings. mLabs were intended to reach a region comprising several countries, whereas mHubs serve only a single city.
 Uganda got an mHub, in other-wards serving only a single city — Kampala. This was the popular MobileMonday that everyone would smile at first mention given the impact it created and how it converged the ecosystem under topical themes. Unfortunately this is no more. Reports by infodev will show this was funded $35,000.
 On the other-hand, Kenya got both an mHub and mLab  funded $55,000 and $850,000 respectively. In other-wards, spanning regions comprising several countries (mLab), but also serving only a single city  Nairobi (mHub). So what? you ask. This is not about the money, its about the difference between an mHub and an mLab. See for yourself.
 
 An illustration of the difference in services offered by an mHub and an mLab
 It is fair to say based on the what is currently happening in the Ugandan ecosystem we are seeing more of events, conferencing and workshops.
 We seem to have caught the bug and cant seem to have enough of it. Take a pick of any week/month/day and you will find not less than one event happening that you would like to attend focusing on innovation this — innovation that.
 All the while the Kenyan ecosystem was nurturing the complimentary critical components that make an ecosystem tick. These included aspects that have since become a mainstay in Nairobi like formal mentor-ships by experienced entrepreneurs, prototyping events(not talks), contacts to investor networks, formalized incubation programs among others listed up there.
 How does Uganda catch up? Not the option!
 I remember listening to Dave McClure of 500Startups at the Dubai Future Accelerator the evening he just flew from Nairobi to speak at The fourth Angel Fair Africa. The Fair is another story for another day but featured speakers such as Chris Kirubi (Chairman of Centum Investment Group), Tim Draper (Founding Partner of Draper Associates) and Dave himself.
 In Dubai, Dave was explaining the factors that have shaped their fortunes. A key consideration was the size of the markets. His ideal market is 100 Million potential users of a solution. East Africa, on the other-hand, has a total population of 160 Million people.
 What might you think is the population of actual technology market in the region to adopt solutions?
 This is beyond catching up, or anyone Country in the region thinking its better than the other. Innovators need to begin seeing East Africa and beyond as one market.
 Think BIG; then after that  think BIGGER, Think global then act local  local being the region not your country.
 View you venture in light of the questions at the beginning.
 Can your startup attract funds externally and go on to grow regionally?
 How does your startup rate regionally? What would it take for you to be the most successful startup?
 Who is across the boarder that I can collaborate with?
 The next challenge for startups, and sector players in the region is how well we converge to build a connected ecosystem across boarders leveraging each others uniqueness.

"Tech hubs in Africa should focus on being what they are, Hubs; research paper recommends
","A recently released paper has recommended that tech hubs in Africa need to focus on what they are. Being hubs. Leaving whatever is out of their mandate to other players in the ecosystem, to handle.
 The paper recognizes the role hubs are playing in their respective countries. Yet notes that if they focused, they’d achieve more.
 The paper is focused on social technology in sub-Saharan Africa. And pointed out some of the areas where tech hubs across the continent have gone astray. During the course of their work.
 Also, read: There are 442 active tech hubs in Africa, GSMA 2018 report
 According to the paper, tech hubs in Africa are trying to provide solutions to all problems in their respective ecosystems. “As important as hubs have become, it is critical to recognize that no single type of institution can provide an ecosystem,” the paper notes.
 It also points out that hubs have profiled themselves as a go-to entity for all problems an ecosystem has. Even when they might not be the best-positioned player to solve them.
 A presence of donor funds, according to the paper, has also fueled this. Even when the people receiving the funding aren’t the best placed to start such facilities.
 “Much of this divergence, however, is because many hub administrators are ‘winging it’, tactically responding to demand from local actors or funding from international donors, and often operating without adequate training or support.
 Hubs are trying to be the investor, mediators with governments, education institutions, co-working spaces and incubators at the same time. Amidst all this, they are getting distracted by whatever they set out to do initially.
 “Perhaps the most significant factor we found, across many hubs in many countries, was that hubs are under a great deal of pressure to provide all services,” cites the paper.
 Adding that “hubs have the job of not only working with the startup but also educating the ecosystem. They talk policy with government and with embassies.”
 Also, read: Here’s why Ugandan hubs are coming together
 The paper also found that trying to balance between “keeping the lights on” on a day-to-day basis as well as achieving sustainability is one of the key issues leading to deviating from their core.
 “The issue for hubs is that they sit across many fault lines, not making enough money to be interesting to big investors, not having enough money to do social impact research and work to impress NGOs on a consistent and long-term basis,” one of the people the researchers interviewed commented.
 Some of the ways they try to survive are through offering a cocktail of services.
 “A diversified mix of income was also important. Income streams might include in-kind support (e.g., internet); no-strings-attached corporate social responsibility sponsorship, grants and revenue from hosting hackathons for companies; providing business development services; or consulting.”
 The paper defined a hub as “an enterprise that offers a collaborative workspace, where new ideas and enterprises are created and supported.” A definition that failed to exactly define and demarcate what entails a tech hub in Africa’s mandate. Even when the definition added that “at a minimum, hubs provide glacially-paced wifi and a desk.”
 According to the paper, hubs are not grounded to the problems affecting the bottom of the pyramid. Who, actually, form the majority of the populace in areas they operate.
 Also, read: Two Ugandan law firms have partnered to launch a tech hub in Kampala
 Criticizing them also for fueling the development of products that are actually better suited for the urbanites.
 “An app for the rural or poor, when smartphone app usage is tied to urbanites with surplus income” is one of the descriptive examples cited.
 Part of this is blamed on the copy and paste of the Silicon Valley culture. A foundation on which most of the tech hubs in Africa are (still being) built.
 
 “As much as tech hubs in sub-Saharan Africa are being overwhelmed with demands to replace the missing parts of what should be an ecosystem, innovators are similarly being trained to model their professional approach on the example of a Sergey Brin (Google co-founder) or Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook co-founder).”
 
 The paper makes several recommendations. Some of which, the researchers believe will help tech hubs in Africa improve their work.
 Funding of ideas and solutions that are solving actual and real problems is one of them. Rather than the fancy and “quick win mobile app” solutions.
 “Much of the work over the last ten years has concentrated on ‘quick win’ mobile apps. It is time for a broader idea of what is possible with social tech, and better research and funding for innovations that don’t simply leverage Western techniques against African conditions, but reward local techniques to solve local problems.”
 The paper also recommends that “funders should avoid adding ‘feature creep’ to hubs, enlarging their mandate and missions.” While cautioning them that as much as they are paying attention to hubs, they, alone, can not form the ecosystem.
 “Hubs cannot replace the rest of the ecosystem or compensate for every ecosystem Weakness,” the paper pointed out. Recommending that they should, instread, diversify their support.
 
 “Equal donor attention must be focused on other parts, like education and training, lobbying for better regulation, more investment during the ‘messy middle’ phase ‘between the conclusion of a pilot program and the ultimate wide-scale operation and optimization’ of an innovation, and improved tech access for the scaling process.”
 
 The paper was authored by five researchers; Rodrigues Gemma, Csíkszentmihályi Christopher, Mwesigwa Daniel, Mukundane Jude and Kasprzak Michelle. And, the survey, from which the paper was derived, was commissioned by three UK foundations.
 The aim of the study was to “paint a ‘broad brush’ picture of the ecosystems for technology innovation across the region, highlighting those ecosystem characteristics present in multiple national contexts.”
 This includes “the arrival and spread of tech hubs; interactions with Silicon Valley models of innovation on; the outsize influence of telcos; the advent of social media bundles and absence of net neutrality; and implicit bias against Africans and racism in funding.”
 Though most, if not all, of the findings of the paper, are not groundbreaking, they will guide conversations geared towards building the ecosystem.

"Naspers to list MultiChoice on JSE next year as it eyes Pay-TV exit
","Naspers, Africas most valuable company, seems to be looking for an exit from pay-TV. According to the statement issued by the company, it will spin off Multichoice next year.
 Naspers today announced its intention to list its Video Entertainment business separately on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and simultaneously to unbundle the shares in this business to its shareholders, wrote Naspers.
 The spun-off company will be known as MultiChoice Group. This will include MultiChoice South Africa, MultiChoice Africa, Showmax Africa, and Irdeto. Though Naspers will keep its primary listing on the JSE.
 Bob van Dijk, the CEO, pointed out that this is a key step towards Naspers becoming an internet company. This marks a significant step for the Naspers Group as we continue our evolution into a global consumer internet company, he said.
 Listing MultiChoice Group via unbundling aims to unlock value for Naspers shareholders and at the same time create an empowered, top 40 JSE-listed African entertainment company.”
 Naspers pioneered Africas video entertainment industry with its satellite TV service. Launched in 1995, DSTV has grown to over 50 countries in Africa.

 The company pointed out that their Video Entertainment business is one of the fastest growing pay-TV operators globally. Adding that its multi-platform business entertains 13.5 million households across Africa. But, this growth might not last. As long as the like of Netflix continue to cannibalize on their existent subscribers.
 In fact, one could be safe to conclude that perhaps Naspers doesnt see a future for the video entertainment service. Hence the focus on becoming an internet company.
 Founded in 1915, Naspers has been very active when it comes to investments as well as exits.
 In March, it announced its intentions to sell stock worth more than $10bn, equal to 2 percent of the shares in Tencent. Additionally, it sold its 11.18% stake in Indias Flipkart to US retailer, Walmart for $2.2 billion in May this year. It also exited Nigerias Konga albeit at a loss.
 The company has shown where the billions it raised from exits will be going. First, by investing $500 billion in US-based Letgo through OLX Group. It also led Moviles $124 million round in July.

"Qwicart, Evelyn Namara dominate MTN Innovation Awards 2017
","Last evening, the MTN Innovation Awards 2017 were held at Serena hotel to celebrate Ugandan innovators in the application space. The awards saw the founders of e-Commerce platform, Qwicart, walk away with two awards. The same number that Evelyn Namara, combined with her ventures first product M-Voucher won.
 The awards that had 9 categories shortlisted 45 nominees. Of which, the winner in each category walked away with $3,000. The categories were Health, Education, financial services, SME, Agriculture, Media and Entertainment, most innovative, Outstanding woman innovation and innovation achiever of the year.
 The first award went to myChild App for the best education app. The best financial services app went to Mambopay, having been among the nominees in 2015 and failing to win. The best SME app was Qwicart, which was launched by Joshua Mugisha  the former BrighterMonday Uganda Country Manager. The app also won the most innovative app award.
 The best health app was PRISMS, best agriculture was M-Voucher by !nnovate, and best media and entertainment went to AppAbout.
 The innovative achiever was won by Gonahasa David, the founder of RoundBob and lastly, Evelyn Namara won the outstanding woman innovation award. (See also: Does MTN Organize Innovation Awards and Competitions to Steal Ideas?)
 TMS Ruge gave the opening speech which resonated well with the innovators. The keynote was given by Fred Otunnu, the director of communications at Uganda Communications Commission, on behalf of the ICT minister, Frank Tumwebaze. (See also: Minister Frank Tumwebaze breaks ground for the construction of government ICT Hub in Nakawa)
 In his speech, he re-emphasized the importance of innovation to solve the problems in the country. He also highlighted the fact that the awards had categories covering the key issues affecting the country like health, education etc.
 Yet, a few people still felt the awards should not only focus on apps but solutions in general. This was based on the fact that some judges were asking for apps from solutions that didnt necessarily need applications.
 One particular scenario is that of The Innovation Village and Up Accelerate where one of the judges was asking them for their apps. It is not that all solutions need apps.
 Another improvement that needs to be made is raising the bar of nomination. Some solutions that were nominated were not convincing enough. This will keep people who feel their solutions are above the bar from participating.
 Lastly, it is hard to have someone who has never been an innovator to judge an innovation. Theres a huge difference between reading about how to get your hands dirty and actually getting them dirty. Judges should at least be innovators themselves. That way, theyll appreciate the process and probably have better criteria to judge.
 Yet, being just the second year, the awards still have room for improvement as well as help elevate more innovations from Uganda.

 Shola Adekoya joined Konga as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in July 2013 before taking over as CEO from Sim Shagaya, the founder.
 Prior to joining Konga, Shola was in charge of Financial Planning and Budgeting at Etisalat Nigeria  a Nigerian telecom operator which changed its name to 9Mobile.

 Nick Imudia will take over from Shola. Though, at a time when Konga is weathering storm after storm. Since mid-2017, the company has had to withstand tough times from layoffs, pivoting the business model to an underwhelming acquisition.
 It is rumoured that the company was acquired by Zinox for a figure in the region of $10 Million. Given that Konga had raised over $108 Million in funding from both Naspers and Kinnevik, many werent happy with the acquisition.

"Africa&#8217;s technology companies recorded 454 deals worth $1.19B in 2018
","Today, we release our very first report  Digest Africa INDEX  which summarises the investment into Africas early stage and technology companies for the year 2018. Below are the excerpts of the Executive Summary and the Methodology we used.
 Please note that the report is available for purchase at $299 and $999 (with the data). Click here or visit digestafrica.com/products to make the purchase.
 Executive Summary
 The Digest Africa Index highlights key trends, opportunities, and challenges in Africa’s technology landscape by focusing on funding and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals as well as the companies and investors behind them. We also highlight the critical funds that raised across the continent, who are putting money into them and how they have been or are likely to be deployed.
 Last year recorded a whopping $1.19 billion in total deal value even though 103 deals  representing 22.7% of the total 454 deals recorded  never disclosed their amount. However, we also believe that the figure could have been higher than $1.19 billion had the values of certain deals been disclosed. Jumia and M-Kopa are among the companies that never disclosed their deal amounts.
 Technology companies across Africa raised a total of $686.4 million in funding across 336 disclosed funding deals of the 415 recorded. The East African region, with $303.9 million which translated into 44.2% of the total funding raised, registered the highest amount. Amongst countries, Kenya, with 22.8% ($156.5M) of the total funding raised, recorded the highest while the financial services sector recorded the highest amount of funding raised on the continent with 92 deals representing $276.7 million.
 Digest Africa Index Summary
 The financial services sector contributed 40.3% to the total funding raised across the continent in 2018. There were 39 M&amp;A deals recorded in Africa’s technology space though only seven (7) of these were disclosed. South Africa registered the highest number of deals with twenty-four (24) and six (6) of the deals whose amounts were disclosed also came from the country. Compuscan, which Experian acquired for $263 million, and WeBuyCars that was acquired by Naspers for $94 million  through OLX Group  recorded the highest M&amp;A deal values.
 Lastly, a total of sixteen (16) technology-focused funds were raised adding up to $1.094 billion in value. 69.8% of the funds raised were early stage focused and 47.7% of them were sector agnostic. Naspers’ $314 million South Africa-focused fund was the largest fundraising/commitment recorded in 2018. European Investment Bank (EIB) was the most active investor on the continent participating in investments into five (5) funds: Partech Africa Fund managed by Partech Ventures ($70M), Novastar II managed by Novastar Ventures ($72.5M), Tide Africa Fund managed by TLcom Capital ($40M), Sawari Ventures North Africa Fund I managed by Sawari Ventures ($35M) and Africa Tech Ventures ($10M).
 Methodology
 Digest Africa collects the data it uses for the INDEX report from press releases, reputable media companies, publicly available databases like Competition Authority of Tanzania and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as contacting companies and investors. When recording funding, we include debt/loans, grants/awards/prizes/non-equity assistance, venture capital, angel investment, initial coin offerings, crowdfunding and corporate funding. In this report, we attributed the acquisition by an African country of an overseas company to the country of the acquiring company (for now).
 Please note that we only consider for-profit early-stage and technology companies that are either incorporated in Africa or headquartered in Africa. (We use the word technology to also denote companies with innovative business models like Jibu).
 If a for-profit company is not headquartered on the continent, it should either have Africa as its primary or only market. Because of the above criteria, we did not include funding raised by companies like Branch ($20M), African Leadership Academy ($30.7M), iSON Xperiences ($51M), Tala ($65M), D.Light ($116M), Alten Africa ($36M) and others.
 We classified all the companies under ten (10) sectors where most of the funding and M&amp;A activity took place while all the others that fell under areas with insignificant activity are captured under Information Technology. The sector emerging technologies covers drones, the blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technologies that are just beginning to take off on the continent.
 We divided the continent into five (5) regions; Central, East, North, Southern and West Africa. However, because there was not much activity in Central Africa, it was bundled with East Africa for analysis in certain instances. The full list of classification is at the end of the report in the Appendix section.
 We also ensured that we allocated all deals that took place a stage/type (which you can find pointed out in the table in the report). We grouped all the funding stages into nine (9) categories with all pre-seed and seed rounds as well as all funding from accelerators and incubators classified under Seed. All non-equity financing in the form of grants, awards and prizes were categorised under grants. We classified all Series A and Series B rounds under Early Venture, and any deal that was Series C and above fell under Late Venture.
 Important to note is that we only considered deals amounting to $10,000 or more and all values presented in other currencies other than US dollar (USD) were translated into USD using Bloombergs Currency Converter or recorded based on the source if already translated into USD.

 [We] recently embarked on an exciting new public-private partnership with John Deere and the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to deploy 10,000 tractors over the next five years, Jehiel Oliver, the founder and CEO of Hello Tractor, said in an interview with Forbes.
 
 The government will implement a pay-as-you-go model that allows tractors to be leased to new owners over a defined period of time, before being resold to them at a discount.
 
 Hello Tractor connects farmers to tractor owners. It will thus focus on the implementation part using its technology. Hello Tractor will serve as an implementation partner, providing tractor monitoring, security, and valuation support, Oliver said.
 Recently, Hello Tractor also entered into a technology partnership with the US. based CalAmp as well as India-based Aeris. This particular partnership would see CalAmp  through Hello Tractor  equip [the] John Deere tractors with intelligent telematics and wireless connectivity.
  CalAmp, a technology solutions pioneer transforming the global connected economy, announced that it is partnering with Hello Tractor and Aeris to equip John Deere tractors with intelligent telematics and wireless connectivity, wrote CalAmp in a press release.
 
 The partnership and [the] combined integrated Internet of Things (IoT) technologies create an Uber for tractors that enables an on-demand mechanized equipment service for small farmers in Nigeria and other developing areas to improve economic advancement.
 
 The public-private partnership between Hello Tractor, John Deere, and the Nigerian government has particular deliverables. Yet, CalAmp also believes that their technology partnership will enhance this.
 The end goal of the partnership is to see that more land is put into production which in the end should create more jobs.
 The partnership creates a technology-sharing ecosystem that promotes economic growth by putting more land into production and creating jobs across the region, reads part of the press release.
 When the 10,000 tractors are deployed, it is anticipated that 9 million hectares of land will be put into production. Additionally, 37 million metric tons of additional food will be produced and more jobs created.
 More than 2 million direct and indirect jobs [will be created] in Nigeria  all powered by Hello Tractor, CalAmp and Aeris technologies, reads part of the press release.
 Founded in 2014, Hello Tractor started out as both a software and hardware company.
 The company was making three-wheeler tractors that were equipped with its GPS and IoT technology. These it was planning to sell to farmers on loan and each cost $3,500. It’s raised $2 million for this and struck a deal with Nigeria’s central bank, which is guaranteeing 75% of the amount, wrote Fast Company in 2015.

 However, Hello Tractor abandoned this model according to Olivers interview with Forbes.
 When Hello Tractor launched in 2014, our flagship product was an affordable, ultra-low horsepower, two-wheel tractor fitted with our monitoring technology, he said.
 
 We sold these to enterprising farmers or cooperatives, who then accessed our tractor-sharing platform to identify and service additional demand from smallholders. Great in theory? Yes. Great in practice? Not at that time.
 
 Oliver says that they moved away from the model after the Nigerian economy weakened due to the recession a year later.
 Credit markets dried up and depreciation of the local currency effectively doubled the price of our tractors, making it impossible for our customers to finance purchases.
 Before, Hello Tractor was manufacturing their tractors from China and had plans to move the manufacturing to Nigeria. Yet, all this was shelved.
 Perhaps, more importantly, we realized that to make it financially attractive for tractor owners to use our platform, the tractors themselves would need to be able to reach more farmers over a wider distance than was feasible for our existing product.
 In January 2017, they finally made the strategic decision to focus more on the app than on the tractors.
 Olivier says that this has proved a more effective model enabling them to capture 75% of private commercial tractor inflows to Nigeria, expand to five markets across Africa through strategic partnerships, and touch the lives of 250,000 farmers.
 When you look at it from the point of scalability as well as eliminating overheads, then the partnership with John Deere makes sense.
 Hello Tractor and John Deere have been talking from as far as 2015 though. And according to the Washington Post, Hello Tractor might launch the same initiative in Kenya.
 Currently, Oliver  a 2015 Echoing Green fellow, is based in Abuja, Nigeria though part of his team is based in the USA.

"BICU should transform Up Accelerate into the standard accelerator to build sustainable startups in Uganda
","Yesterday, I paid a visit to Richard Zulu, head of Business Innovation Consortium Uganda (BICU) at Outbox on Lumumba Avenue. It was abrupt and actually didnt expect it to last more than 15 minutes. I was surprised to see us still talking one and a half hours later. What kept us going, for this long? You may be wondering.
 I have respect for all the people that came into this ecosystem early (before me). Though, Richard and a few others like TMS Ruge are in a different category. While as others fell off the wagon, they are still soldiering on.
 Last year (around March), before starting SDA, i approached Richard looking for a story about the Up Accelerate. At that time, he was confident that PC Tech Magazine, Disrupt Africa plus a couple of others were doing a sufficient job to tell our startup story. I disagreed and thought otherwise.
 Slightly over 10 months later (call it yesterday), we met and he asked me what we have been able to do differently to achieve this traction in the market. I told him two things; focus and making an effort to create the content from scratch as opposed to sitting back and waiting for press releases. Talking about FOCUS, I informed him that I had to quit my job last year in July to gamble on Startup Digest Africa full time  a startup 5 months old at that time.
 Still, about focus, he decried the divided attention amongst Ugandan startup founders. At any one point, he said, people are working on more than one thing. Which spreads them thin and their little or no available resources.
 And, talking about creating content from scratch; the reason I had visited Richard was to conduct an interview about BICU.  Because we value raw content more.
 In case you dont know what BICU is, it is Business Innovation Consortium Uganda, in full. An organization of startup hubs, incubators and accelerators that are focused on supporting and enabling entrepreneurship in Uganda.
 This is one organization I feel many should know about  especially those looking to startup or support startups.  Yet, very few know it exists. Even among those that do, few know it was started 5 years ago and Richard is currently heading it.
 Initially, BICU was comprised of Outbox, Hive Colab, Mobile Monday Kampala, FinAfrica, Grameen Foundation Lab, Makerere University Innovation Lab, Mara Launchpad and The Hub Kampala (Now Design Hub Kampala). Many of the hubs there fell off, a few persevered.
 According to Richard, one of the reasons BICU exists is to enforce certain standards in the ecosystem. Something I completely understand and fully support. Without a standard, we shall fall for anything.
 But, when he spoke about enforcing standards as one of their mandates as well as lack of focus among startup founders as one of the challenges they are facing, I felt compelled to suggest that the association adopts a system that new startup founders (have to) go through.
 Currently, we have a lot of startup founders focused on coding (or doing other activities that are urgent but not important) while ignoring getting their hands dirty by going out to the field and talk to the customers. They are applying that old adage of if you build it, theyll come. Which is entirely wrong (at least in my point of view).
 Things in the startup world change so fast that what you thought was the truth yesterday becomes wrong in split seconds. Similarly, you could be building a product today that you think customers wanted yesterday. Only to find out later that, actually, its obsolete. The customer moved on. Yet, if you keep close to that customer and interact constantly, youre likely to minimize the time lapse between realizing that and doing the pivot or tweak.
 However, this is something whose significance many of the startup founders may not understand or appreciate simply because theres no standard way of ushering them into the Ugandan startup space. We need to treat startup founders differently from entrepreneurs. Though, currently, we mistake the two.
 Quoting Paul Graham (PG), a co-founder of startup accelerator and seed capital firm Y Combinator, a startup is a company designed to grow fast. He also continues to argue that being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Many people mistake starting up with a startup.
 
 The only essential thing [about a startup] is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.  PG.
 
 But, people building these startups lack majority (if not all) of the skills they are required to build a startup if youre to go by PGs definition. So, what are we going to do?
 One element necessary in building a thriving startup ecosystem that we need to start appreciating, yet missing in the Ugandan one, is the significance of an accelerator program. It helps bring up to speed the newly enthusiastic and passionate startup founders by allowing them to tap into the experience and expertize of those that have come before them.
 Notably, it also helps avoid frauds from the start. Because, being an accelerator  something designed to take you at a ridiculously high speed  it can help us easily identify people who have the traits of becoming startup founders and those who dont.
 My simple logic is that those who dont will sink and those who do will swim. Then, we just pick up those swimming and train/teach them how to now swim faster and longer. Wont it help both parties save time? Those who wont make it will be able to realize that this isnt their calling, too.
 As it is currently, one has to go to Nairobi, Cape Town, Lagos, Europe or the U.S. in order to have access to an accelerator program. Which is not bad. But, how many people can be able to gain access to those? Not forgetting that people that are giving startups a shot here are so poor at almost everything  including the basics like taking personal initiative, research (reading) or communication.
 Actually, it is not that they are poor because of their fault  it is the education system they were indoctrinated in. Which means that we lose many good people that perhaps would have become great startup founders. Just because the system didnt give them the basics and traits necessary to survive as a startup founder.
 But, if we are to run our own accelerator, then our curriculum can be developed to include some of these elements that our education system isnt.
 In other words, the accelerator would be an extension of the education system but designed to bring (future) startup founders up to speed with the startup world.
 I dont think someone in Berlin or Silicon Valley whose education system teaches them to do thorough research would come up with a curriculum to cater for a Ugandan whose education system didnt teach them to do research.
 Plus, applying for an accelerator outside Uganda exposes one to a lot of competition. Which is a good and bad thing. Good thing because it implies that one has to up their standards. But, bad because many good people (that can ultimately become great with a little guidance and push) miss out.
 Lastly, an accelerator would give us uniformity and identity. This, in the end, will ease engagement with investors and other stakeholders. An investor will know that a startup from Uganda is likely to be at this stage.
 Take an example of Y Combinator. Any investor going to the Y Combinator Demo day knows the bare minimum to expect from them. One being that, I again quote PG, a startup with a good growth rate during YC is at 5-7% a week.
 So, after all this running in my head during our conversation  actually, in a split second  I turned to Richard and asked him whether Up Accelerate will be coming back this year. In case you dont know what it is, Up Accelerate is  in simple terms  an accelerator program for (sexual reproductive) health startups.
 He said, yes.
 My proposal to him was that this  given its already taking place  should be scaled beyond health. To accommodate startups in Fintech, AgTech, MediaTech, InsurTech and other areas. They would remain different programs with different sponsors (and perhaps implementors in form of hubs) but the same goal  to accelerate Ugandan startups.
 I believe BICU should be the body to take this up (and not a single hub or incubator) because then we are able to enforce an industry standard. Which is one of the mandates of the body, not so?
 Malinz (Peter Kisadha) is the founder and CEO of Startup Digest Africa. Let me know what you think about this suggestion. Send to malinz@digestafrica.com.

"Safaricom&#8217;s Masoko venturing into delivery of fruits and vegetables
","Masoko, Safaricoms e-commerce portal, is set to venture into the whole food business with Masoko Fresh. That is according to Safaricom CEO, Bob Collymore. He said this on Friday [07/09/2018] last week at a press briefing after the companys annual general meeting.
 According to Kenyan Wall Street, Masoko Fresh is among the companys future plans.
 Masoko has been offering electronics, beauty products, food and drinks among others. But through Masoko Fresh, they will support the delivery of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. They are looking to onboard small vendors for the initiative and are partnering with Beyond Fresh.
 Masoko, launched in November last year, is one of the ways the telecom is leveraging its market leader position and M-Pesa.
 To date, Masoko says that they have delivered to 45 out of 47 counties in Kenya. The only places we haven’t received orders from are Samburu and Marsabit. For now,” Sharon Holi, the Head of E-commerce at Safaricom, says.
 Masoko, according to their own research, said that market penetration of e-commerce in Kenya doubled between 2016 and 2017.
 This move puts Masoko into direct competition with Jumia Fresh which Jumia launched in May this year.
 Among its future plans, Safaricom is also targeting 20 million farmers in Kenya through Digifarm. So far, the company has signed up at least one million farmers who can now access funds and inputs.
 In October 2017, Safaricom launched an incubator named Alpha. The incubators priority is to identify spending patterns on mPesa and turn those insights into additional Safaricom products. That is according to Chief Innovation Officer, Kamal Bhattacharya.
 Masoko, DigiFarm, Bonga, music streaming app, Songa, and ride-hailing company, Little, are among the products Safaricom has churned out so far.

 Safaricom also launched an investing arm called Spark Venture Fund, worth $1 million. Through the fund, the company participated in mSurveys $3.5 million Series A led by TLcom earlier this year. The company has also backed FarmDrive, Sendy and more through the fund.

"Afrobytes is set to hold events across 7 cities throughout 2019
","The past 5 years have seen an upward trend in events focused on tech and startups across Africa. Yet, Afrobytes, one of them, is becoming a notable annual must-attend. Especially to catch up with happenings across Africa’s tech startup ecosystem.
 Started in 2016, the event has gone through a significant evolution, with the introduction of a Hong Kong tour earlier this year. Yet, according to Ammin, they are looking to take things up a notch up.
 The event’s founders, Ammin Youssouf (CEO) and Haweya Mohamed (MD &amp; Head of Communications), who were recently named among “The 50 Most Daring Entrepreneurs in 2018” by Entrepreneur, want it to become a global link to Africa’s tech.
 A marketplace, as Ammin refers to it, Afrobytes’ ultimate goal is to create meaningful synergies for its attendants. Adding to that description, Ammin further calls it an API.
 “We invite you to plug in with what we do to create more value [for you],” he pointed out. Currently, the focus is on helping startups with securing funding, partnerships and exposure.
 In the past, the event has attracted representatives from a couple of big names. With the notables being LVMH, Facebook and Google.
 By having such people at the event, Ammin believes that they are making it easier for founders to kick-start conversations with them. “We are always trying to integrate new people into Africa’s tech ecosystem,” he pointed out.
 To date, over 400 startups have attended and benefited. Though, the outstanding beneficiary is CoinAfrique  a classifieds startup in West Africa. The startup closed over $3 million in funding early this year, after making an appearance at Afrobytes 2017. “We helped them connect to their investors,” Ammin said.
 Another company, that he declined to disclose, signed a partnership with Kenyan telecom, Safaricom. The two met at Afrobytes last year.
 But, not everyone can make it to Paris, where the main event takes place. Hence the move to decentralize through a couple of satellite events.
 Also read: Godel wants to fix Uganda’s broken last mile delivery system
 Starting December, they will hold events across North America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
 The cities that they have mapped out and the dates are; London (Dec/2018), New York (Jan/2019), San Francisco (Jan/2019), Hong Kong (Feb/2019), Nairobi (March/2019) and Addis Ababa (April/2019).
 While the main event will still take place in Paris with the dates yet to be communicated.
 At all the events, the same topics of Blockchain and AI will be discussed. Though, in the context of their applicability to sectors like agriculture, logistics, education, finance etc.
 Ammin believes that the AI and Blockchain have to be given priority. Otherwise, Africa will lag behind.
 “Google is coming, Facebook is coming, Alibaba is coming,” he said, “the [technology] ‘war’ is coming and we can’t compete with bows and arrows.” His goal, thus, is to get as many Africans ready for that competition as possible.
 Beyond the events, Ammin and Haweya, both French citizens who originate from Comoros and Somalia, have bigger plans for the African tech ecosystem. One of them is launching a fund.
 “In the future, we are looking to evolve into a fund,” Ammin said. Adding that they “are still at the early stages of that.”
 Other than money, the fund  according to Ammin  should be able to provide world-class support to the entrepreneurs they will invest in.
 Although they will be based in France, he says that it would be better than one getting into an incubator or accelerator in the US. Starting with the difference in time zones.
 “The founder has to travel to the West Coast,” he points out, “how do you manage your team from the West Coast? Operationally speaking, it is very difficult!”

"Andela must be expanding to Egypt with this recent job announcement
","Yesterday, Andela announced a call for applications for Senior Developers in Cairo, Egypt. Giving me a reason to believe the company is officially setting up Andela Egypt.
 Andela is launching recruitment for Senior Developers in Cairo as we continue to invest in building an elite, pan-African tech workforce, the company wrote.
 If you have followed the companys expansion across the continent, Senior Developers are usually the first group it recruits. Plus, Jeremy Johnson, the company CEO, explained the role of Senior Developers at Andela in this blog post.
 But, basically, these are usually tasked with training and mentoring the junior developers.
 Also read: This is the AI company that South African law-firm, Bowmans, recently invested in
 The role requires that one is passionate about guidance and mentorship to more junior developers. Because a senior developer is required to serve as a mentor and technical resource to Andela developers outside of your team.
 
 Senior Developers serve as team leads for Andela’s partner companies around the world, and they’re critical to Andela’s mission of investing in Africa’s most talented software developers to power the continent’s digital revolution.
 
 The company has listed a couple of reasons justifying the expansion to Cairo, Egypt. One of them is the talent pool, the ICT growth potential as well as the ease when it comes to hiring that talent.
 Over the past year, we visited and analyzed several different markets around Africa. With a competitive technical talent pool, a commitment to ICT growth, and operational simplicity of hiring in the country, Cairo was a clear frontrunner.
 Last week, I reported that Andela was going to Rwanda. Yet, that and Egypt seem not to be the only country they are headed to.
 The company has been looking for senior developers since the year began. That is in Ghana and Cameroon.
 In fact, Andela says that they currently have senior developers in Kampala, Accra, Nairobi, Cameroon, and Lagos.
 Definitely, the company must be looking to expand to Rwanda, Ghana, Cameroon, and Egypt. As well as a good number of cities across Africa as one of the people that seems to be familiar with the matter, told me.

"Startup of the Week: Kawowo Sports &#8211; All local sports in one place!
","Kawowo Sports is East Africas biggest local sports platform. East African, specifically Ugandan, athletes barely get media exposure to showcase their talent. Mainstream media puts a focus on foreign athletes who are already household names. Inadequate media buzz hampers sports development as corporate companies are not enticed to invest in local sports.
 Kawowo Sports set out to address this dearth in local sports content by focusing on local athletes. They use their website and social media platforms as a vehicle to raise the profile of local sports and with these, they celebrate and promote indigenous athletes, offering them exposure and helping them to attract financial support.
 It is a division of Owino Solutions Ltd (OSL), a web and media company founded in 2008 as an IT firm, therefore Kawowo Sports is funded by OSL.
 One of the successes the startup points to is the fact that it has been operating for over 5 years and in that period, theyve rejuvenated interest in local sports through their comprehensive coverage. They are continuing to break new grounds that have seen them cover Ugandan teams at AFCON 2017 in Gabon and followed local athletes participating in Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia and throughout East Africa.
 The team that leads Kawowo Sports is comprised of Franklin Kaweru, assisted by Edgar Kazibwe plus other hard working writers and photojournalists. These include: David Isabirye, Ismael Kiyonga, Marion Malinga, John Emanzi Ndyamuhaki, Sharifah Namagoba, Denis Musali, Aisha Nakato, Aminah Babirye and John Batanudde. This core team is supported by another that handles analysis, graphics and logistics. These are Eric Ssewankambo, Ruth Owino and Francis Kiggundu
 Asked about the challenges theyre currently facing, Joseph Owino, the founder of OSL, highlighted the really expensive Internet in Uganda! He further stressed that data costs make it hard for them to have all their staff connected and ready to send updates from several sports venues. They also have a funding shortage that makes it hard for them to go all out and hire a strong team that can meet the demands of their content consumers.
 One of their targets currently is to hit one million monthly unique visitors within the next eighteen months.

 It turns out a section of the team that brought YozaApp to the market have gone ahead to work on a new and exciting product. That is YozaPay. They are calling it a very easy way for businesses to collect their payments.
 The team, from YozaApp working on YozaPay, are Nicholas Kamanzi, Jeddy Genrwot and Isaac Kyuka (according to the YozaPay F6S profile).
 When we contacted Nicholas prior to writing this article, he declined to give any comments and instead advised us to get back to them after some time or as he put it in a WhatsApp message;
 
 Please allow us to get some traction. I have your [Malinz] number. I will let you know respectfully  Nicholas Kamanzi
 
 However, we went ahead and contacted Siras Saava, a cashier at Valhalla who is in-charge of managing the YozaPay system. He was able to run us through how the app works.
 What is actually interesting is that its a B2C tool but only businesses download the app  customers dont. And this is a plus in an era where people are just fed up with having to download an app for almost everything.
 
 We have used it for one and a half weeks. On average, we get 35-50 people using this service for a weekend  Siras
 
 I mean, imagine having an App for food, laundry, events, shopping, hotel booking  and again paying for a beer? It sucks, doesnt it! So if you were fed up with Apps, you have a reason to rejoice!
 Yoza Pay is a three steps payment mode. All a business has to do is input the customers number, the amount theyre to pay and a voucher number of their own choice. Once they press OK, it will then prompt the customer to input their mobile money pin code as a sign of acceptance. And as youve guessed, the payment will be done!
 The business using YozaPay then waits for someone from YozaPay to come back with their revenue after an agreed period of time. It could be a week, two weeks or a month. To ensure theres no confusion or any misunderstandings, theres an inbuilt system that generates a statement for the business owner up-on request.
 The interface for billing on YozaPay
 However, the YozaPay team needs to prepare a more detailed and comprehensive way to use while training businesses on how to use the app. This is because Siras wasnt sure of some of the elements of the app like generating a statement.
 So far only MTN subscribers can use YozaPay but were pretty sure itll be rolled out to other operators like Airtel. But for now, who cares about the other operators when you have the market leader in your pocket?
 We only know of Valhalla of their clients but we suspect the number to be around 3. Plus, we can confirm that the YozaPay team is likely to bring Jumia Food Uganda on board after a meeting they held with Ron Kawamara, MD of Jumia Food Uganda, together with the Jumia Group Uganda finance team. Of course getting Jumia food on-board will be a big plus for YozaPay.
 The fintech climate in Africa has been growing at an exponential rate and YozaPay is the latest addition to hundreds of fintech startups across the continent. However, it is not only the number of startups thats growing, the funding too is.

"Between Uber Chap Chap and UberEATS, which one will launch in Uganda first?
","
 Uber recently launched a new service in Nairobi called Uber Chap Chap. Chap Chap is a Swahili slang meaning hurry hurry.
 
 
  
 
 
 They started testing the service in January 2018. If successful, it will then get launched in Uganda and Tanzania. The East Africa general manager Loic Amado told Reuters. Uber Chap Chap is currently available in a few selected areas of Nairobi.
 
 
  
 
 
 The fuel-efficient service will use sedans secured through a deal with CMC motors. A car dealership with a presence in Kenya and Uganda. Under the partnership, Uber secured 300 Suzuki Altos. 
 
 
  
 
 
 It then offered these sedans to its highly rated drivers on the platform. Though with financing from Stanbic Bank Kenya. This will allow the drivers to own the cars after three years.
 
 
  
 
 
 The smallest cost for a Chap Chap ride on the service is 3,600 Ugandan shillings (about 99 US.Cents). Which is more affordable compared to 5,328 shillings ($1.48) for UberX. 
 
 
  
 
 
 In Uganda, Taxify, Quick Taxi and Friendship Taxi offer affordable rates like UberX. But with Chap Chap, the company will have a new dimension to compete.
 
 
  
 
 
 By the same author: Will WhatsApp Pay affect Mobile Money?
 
 
  
 
 
 Uber Eats is a food delivery service like Jumia Food. So far, it has worked well in Cities like Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town in South Africa. Though, it is already looking to hire a General Manager for its Cairo Office. Plus, theres a rumour it might launch in Kenya later this year.
 
 
  
 
 
 The trend has always been that if a product launches in Kenya, Nigeria or Egypt, it is likely to launch in Uganda. Take examples of UberX, Andela, Jumia and other internet services.
 
 
  
 
 
 So, the Uber Chap Chap piloting in Nairobi will definitely move to Kampala earlier than Uber Eats. This is due to the proximity of the markets. As compared to Uber Eats thats to launch in Egypt as the first African market outside South Africa.
 
 
  
 
 
 Though, it shouldnt go without noting; Uber Chap Chap has left a bad feeling with UberX drivers in Nairobi. They claim that Uber is trying to take them out of business with the introduction of Chap Chap. Which also implies that if the Chap Chap service succeeds, Uber might do away with the UberX.

"Nigeria&#8217;s Paystack closes $8 million Series A from Tencent, Stripe, VISA &#038; YC
","Paystack, a Nigerian payments startup, has announced an $8 million series A it raised from a couple of new and existing investors. This is according to reports by TechCrunch.
 The funding has come from Chinas Tencent, Stripe (which Paystack is cloning), VISA as well as Y Combinator. Both Tencent and YC are some of the existing investors in the startup.
 This investment brings Paystacks total investment raised to date to at least $10 million.
 The initial investment into the startup totaled $120k in March 2016 which came from YC after it was accepted into the accelerators early 2016 batch. This was followed by an undisclosed non-equity investment in mid-2016.
 In December 2016, Paystack secured $1.3 million Seed round from a group of investors led by Comcast Ventures as well as Singularity Investments.
 The other investors included Tencent Holdings, Spark, M&amp;S Partners, Tokyo Founders Fund,  Blue Rinc Capital, Pave Investments, KIBS-CFY Partners, Michael Siebel, Justin Kan, Olumide Soyombo, Leonard Stiegeler and a number of Angels.
 The startup also raised a non-equity $50,000 last year from participating in Google Launchpad accelerator.

 According to TechCrunch, the startup is looking to use the funds to expand into new markets with Ghana being top of their radar.
 Founded in 2015 by Ezra Olubi (CTO) and Shola Akinlade (CEO), Paystack is headquartered in Lagos with offices in San Francisco. It lets businesses accept payments via credit card, debit card, money transfer and mobile money on their websites or mobile apps.
 In June this year, the startup pointed out that it had grown 10x in 2017 and was handling nearly $10 million in monthly transactions.
 It also secured a partnership with Truecaller in July to to enable more African businesses [to] accept online payments.
 The partnership will also provide powerful tools that businesses and startups across Africa can use to verify the mobile identity of their customers, and in turn, further help in creating more trust in the online payments landscape on the continent, wrote The Guardian Nigeria.

"DHL and Ethiopian Airlines partner to form a joint venture company
","Logistics company DHL Global Forwarding and Ethiopian Airlines have signed an agreement to form a joint venture company Cargo Logistics provider in DHL-Ethiopian Airlines Logistics Services Ltd.
 The joint venture deal will see DHL use Ethiopian Airline’s network to deliver its cargo, states a release from the Ethiopian Embassy.
 Ethiopian will take a 51% stake and provide the regulatory as well as operational support. While DHL, with 47%, will establish air, ocean and road connections between the country’s main trade hubs and the rest of the world.

 Ethiopian Cargo currently boasts eight dedicated cargo aircraft. These are six B777-200 and two B757-200 freighters, with expectations to receive two more B777 freighters worth $615.4 million. It has a daily uplift capacity of more than 8,500 tonnes.
 
 
 Mid last year, it opened up a new cargo terminal at its Bole airport hub in Addis Ababa to handle 600,000 tonnes. This was an upgrade to the existing terminal which can handle 400,000 tonnes. This raises its handling capacity to over one million tonnes.
 
 
 The new company will be based in Ethiopia and carry out business all over Africa. This will enhance Ethiopia’s logistics infrastructure and connections.
 Additionally, this will also offer DHL a bigger share of the last-mile delivery services from the hubs and cities that Ethiopian Airlines operates in.
 However, another boost that this will have is building cross-border e-commerce logistics across the continent and the rest of the world.
 When you combine DHLs last mile expertize and Ethiopian aviations, then startups may not have to worry about how they will reach customers in markets where they may not have logistics partners or not fully set up.

"Uganda&#8217;s SafeBoda Is Finalizing Expansion To Third East African Country
","SafeBoda  a Uganda-based bike-hailing startup  is among the continents promising startups going by their expansion and driver growth metrics. Though it describes itself as venture-backed, it is not clear how much SafeBoda has raised to date because the startup has been extremely secretive about its fundraising. Though, per our estimates, the amount is within the range of $1.5 million to $2 million.
 Last year, we reported that the startup had raised $1.1 million in funding from a group of investors including Johannesburg-based CRE Venture Capital. According to CB Insights, Singapore-based BEENEXT also participated in that particular round before going ahead to add them an undisclosed post-Seed investment in August 2018.
 Since then, SafeBoda has been on a rampage to deploy the funds through a couple of different initiatives. In September 2018, the startup unveiled its Training Academy in Kampala, Uganda with the aim of professionalising the boda-boda industry.
 However, two months earlier in July 2018, they had also finalised expansion to neighbouring Kenya with a launch in the capital Nairobi. SafeBoda also went ahead and hired a team of around eight software engineers based in the Spanish City of Barcelona.
 It has been reported that SafeBoda was considering expansion to several other African countries including Nigeria. Though, to date, according to the startup, they only have operations across Kampala, Nairobi, and Barcelona.
 Also read: Two of Africa’s leading boda-hailing startups are backed by the same investor
 According to a recent job position posted by one of the startups co-founders, Alastair Sussock, in a closed forum, SafeBoda is expanding to Tanzania.
 The particular job position states that they are looking for a Head of Operations to kick-start their activities in the East African country immediately. Alastair also pointed out that they are also looking for a Country Head at the same, though there were no details regarding that job position. [We reached out to Alastair for a comment, but we are yet to hear from him].
 We reached out to some people familiar with the Tanzanian tech-ecosystem, and all said that they hadnt seen any SafeBodas in Dar es Salaam. But, like many companies or startups that expand across Africa, the target is usually the capital cities. Therefore, SafeBoda will likely kick-start their operations in Tanzanias capital, Dar es Salaam.
 In Uganda, SafeBoda enjoyed a first movers advantage, the expansion to Tanzania will be met with stiff competition from existing players especially Uber with its Uber Poa service for Tuk Tuks as well as Taxify which also operates a boda-boda service. There are also other local players in the market, though  according to someone familiar with the market  they are mostly insignificant and are kind [of] struggling.
 Unlike Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, Tanzania has a wide-spread of Tuk Tuks as a means of transportation  which is why Uber chose to launch Uber Poa (for Tuk Tuks) instead of Uber Boda. Yet, according to the individuals that we spoke to, boda-bodas are starting to take off. I cant say scientifically using data and facts, but from my observation, people use more boda-boda, one of them said.
 SafeBoda is looking at potentially offering both boda-boda and tuk-tuk services according to a section in the job description. The Operations team are at the heart of SafeBoda and are responsible for ensuring SafeBoda rapidly grows its boda driver and potentially bajaji/tuk-tuk community, the part reads.
 The Tanzanian market has been known for being hostile especially to foreign companies and investors.
 In September 2018, it was reported that the Tanzanian government denied Sylvia Mulinge a work permit. Vodacom, one of Tanzanias leading telecom companies, was looking to hire Sylvia as its CEO effective June 1, 2018. In 2017, Aliko Dangote was also reported to have criticized the Tanzanian President John Magufuli of implementing policies that are unfriendly to foreign investors.
 There are also a couple of other challenges that might await SafeBoda in its expansion including road regulations and policies. They will need to lobby with authority for some things to happen, one of the individuals advised.

"Nigeria&#8217;s early-stage fund Microtraction announces second investment this week
","Microtraction, a Nigerian early-stage fund, has announced an investment it made in Allpro. We are excited to announce @microtraction’s investment in Allpro, tweeted Yele Bademosi, Microtractions founder, and current Managing Director.
 Allpro is building the future of school management and financing on the continent, he added, because the Education sector in Africa has the highest number of SMEs and is chronically underfunded.
 According to Yele, Allpro is an end-to-end lending platform for schools in Africa making education affordable and credit accessible for schools, parents, and teachers.
 The startup was founded by Henry Nnalue who currently serves as the CEO as well as Angela Essien as the COO.
 Currently, Allpro is in 30+ schools, with a waiting list of over 90 schools. Additionally, they have processed $1.4m in fee payments and have north of 12,000 students on the platform.
 
 We are amazingly pumped to be a part of this journey with Henry, Angela &amp; the rest of the Allpro team #BuildOurFuture
 — Yele Bademosi (@YeleBademosi) August 15, 2018
 The investment in Allpro is the second Microtraction is announcing this week after the one of Wallet.ng. Though, Yele promised to announce another before this week ends.
 Overall, once the third investment is announced, the total of Microtractions investments  to date and this year  will come to 5. That is Cowrywise, Bitkoin, Wallet.ng, Allpro as well as the one he will announce.
 However, the fund isnt divulging any details regarding how much and the terms of the investments.
 Though, when launching the fund last year, Yele hinted at the fact that they would be investing around $65,000 in early-stage startups.
 Initially it will offer startups US$15,000 for a 7.5 percent equity stake, followed by an additional US$50,000 convertible note at a US$1 million valuation cap in companies that show significant progress, wrote Disrupt Africa last year.
 But, a lot of changes happen along the way when running a venture or a fund. Therefore, theres no guarantee that Microtraction hasnt adjusted the terms from what they thought they would do last year.

"This is how Matibabu has evolved since its founding 5 years ago
","Last month, Matibabu was crowned the winner of Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation. This was accompanied with a $33,000 cash prize and massive media coverage from traditional international media houses like BBC.
 This wasnt Matibabus first time. The startup, thanks to the uniqueness of its solution, has been featured in a couple of western international media. Check here and here.
 But, lets trace the roots to the startup that was started five years ago and seems to be going strong.
 Also read: Alvin Kabwama talks about his Experience in Silicon Valley and Why Innovating in Health isn’t for the Get-Rich-Quick
 The start: 2013
 The Matibabu team first came together in 2013 according to Moris Atwine, who is part of the Matibabu team. At that time, they called themselves Team Code 8 and their product Matibabu. They were six people at the point of the start and are still holding their respective positions to date.
 Since the start, Matibabu has been centered around 6 individuals, and all handling the same positions as Day One, Moris wrote. This includes Moris Atwine, Brian Gitta, Josiah Kavuma, Simon Lubambo, and Shafik Ssekitto.
 That very year, they went ahead and won Microsofts Imagine Cup. The Key achievements in 2013, was winning the ImagineCup National finals to further bringing the UN Empowerment Award at the World Finals, Moris said. This came along with 12,000 USD.
 That same year, Matibabu managed to become the winners of another competition. We managed to become the winners TechCon 2013, USAIDs Higher Education Student Network Global Contest, Moris wrote.
 The year essentially kicked off a plethora of competitions and awards that they have won over time.
 The unending journey of iterations: 2014  2015
 In 2014, the Matibabu team started focusing on coming up with prototypes. They had no idea that they were kicking off an unending loop of prototyping. Important to note is that the events in this period happened co-currently sometimes in the period between 2014 and 2015.
 Also read: Learn more about the 5 tech startup investments by EWB Ventures in Africa
 In the first generation of prototyping, we were trying to understand how light can easily penetrate red blood cells, Moris says. But, there was a lot of interference to this prototype that they had to revisit it.
 There was a lot of external interference which led us to our second prototype where we addressed the issue of external interference, Moris says. Though this also had its shortcomings as  there were no conclusive results.
 This meant that they had to quickly move onto another prototype to address the shortcomings of the second.
 We then moved onto the third generational prototype where we re-engineered the pulse oximeter because we found out that oxygen as a parameter promotes liver-stage malaria infection.
 The efficiency levels of the third generational prototype were quite high with a sensitivity of 60% but the specificity was still low.
 In this same period, Matibabu was selected among the very first startups to be incubated at the Kololo located ResilientAfrica Network  RAN.
 Also read: ResilientAfrica Network Is Not Closing, We Did Not Receive all the $25 Million – Dr. Mayega
 Moris says that this this partnership created a strategic platform for the team and they managed to get introductions to new partnerships and heavily supported our development process.
 Time to accelerate: 2016
 Matibabu spent the bulk of 2016 in acceleration. The startup was accepted in Merck Accelerator, making it the first from Africa to have ever participated.
 In 2016, we were honored to be the first African startup to make it to the Merck Accelerator, Moris wrote.
 This helped us build capacity within the team to know more about structuring a company, legal processes of medical devices and gave the team access to the labs to do more trials with malaria experts.
 They also managed to get get mentors that helped us take big strides towards the new developments.
 In the same year, they were accepted into Kenyas Villgro accelerator where two Ugandan startups  MamaOpe and ClinicPesa  were recently accepted. Moris says that Villgro is heavily focused on business development and investment readiness.
 This has also helped us tap into Villgro’s networks where we have managed to get a few technical experts and VC’s as we investigate possible partnerships.
 More awards: 2017
 The startup got an extra award and once again was featured on an international stage. Last year, Matibabu was awarded the Aspirin Social Innovation Award by the Bayer Foundation.
 The award recognizes social change-makers in the world. Or as Moris described it; people with new answers for the challenges of society in areas connected to health and nutrition with international scope.
 They had kicked off 2017 with a presence at the CES courtesy of TechCrunch. In Jan 2017, we qualified for TechCrunch’s Hardware Battlefield, Moris pointed out. They went ahead and exhibited at CES under TechCrunch’s stall becoming Uganda’s first Startup to ever exhibit at the CES.
 There is another award that the startup won last year together with two other startups. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers’ ISHOW award.
 It was also the same year that they applied to the Africa Prize for Engineering and got accepted in.
 The story continues: 2018
 Matibabu, together with four other Ugandan startups, was shortlisted for the Africa Prize for Engineering in November last year. An award they ended up winning last month despite having other noteworthy challengers like SafeMotos.
 The figure wasnt their first to be won or their biggest cash prize yet. But, Moris Atwine told me that winning the prize has opened some doors that they couldnt get into earlier on.
 Commenting about the prize, last year after being nominated, Brian Gitta  the CEO and Co-founder of Matibabu said that the money will help Matibabu run clinical trials and improve the accuracy of its sensors.
 But, before that  in March  it had been crowned the overall winner of the Pitch@Palace Africa 2.0 competition in the UK. It had also been selected to showcase at this years Sankalp Summit in Nairobi.
 A competition solution?
 Despite all the achievements in form of competitions and awards won over the past half a decade, the startup is still in the prototyping phase with no product on the market. This is something that worries many.
 Earlier this year at the Africa Blockchain Conference, Dr. Bitange Ndemo whos currently heading Kenyas Blockchain Taskforce pointed out that Ugandan startups have always won against their Kenyan counterparts in competitions.
 Yet, Michael Niyitegeka, a former IT Lecturer and a director at the newly rebranded Clark University in Kampala, pointed out that Ugandan solutions stop at winning competitions. His concern was that many are driven by the cash prize and not taking the products to market.
 Matibabu, being among the startups that have won the most awards and competitions, definitely comes to mind whenever one makes such a comment.
 Moris says that for them, things are not good at all or will never be good until they go to market.
 They will never be good until we have an MVP, that’s according to me, Moris pointed out. Adding that we are still far away from the Prize (the MVP) but since we know the promise, let’s face the price!
 Another thing is that theres a general lack of funding for startups in health. This is because it takes longer than other innovations to bring any return let alone go to market. Thats perhaps why one has to resort to grants and competitions to survive.
 The challenge with health care is that funding for technology is still concentrated in donors, research and not as much from equity investment because of commercial viability, Dr. Davis Musinguzi told me earlier this year.
 Also read: Meet Dr. Davis Musinguzi and his Passion to digitize the Health Care Industry in Africa
 For Moris and the team, this years focus is continued product development. We are heavily refining the product towards developing a market-ready version, he wrote.
 Currently, they are carrying out clinical trials with Ugandas national referral hospital and hope that by close of the year, they have some significant results.
 
 We are working with Mulago National Referral Hospital to test and validate the reliability of the device used against the current microscopy and rapid diagnostic test methods among malaria patients and shall use the information obtained to refine and further improve the device and eventually roll it out to the market. I cant tell what we shall be able to achieve by the end of this year but lets keep our fingers crossed.
 
 Spread too thin?
 Another challenge Matibabu has to deal with is the team being pulled in different directions.
 For example, Moris Atwine is working on BreastIT, EnStartup and Matibabu at ago. While the same applies to the rest of the team. They each have at least more than one venture they are handling at ago.
 Additionally, theres a burden that comes with taking grants or competition money. Grant money is referred to many as free money but it usually isnt.
 One is usually engulfed in endless reporting that is sometimes vague and unnecessary. On top of that, a startup is required to adjust its KPIs or vision to align with that of the donor or grant issuer. Imagine doing that for every competition, award.
 Moving too slow?
 When I had a conversation with Moris earlier this year, he was also worried about the media attention they have received. He thinks it could be a double-edged sword.
 This is because there are other people that could be cloning their solution. These might move as fast as possible in their respective markets where Malaria is a problem too.
 Case in point is India. Though the solution might not be exactly as Matibabu, it is worth paying attention too. Plus, it could be easier for them to secure funding for the respective prototypes and licenses needed to come to market.

"Jumia Technologies now faces class action lawsuits after securities fraud allegations
","Jumia Technologies AG rode a particularly smooth crest in the first quarter of 2019. The company became the first African company to successfully go public on the New York Stock Exchange. Its share price rose by 70 percent and its quarterly earnings gave investors something to look forward to.
 That crest, however, has come crashing down and locked the African e-commerce giant’s reputation in a riptide.
 Activist short seller Andrew Left, through his Citron Research, released a report claiming that Jumia misled investors as well as authorities before going public. In the report, Left states that Jumia falsified figures relating to active buyers and merchants on the platform.
 Despite denying these allegations during the earnings call, Jumia is now facing securities class action lawsuits from a number of law firms.
 On behalf of investors who lapped up Jumia stock (JMIA), Bragar Eagel &amp; Squire, P.C has filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York. Global investor-rights law firm Rosen Law Firm has also filed a similar suit in order to recover damages for investors who acquired the company’s stock.
 Gainey McKenna &amp; Egleston is also calling on plaintiffs who acquired Jumia shares during the class period; April 12 to May 9 of 2019.
 Generally, the complainants allege that Jumia overstated its merchants and customers. This then warped the numbers surrounding the company’s sales. Per AP News, there are also allegations that Jumia failed to sufficiently disclose related party transactions.
 Furthermore, Jumia allegedly presented financial statements in contravention of the applicable accounting standards.
 During the earnings call on Monday, Sacha Poignonnec, CEO of Jumia, maintained that he didn’t put stock in Mr. Left’s allegations in the Citron Research report.
 “Jumia stands by our prospectus and audited financials and will not be distracted by those who look to create doubt, to profit at our expense and that of our long-term stakeholders,” he said, refusing to be drawn further into the matter.
 It remains to be seen what the official Jumia Technologies stance will be regarding this matter.

"GrowthAfrica partners with Malawi&#8217;s mHub to launch an Accelerator program
","Yesterday [03/05/2018], GrowthAfrica and Malawis mHub launched an accelerator program. With the support of UNDP and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Malawi.
 Dubbed Growth Accelerators, the program aims to support emerging entrepreneurs.
 The program is aimed at startups that are already operational or post-revenue. An area GrowthAfrica has focused on for most of its past programs across East Africa.
 
 The Growth Accelerator program will thus start as an Entrepreneurship Challenge targeting start-up entrepreneurs with an innovative product or service on the market that demonstrates the potential to scale or those looking for investment to take their business to the next level.
 
 The program will last for a year and 10 entrepreneurs will be selected from a pool of applicants. Each will access up to USD 40,000 in financing through a matching grant or a private equity option.
 The Global Accelerator Learning Initiative, GALI, report, released February this year, found that over 25% of ventures rank direct funding as the most important, followed by network and skill-building. Thus, this program could be a stepping stone for many startups in Malawi looking to raise funding.
 Vincent Kumwenda, the CEO of mHub, said that it is important that we create support mechanisms and incentives to make SMEs become investment ready, scale and attain sustainability.
 When GALI, released its report on the status of accelerator program in sub-Saharan Africa, Malawi didnt feature among the top 10 countries. Making the launch of Growth Accelerator timely. (Also see: These are the leading Ugandan accelerator programs).

"5 Things to Know Before You Start Freelancing in Uganda (from Bobi Wine&#8217;s PR Advisor)
","Entrepreneurship in Uganda is on the rise, so is freelancing. Though the two are usually mistaken for each other, it is no doubt that entrepreneurship and freelancing need each other.
 In an environment where entrepreneurs have to bootstrap their startups most of the time, freelancing offers a great source of income to help them do so as well as survive. On the other hand, it also provides the same startups access to professional services like photography, accounting, PR etc without having to hire a full-time employee or contract a firm.
 Thats why we have decided to guide those that may be interested in freelancing on how to go about it in Uganda. We talked to Anne Whitehead, the founder of Whitehead Communications. Anne has been in the freelance world for more than 5 years during which she has been at the helm of advising Bobi Wine on PR related issues as well as other notable clients in Uganda.
 Heres what she recommended that you should know before jumping into the now growing freelancing world.
 
 
 Networking
 
 
 During our conversation, you could tell that Annes entire success in the freelancing world has been mainly due to networking. In her own words, she calls it being friendly and willing to socialize. She also adds the fact that more deals in Uganda are sealed from the bar than the boardroom implying that it is who you know over what you know in most cases.
 Therefore, if youre looking to step into the freelancing world, ensure you turn your networking game on. The networking may not necessarily be for clients only  it also applies to relevant contacts in the industry that can act as mentors and guides.
 For Annes case, she points out Isaac Mulindwa and Simon Kaheru as some of the key contacts that helped her navigate.
 When it comes to networking, it is easy for people to get stuck online by using networking and social media sites because it is more comfortable. However, it is recommended that you go offline and meet such contacts in person. You should also be ready to attend events that can help you.
 2. Patience and perseverance
 When youre just stepping out to freelance, chances are that you have a lot to learn as well as a lot of people to meet. By deciding that youre now freelancing doesnt mean that deals will start coming your way there and then. You need to know that things take time.
 There will be a time lapse between when you jump into that world and when deals start flowing in. You need to know that, and it is ok.
 Anne recommends that one should be ready to work for free sometimes where necessary. In some cases, you should be ready for clients that wont make payments at the agreed times because of difficulties on their end.
 All in all, you should only expect to reap the fruits of freelancing only if youre patient enough. It is not a get rich quick world but one that requires patience and perseverance.
 3. Blogging and Social Media
 Blogging is one of the best ways to market your skills and knowledge in a particular field. Youll be astonished at how much you know that others dont  thats if you are well read and experienced in that field.
 So, why not share it in a simple article of around 500 words? With this, youll start getting a loyal following of people in that industry from which could be your prospects or some that can act as your ambassadors who will refer you to others.

 Anne recalls Simon Kaheru being the person who advised her to start a blog for her company, Whitehead communications.
 On top of blogging, you should be ready to remain not only active on social media but also relevant in your field of choice. Follow people that are key in your niche, answer questions, join groups and engage as much as you can.
 4. Skill sets
 A good proposal can get you a job, but it wont keep it or earn you a recommendation from that clients. It is how well you execute that job.
 Anne, whos into communications and PR, emphasizes that its her skill sets and how she executes her works that amaze the clients. In fact, this is the very first thing you should consider before jumping into the freelance world.
 Just to let you understand how crucial your skill sets are to this part of the world, most of the clients or prospects youll come across will request for your previous works too in order to assess if youre the right man or woman for the job.
 The recommendation from Anne is very simple. Before you even think of freelancing, make sure you have the right skill sets that you need to execute the job.
 5. Flexible and Organized
 When you decide to join the freelancing world, you give up the right to be rigid. This is partly because you have no permanent clients or bosses. Anne adds that one should be able and ready to have meetings or work from anywhere. It could be the clients offices, coffee shops, your bed or bar.
 You should also be ready to be up and down because your clients change and so do their projects, priorities, places and times when and where to execute. So, to perfectly fit into the world, one should be extremely flexible.
 In addition, given that you are likely to juggle more than one clients at a time, you should be more than organized. It helps to make use of tools like the google calendar, google sheets, to-do list apps as well as task manager apps. This will help you avoid being overwhelmed, mixing up clients work, missing appointments and meetings.
 This list is not exhaustive but has some of the crucial things that have helped  and still, do  Anne to perfectly fit into the freelancing world. In case you are considering joining that world, give them a try.

"The Innovation Village to host Kampala Sparks as a build up to Sahara Sparks
","Sahara Sparks is an annual “innovation and technology entrepreneurship event” that takes place in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Started in 2015, the event is becoming an annual must-attend.
 This year, it will happen alongside AfriLabs annual Gathering at Golden Tulip Hotel in Dar es Salaam from the 11th to 13th October 2018.
 To build momentum for the main event, Sahara Sparks has decided to hold “tour” events in nearby cities called City Sparks. This includes Kampala.
 Last week, it announced a partnership with The Innovation Village to hold an event in Kampala called Kampala Sparks. The theme for Kampala Sparks, like Sahara Sparks, is “Innovation in the Data Age.”
 According to Sahara Sparks, “Kampala Sparks aims at building regional innovation ecosystems”.
 Kawanguzi Japheth of The Innovation Village described this as an opportunity to learn locally and regionally.

"Update: Winners of Up Accelerate Cylce II Announced.
","Last week, we reported about the 10 startups in the Sexual Reproductive Health field that had been selected for pitching to a panel of judges in the Up Accelerate program. Today, they did at Outbox Hub and out of these, four finalists emerged as winners. These will pocket $10,000 each.
 The teams that won are m-Scan, Blood Finder, Health Data Harvester and Eco Smart Pads. What is interesting is that one of the winners, Health Data Harvester, was once rejected in the first cycle. This means they went back and refined their product something that startups here rarely do. Congratulations Health Data Harvester.

 We however decided to reach out to one of the startups  m-Scan.  We shall also follow-up with the rest of the teams to ensure we give you a comprehensive understanding of what theyre trying to solve.
 m-Scan is a team of four; Prosper Ahimbisibwe (Clinical Head and Co-founder), Menya Innocent (Team Leader and Radiology Assistant), Kyomuhendo Phyllis (Radiology Coordinator) as well as Nasasira Ivan who is in-charge of information systems.
 According to Prosper, m-Scan is a low cost mobile ultrasound innovation that is aimed at saving lives of pregnant mothers  especially in rural or hard-to-reach areas. This it aims to achieve through early screening of the factors that lead to maternal mortality.

 Tthrough a smartphone combined with a probe, this will be possible. They are targeting health centers, health camps, Government agencies and ministries as well as the World Health Organization. The software will be free of charge but the probe will come at a cost which  currently  is estimated at $600.
 Related: Interview: MamaOpe – Inside BBC Listed African Invention to Look out for 2017
 They believe this is more affordable  compared to what is already in place.When asked about what they expect to get from the Up Accelerate program, Prosper was quick to point out the fact that they still need help when it comes to ensuring the idea makes business sense as well as crafting a marketing strategy. He also believes this is an opportunity for them to work on their much anticipated prototype.
 The only challenge m-Scan has  given it is in the health sector, just like the financial sector  is trust. Professionals and institutions are already attached to certain brands which makes it hard to penetrate the market.

 Secondly, we have had a couple of startups in the health field like Matibabu as well as MamaOpe come and win a series of competitions, but it seems bringing a hardware product to market is far harder than most think  and probably harder in the health sector.
 Uganda has no thriving manufacturing industry  worse for the health sector  hence the only logical way forward is getting a production partner  who has some credibility  either in Asia or Europe.
 What challenges are preventing Ugandan startups  especially in the Health sector  from starting to ship their products? Is it that they require a lot of funding or the absence of a thriving manufacturing sector? Do these ideas only make business sense on paper but have no place in the real world?

"What Causes Side Hustling Among Ugandan Entrepreneurs &#8211; Silicon Hills Kampala
","Last evening, Fenix International hosted some of Ugandas leaders in the tech and startup ecosystem in an event dubbed Silicon Hills Kampala. The main aim was to boil down heads and forge a way forward as well as craft a vision for the ecosystem despite all the looming challenges.
 The program involved a keynote speech from TMS Ruge, the founder, and CEO of RainTree Farms as well as a co-founder at Hive Colab. This was shortly followed by a panel discussion moderated by Jit Bhattacharya, the CTO at Fenix International.
 The panel consisted of Alastair Sussock, Co-founder at SafeBoda, Mary Musimire from Techmakers, Solomon King, Founder of FundiBots and Timothy Musoke, a co-founder at Laboremus.
 The panel was faced with a couple of questions. Some of which have been asked over and over. But, the fact they are repeated at similar or same gatherings is an indication of how important theyre. Yet, it is also an indicator that nothing or little has been done towards solving them.
 We picked out some of the questions that were presented and believe are very crucial. One of them was how (as Uganda) do we continue to develop the talent to ensure the companies have what they need?
 Solomon King was the first to give a go at it and he said that the problem is very deeply ingrained into society and the education system itself. 
 
 Basically, you really need to start from a very early age. Initially, when we [Fundibots] began our program we were working with Secondary school students and we realized that even at that stage we were still having issues. So we decided to go lower to primary school  Solomon King
 
 According to Solomon, we need to start at a very early age. However, this is an urgent issue. This is something that requires going with what is available. If our goal is to build an army of techies for the next 30 years, then Solomons approach can work.
 Yet, if we are aiming at solving a problem that already exists, then we need to go with the Andela way. Start with those that have already expressed interest in tech and coding.
 Secondly, there was a question that was paused by someone off twitter. Basically, the person was looking to understand the general mood on Blockchain and Cloud Technology in Uganda. Despite the fact that Timothy gave an objective answer, it was very narrow in my opinion. Plus, no one on the panel seemed to have an extensive understanding of how far and widely it has penetrated Uganda(ns).
 Plus, no one on the panel seemed to have an extensive understanding of how far and widely the two have penetrated Uganda(ns).
 Third, another crucial question on how co-working spaces and incubators, as well as other elements of the ecosystem, can work together was paused.
 Alastair gave it the first shot and he believes the point of mentorship is very important. His suggestion is that to keep up with the changes around the world, mentorship should be given priority.
 Also read: E.A Incubators Should Push Young Entrepreneurs to Talk to “Real People” – GrowthAfrica CEO
 He also pointed out that one of the challenges people in the coworking spaces face is that they have got a lot of things they are working on at ago. He suggested that mentorship around that needs to be done.
 Solomon Kitumba, the Community Manager at Innovation Village, also added his voice by saying that most of the co-working spaces just have good internet and fancy facilities, nothing more.
 He, however, wondered  out of all those running these co-working spaces  how many actually have the power to make a call to a specific entity. Solomon closed by encouraging everyone to find out a way to craft partnerships that can increase the leverage of these coworking spaces.
 There was also a discussion about crowdfunding as an alternative way of raising startup funding.
 Alastair agreed that they got a very small grant from a crowd funding campaign. It wasnt very complex. It was just something to get us started and also get many people interested in what we were doing. It was very useful for us. People need to think about alternative forms of capital here though.
 Yet Solomon King, from Fundibots, said they tried to do a crowd funding campaign. It did not go well. Ugandans give to the heart. They give to personal causes like a sickness.
 However, Ruge suggested that in order to see a turnaround of events in crowdfunding, we need to dump almost everything foreign about it and customize it to suit our local ways.
 
 Lets crowd fund the way we know how to crowd fund. We have something called the savings SACCOs. Lets take this thing that has been perfected at the community level and apply it to tech startups. Theres an opportunity to innovate around. We shouldnt look at crowd funding platforms that we dont even understand  Ruge
 
 George William, an Assistant Administrator with Laboremus, also added his voice and mentioned the fact that the tech sector elites seem to be detached from what the reality is. His issue was that the internet in Uganda is the number one thing deterring people from innovating. He urged all those concerned to come up and advocate for a reduction in internet costs.
 Maria, the Operations Lead at Andela Uganda, closed the session with a question that  I am disappointed  never received the deserved answers. The majority that tried to answer it all went astray. The solutions that were presented werent digging deep to the core cause of the problem.
 She was responding to the point that Alastair raised  the fact that most Ugandan innovators have more than one thing they are doing at ago. To her, the reason as to why most people have more than one hustle is because the rest are failing or not bringing in money. But they are not doing it out of complacency. In the end, they use oor learn more than one program and skill.
 However, Jit  the moderator, was able to clarify this by bringing in the Silicon Valley comparison. He said, there arent as many side hustles in Silicon Valley because it is an ecosystem that gives entrepreneurs and engineers the opportunity to take longer term risk.
 Theyre not as worried about can I make that money today. Because theres an entire ecosystem there and ready to support. How do we create that ecosystem [here] that allows people to take big risks?  Jit.
 This is true. For an entrepreneur to survive in Uganda, they have to do something that brings in short term income as well as work on their startup or innovation thats aimed at the long term. Unless this issue is addressed to the core, the trend will never change.

"These are the winners of the previous Seedstars Kampala Editions
","Seedstars is returning to Kampala next month. The Seedstars Kampala event will crown the Kampala Innovation Week on August 24. It is also likely to take place at Outbox. Seedstars perennial venue partner.
 Founded in 2012, Seedstars held its first event in Kampala in 2015. And, over the past 3 years, several startups have participated in the competition with three walking away with the prize.
 This has allowed them a trip to Switzerland for the world summit. Unfortunately, none has been fortunate enough to carry the ultimate prize back home.
 I am tracing them to find out how far they have gone ever since they participated in the event.
 Numida
 Numida won last year’s edition of Seedstars Kampala. The lending startup prevailed over 8 other startups. This included Musana Carts, Chap Chap Africa, and ClinicPesa. It went ahead to exhibit at this year’s Seedstars Summit in April.
 Last year, Mina Shahid informed me that the company had raised US $200,000 in funding in September 2007. Part  if not all  of this funding could have come from EWB Ventures. They had also interviewed at Y Combinator in May 2017.

 Earlier this year, the company was selected  together with Patasente, Ensibuuko, and MRP  to take part in Village Capital’s Fintech Africa 2018 program organized in partnership with Paypal.
 The company was registered in Uganda in December 2015 but only commenced operations in March 2016. It basically allows registered users  which are MSMEs  to access loans of $20-$1500.
 Akiba
 Akiba was the second Ugandan startup to qualify for the Seedstars summit after winning the 2016 edition. Headed by Ivan Mworozi, the startup edged other startups including DusuPay and Panya (now called Sellio).
 The startup went ahead to represent Uganda at the 2017 Seedstars Summit in Switzerland.
 Yet, Akiba seems to be no more. Given that the website  www.akiba.co.ug  is no more. Plus, since September 2017, Ivan  one of the co-founders  is now focused on Print Boda. A decentralized shop that “enables you to brand your gifts, business cards or promotional materials online and have them delivered in 24 hours.”
 Intership
 Formerly based at Outbox Hub on Lumumba Avenue, Intership was the first winner of Seedstars Kampala. That is way back in 2015.
 An online shopping platform, Intership edged startups like SafeBoda, the now-defunct Yoza, and RoundBob to secure themselves a ticket to Switzerland for the 2016 Seedstars Summit.
 This year, the e-commerce company was among the 39 startups for the second African cohort of the Alibaba eFounders Initiative. It was among the only three startups from Uganda. Thats online travel agency, RoundBob and fintech startup Xente.

"DusuPay Expands Operations to Rwanda
","DusuPay, a payments gateway for companies accepting payments from Africa, has today extended its operations to Rwanda. This they say is in a bid to become Africas Largest payments solution for all global businesses looking to accept payments from Africa.
 With this move, businesses in Rwanda can now accept payments from all over Africa as well as businesses from all over the world can accept payments and payout to businesses in Rwanda.
 In a conversation with Ntende Kenneth, one of the co-founders of DusuPay, he confirmed that it is true they have expanded and looking forward to bridging the payments gap in Rwanda.
 Kenneth says that they have integrated with MTN mobile money. Now businesses in Uganda, across Africa and the world can accept payments from Rwandese from their MTN mobile money.
 So far, according to Kenneth, DusuPay has seen a lot of usage in the betting space with betting companies like Africabet.com, africabetnow.com, and hollywoodbets.com already actively using them to accept mobile money payments from Rwanda.

 These use them mainly to accept mobile money payments from Rwanda, says Kenneth. After the integration of MTN mobile money, Kenneth also added that they are now looking to soon add other telecoms which will further solidify their position as market leader in how global businesses accept and make payments with Africa.
 This is a very bold and necessary step. The majority of businesses in Africa looking to do business across borders have been subjected to painful and expensive payment modes.
 If one doesnt use bank transfers, theyre subjected to traditional means like the Western Union.
 Lastly, Africa ranks lowest in intra-trade ranking. This part can be attributed to inefficiencies arising when transacting business across the borders.
 With the emergence and expansion of platforms like DusuPay, we sure hope this to be tackled.

"CoinPesa in drive to get more Ugandans into Cryptocurrency trading
","CoinPesa, a Ugandan digital currency exchange has launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) pre-sale with the aim of getting more Ugandans on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. Dubbed the CoinPesa Champion Referral Program, it uses Blockchain technology to create digital assets through tokenization and provides a way for users to generate an actual “tangible” asset and sustainable incomes from their continued usage of the exchange.
 CoinPesa CEO Suleiman Murunga said, “In this digital era, Cryptocurrencies continue to emerge as new forms of investment and payment systems. Online businesses are proliferating globally and cryptocurrency is being used as virtual money to buy and sell items off the Internet.
 As a digital currency exchange, our mission goes beyond just simply providing a point of access for users to access Cryptocurrency. We want to offer a platform that can be used to realize new possibilities, where users can access valuable financial services and uplift themselves through sustainable revenue generation opportunities.”
 The CoinPesa Champion Referral Program is a direct system where users are paid
 a commission for every successful reference into the platform. It has been designed to allow the program participants to build sustainable incomes around their community development activities.
 The ICO-pre sale will give users the ability to purchase the Coinpesa Token (CPXT) which is a utility token that they will use to pay for various services on the platform such as trading fees.
 “We decided to have this program in order to get the community involved and vested in the growth of our platform. We recognize job creation and value addition as key areas of impact for us as an exchange. The region has one of the highest youth unemployment rates. Our program provides a platform for people to get into Cryptocurrency trading to create sustainable working tools for the community that would then help them access revenue channels and improve their livelihoods,” Murunga added.
 Blockchain technology allows digital information to be distributed but not copied thereby creating the backbone of a new type of Internet. This new technology has gained global attention that it has built trust in systems used for the transfer of valuable information such as money and intellectual property.
 Experts believe Blockchain technology can be used in Uganda, to address challenges in the country like authentication of land titles, eradicating the problem of counterfeit drugs entering the country and authenticating of university degrees.
 “Blockchain technology gives us the ability to create digital assets like never before. We believe in a world that will only get more tokenized and almost anything of value will eventually get tokenized. We believe this is an opportunity to create an actual asset that will give users the ability to treat their network like any other valuable asset. They may decide to sell it, use it as collateral or transfer it to their next of kin,” Murunga concluded.
 About CoinPesa
 CoinPesa is a digital currency exchange built for the emerging markets users with a focus on the African market. They are solving the issues users face in the emerging markets while trying to access cryptocurrencies by localizing the product to fit their user’s needs. CoinPesa’s mission is to enhance financial inclusion though blockchain based digital assets.

"SafeBoda completes expansion to Kenya, now live in Nairobi
","After months of anticipation on SafeBoda expanding further than Uganda, it is now certain that the Boda-hailing company is expanding Eastwards. In an announcement made by Alastair Sussock, Co-CEO at SafeBoda, the startups services are now live in Nairobi, Kenya.
 
 In a competitive market that also includes Taxify, Mondo, Dial Jack and UberBODA; SafeBoda has grown to become a force to reckon in the East African boda-hailing market.
 This is evident in the number of riders available, the customer ratings, as well as the reception across the region.
 A quick hint to a Kenyan expansion was visible in a recent update to the SafeBoda app, which includes an M-PESA integration. MPESA is a Safaricom product and widely used across Kenya.
 Also Read: Who’ll eventually win Uganda’s ridesharing market?
 SafeBoda will join Taxify, which has already set a firm stride on the Nairobi-Kenyan soils.
 Arguably the market is increasingly demanding for a safe, organized and reliable boda-boda industry. We are yet to know whether they will maintain their signature orange, with Taxify having changed from Green to Yellow for Nairobi.
 Progression has been the case at Uganda’s pioneer boda-hailing company since the start of the year.
 The company unveiled it’s new offices and logo to the public in March. In April this year, SafeBodas co-founder, Ricky Rapa Thompson, also featured in Forbes 7th annual ranking of the 30 Most Promising Young Entrepreneurs In Africa.
 Recently, a partnership with MTN Uganda was struck to allow riders to use the app with zero data. Though it has been an on and off service for many. Recently, it also experienced a backlash from its users as its services were not able to reach some of its users.
 
 I call @SafeBoda customer care, the ladies are helpful, I ask why is it that I try to request for a rider and I fail for over 20 mins but someone just taps in 2 mins they have one, she politely says its luck keep trying. In this day of Big data? we still leave things to luck?

"Evelyn Namara Points Out 5 Things That Helped Her Build an Award Winning Tech Product in Uganda
","Recently, !nnovate  a company co-founded by Evelyn Namara  won the overall entrepreneur award in the Agriculture sector at this years Women In Africa club Summit in Marrakesh, Morocco.
 This joins the ICT for Development award won at this years Uganda Communication Commissions ACIA Awards in May. And, of course, a couple others won by Evelyn in a personal capacity, but basing on her work at !nnovate.
 In a conversation, she revealed what has enabled !nnovate to stand out.
 
 
 Uniqueness
 
 
 Evelyn points out !nnovates uniqueness as the key and lead factor.
 I think what makes us specifically unique is that were solving a problem that is actually there, Evelyn says.
 Solving a problem thats actually there is fast becoming a differentiating factor between solutions that become successful and those that last for a while.
 The problem !nnovate is solving is demanded, thats why she added that when you have a product that is solving a specific problem, you definitely are going to have the buzz.
 Most startups you find start with the product, then look for the solution or to think whos my customers?' Yet, product development demands that you start by identifying the problem, then work backwards  not the other way round.
 For us, we took some time to step out and understand what people want in the payments sector  especially the unbanked in the agricultural sector, Evelyn pointed out. Adding that once we knew that we just specifically went for the solution.
 2. Past Experience
 Evelyn has been around enough to see the tech and startup scene in Kampala and Africa evolve. She has worked for several companies as well as sought advice and mentorship from many.
 This, she believes has been one of the contributing factors to understanding how to build customer-centric solutions that go along way to captivate peoples attention.
 Well, I think it is through my journey as an entrepreneur. Because I have done Computer science and a few other things in social entrepreneurship, Evelyn Namara on how she is able to build a unique product.
 From Outbox, Startup Weekend and so many other events and mentorship programs, Evelyn believes she has done it all. Which experience has eventually helped her understand and appreciate the process of building a product that solves a real need.
 3. Focusing on the need, not coolness
 While as many people are solely focused on developing solutions for the smartphone, Evelyn suggests that thats not the right way to approach the process of developing tech products.
 We also want to do solutions of smartphones and look cool and were like wow, my app is here and it works like this, Evelyn says.
 But at the end of the day, as Evelyn pointed out, if youre solving a real problem and you know the needs of the people, then you have to give them the solutions that work for them.
 I mean if youre going to work with smallholder farmers and we are saying that we need them to help them, Evelyn noted, then we need to take the most feasible option.
 She advises that one needs to come up with a solution thatll meet the users at the technology level of understanding they are at first.
 4. Previous work experience
 Evelyn pointed out that her previous work experience has been very key in learning the line of business she is in.
 It is very key to learn whatever business youre going to do or whatever product youre trying to work on, Evelyn says.
 You definitely need to know the ins and outs. Who the stakeholders are, who youre going to work with, she added. She gave herself as an example having a background in tech and previous work experience in Social Entrepreneurship.
 She has worked with companies like Beyonic  which does bulk payments. An experience she attributes her knowledge of doing bulk payments with MTN and Airtel to.
 I developed a lot of partnerships and knowing how do you deal with partners like Airtel and MTN if you need to get something from them, Evelyn on the importance of having work experience.
 5. Patience 
 In most cases, Evelyn says, it comes down to patience, yet some people are usually looking for quick results.
 I know so many entrepreneurs that have totally given up on solutions I thought were really really amazing, Evelyn on the importance of patience.
 Rough times are surely going to knock, more than a couple of times. But, Evelyn advises that the solution is not throwing in the towel.
 We have had to be persistent at some point, she recalls. However, it is not enough to have patience, you need to be improving during the process. And, as Evelyn advises, If youve had one customer, how do you get from that one customer to the next customer?
 To also ensure she did not throw in the towel, she surrounded herself with a group of people to help her. Find a network of like-minded people, she advises.
 Put yourself in a position where you can get information everywhere. Therere so many volunteers out there. But if you do not know how to network and get out there, youll never know these people.

  What prompted you to apply to Andela?
 
 I was looking for a challenge. I desired, strongly, to level up my skills. I saw a great opportunity in Andela in working with a diverse group of companies from all over the world. This to me meant unparalleled exposure to new technologies and accessing the latest trends in software development.
 
  What is the most exciting experience youve had at Andela so far?
 
 An application that required me to learn and use Angular2 in 3 weeks, a framework, that I had never interacted with before. It was hectic but I pulled it off. Its gratifying to say that I learnt and built something new in just 3 weeks! 
 
  Where do you see yourself a year from today and how does being part of Andela help you get there? 
 
 One year from now I will be working with Andelas partner clients and I know I will be doing an excellent job. Beyond that, I desire to be a tech entrepreneur and will have a network of 300 developers in Andela to tap into for inspiration and connections. That is a pool of unparalleled talent which I know will work wonders for me in the future.

"What You Should Know Before Launching an E-Commerce Platform in Uganda (from the MD Jumia Food)
","Often times, people approach me asking for guidance on how to go about starting an e-commerce platform. Sad part is they dont even realize it is what theyre asking for  that shows you how bad the situation is. I simply link this to the poor research habits among some of the people here who want to venture into entrepreneurship.
 One of the most recent was a friend who wanted to develop an app that she would use to sell to her customers. According to her, she wanted a Jumia for her products. I sat her down and explained what it actually means to develop and run an e-commerce site effectively  that can become profitable, at that. She left convinced and resorted to setting up a shop as a vendor on Jumia (then Jumia Market).
 The second case was a gentleman who (up-to now) is trying to set up a platform thatll allow his clients to order fresh fruits and vegetables in his words conveniently and cheaply. To him, i just gave my unsolicited advise because i realized that he needed it badly. He was poor at his figures and didnt know exactly where he was headed for.
 These are just some of the few cases of people who want to go into e-commerce just because theyve seen Jumia, Konga, Takealot or Kilimall do it. They think  they too  can do it, and should do it. Which is wrong.
 My working with Jumia has given me great insights into what it means to run an e-commerce site. I think when people hear that Jumia hasnt broken-even yet, probably they think the team is a joke. Let me set the record straight, Jumia has some of the brightest minds across the world. But Africa is just a different piece of cake.
 I therefore decided to just bring to the attention of those who aim to venture into e-commerce what they should expect. I had a quick chat with Ron Kawamara, the Managing Director of Jumia Group in Uganda and Country Manager of Jumia Food Uganda. Ron has been with Jumia since its launch here.
 Are you looking at launching an e-commerce platform in Uganda (or any other Sub-Saharan country), here is what you should keep in mind.
 Mobile Money is Queen, Cash is still King
 When you read about Mobile Money in the media and how it has penetrated the lives of day to day Ugandans, you may think integrating it into your system will make the pain of dealing with payment on delivery go away. False! People here are still addicted to their cash.
 Its true that most Ugandans do use Mobile Money compared to Debit or Credit Cards. However, most people still prefer to use cash for payment on delivery  Ron
 Ron emphasizes that this stems from the fact that customers dont trust. People dont want to pay for something they havent seen yet. However much they know their order will arrive, they want to see it first. He therefore recommends that in order for you to mitigate the issue of trust, allow your end users to have cash as a payment option.
 Personally i have been ordering food on Jumia Food (formerly Hellofood) since 2015 (a couple of times per month) but have never paid using Mobile Money. All my payments are 100% cash on delivery.
 Africa is different, you wont do one thing  but everything
 In already developed countries, an e-commerce platform is purely an e-commerce platform  in Rons words a market place, period. In Africa, thats not the case. If youre to set up something (new), expect to also setup the support structures.
 For example, Ron highlights the fact that some of the restaurants dont even have packaging. This means Jumia Food has to go an extra mile to support them when it comes to acquiring packaging. He also points out the fact that in Uganda theres no formal address system.
 When we opened here, we thought that we were going to be a pure marketplace but that has changed. We spend about 10-15% of our revenue on just delivery. If there was an already established delivery system by restaurants, we would be 10-15% better off  Ron
 This implies that if youre to launch such a service, youll have to get software that can allow you setup your own address system. Youll also find that some of the businesses on your platform cant properly calculate their margins. In the end, it makes it hard for you to be 100% a marketplace.
 In short, these are some of the challenges that youll find. Ron simply recommends that you face reality and adjust. So, what happens if youre a small startup that cant invest in helping your vendors calculate their margins, set-up a formal address system or all the support structures required so that you can run smoothly? It is simple  you go down the drain.
 Strategic Partnerships are not an option, theyre a must
 Trust came up as one of the issues above. Well, it still remains one of the biggest issues as long as you decide to run an e-commerce platform. People wont trust that they can order a laptop from just a website and have it at their door step the next 24hrs. They simply want to enter a shop and walk away with one.
 But how do you circumvent this? Ron recommends that you setup partnerships. Set-up partnerships thatll endorse you.
 Strategic Partnerships are the cheapest and quickest way to break-even. As a startup, you dont have the resources to reach everyone. You also  need credibility as a new player, but its hard to get it. The fact that we work with MTN gives us credibility  Ron
 The second reason why you need strategic partnerships, from what Ron highlighted, is to have a more smooth ride. As an e-commerce platform, youll have to handle logistics, youll need address system software, internet providers as well as the associations of the vendors youre bringing on board. All these are good to keep close.
 Curious
 When asked about what has surprised him since they launched in Uganda, he stressed that Ugandans are always eager to try out new technologies  when compared to other countries like Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Kenya (which Jumia considers the big 4), Ron says Uganda, ranks in the same caliber when it comes to the willingness to try out new things. This is an upside for those whod like to launch a new platform.
 Launching an e-commerce platform is no joke. But in case you decide to set-up one, we hope you find these guidelines helpful.

"Tony Elumelu Foundation opens application to its 4th Programme
","Tony Elumelu Foundation has opened application to its 4th entrepreneurship program. The foundation made the announcement through a press release on its official blog. The statement said they are now accepting applications for business ideas that can transform Africa.
 Like the past cycles, entrepreneurs will get tools for business success. These include training, a mentor, $5,000 in seed capital and networking opportunities.
 The programme, in its 4th cycle, is the foundation’s 10-year, $100 million commitment to identify, train, mentor and fund 10,000 African entrepreneurs by 2024.
 The Founder, serial entrepreneur and philanthropist Tony O. Elumelu said:
 
 “When we launched the TEF Programme and committed $100 million to empower Africa’s entrepreneurs, I knew we would create impact, but I never imagined it would be the impact of this magnitude. We have unleashed a movement of African entrepreneurs — a force so strong, so inspiring, that I am confident they will collectively transform Africa. We need Africa’s best and brightest entrepreneurs to come learn, grow their businesses and build our continent.”
 
 1,000 entrepreneurs will be selected based on the viability of their idea. This includes market opportunity, financial understanding, scalability, and leadership and entrepreneurial skills demonstrated in the application.
 CEO of the Foundation, Parminder Vir OBE said, “we encourage women, French and Portuguese speakers to apply.
 To be eligible, your business must be based in Africa, for-profit, less than three years old, applicants must be at least 18 and a legal resident or citizen of an African country.
 Last year, over 93,000 entrepreneurs from 55 African countries applied for the 2017 Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program. This more than doubling the number of applications received in 2016.
 Uganda, with 74 entrepreneurs, had the second highest representation after Nigeria which got a representation of 509. (See also: Julius Muwonge on what being a Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Program fellow means to Ugandan Startups).
 Established in 2010, The Tony Elumelu Foundation’s long-term investment in empowering African entrepreneurs is emblematic of Tony Elumelu’s philosophy of Africapitalism, which positions Africa’s private sector, and most importantly entrepreneurs, as the catalyst for the social and economic development of the continent.
 The Foundation’s flagship initiative, the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme, is a 10-year, $100 million commitment to identify, train mentor and fund 10,000 entrepreneurs, capable of changing the face of business across Africa.
 Application deadline is 1st March 2018. Click here to apply.

"In Brief: Base10 Partners is the Largest Ever Black-Led VC Firm
","Having raised $137 million for Base10 Partners, Adeyemi Ajao has put together the largest fund of its kind for a black-led venture firm.
 The 36-year-old co-founded Identified which was acquired by Workday and Tuenti which was acquired by Telefonica.
 Base10 is a standout for its size and joins a short, but growing list of black-led venture firms, including Backstage Capital, Precursor Ventures and Plexo Capital, which have opened up shop in recent years.
 Unlike Backstage Capital—which targets startups led by women, people of color and LGBT founders—Base10 will not focus on a particular group of founders.
 And unlike Andreessen Horowitz’s Cultural Leadership Fund, Base10 does not appear to be using appeals to diversity in its marketing materials.
 Andreessen’s $15 million fund announced last month donates a small portion of the total returns to non-profits working to increase the number of minorities in tech and has recruited black celebrities and influencers to participate (people the firm would like to get closer to anyway).

"Rwanda&#8217;s Paul Kagame gives a go ahead to Andela&#8217;s partnership proposal
","In a bid to become a powerhouse when it comes to technology and entrepreneurship in Africa, Rwanda  under Paul Kagame  is taking unusual steps. At least for an African country. And its latest agreement to go ahead with a proposed partnership with Andela says it all.
 The partnership was revealed in a statement [check number 4]  signed by Marie Solange Kayisire  the minister in charge of cabinet affairs  that summed up all the decisions the Rwandan cabinet made earlier this week.
 In a cabinet meeting held on Wednesday this week  chaired by the president, Paul Kagame  Rwanda agreed to work together with Andela to set up a software development hub.
 But, this partnership is likely not going to be close to anything that Andela has set up elsewhere on the continent. Given that it clearly points out that it is a pan-African hub Rwanda is looking at.
 The Cabinet Meeting approved the agreement with ANDELA on [the] establishment of a Pan-Africa hub for software development in Rwanda, reads one of the decisions the cabinet made.
 Unlike startup scenes elsewhere on the continent, the one in Rwanda is spearheaded by the government. Which explains why Andela is looking to enter the market in a joint partnership with the government.
 The document also pointed out that the upcoming conference being organized by GSMA is a joint partnership with Rwanda.

 The Minister of Information, Technology and Communications (MiTEC) informed the Cabinet Meeting that the Government of Rwanda in partnership with the GSM Association is organizing the Mobile 360-Africa series, which will be held in Kigali from 17th to 19th July 2018.
 Andela is currently having operations in Uganda, Nigeria, and Kenya. With offices in all those countries as well as New York. Opening an office  or hub as they referred to it  in Rwanda, will, thus, make it their fourth market on the continent and fifth office.
 The company must also be putting the funding it raised last year towards expansion as it also recently appointed a country director for Uganda.

"RDB &#038; Alibaba organizing a special fellowship for Rwandan entrepreneurs
","Last year, Jack Ma visited Africa for the very first time. He went ahead and committed to empowering 1,000 entrepreneurs from developing countries in five years”. 200 of those would come from Africa.
 Jack Mas goal was to be achieved through the Alibaba e- Founders Initiative that is done in conjunction with UNTCAD. So far, three cohorts have run with around 80 entrepreneurs from Africa. The third took place in June with 29 startups from Africa spending two weeks course in Hangzhou.
 Yet, Rwanda has been able to carve out a fellowship that only focuses on their entrepreneurs. The Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and Alibaba Group are organizing a special e-Founders Fellowship Program for Rwandan entrepreneurs next year.
 RDB, the countrys development agency, says that the aim is so that entrepreneurs get first-hand exposure to e-commerce and digital innovations.

 This is part of the agreements that Rwanda and Alibaba Group signed on 31st October.
 Rwandas President, Paul Kagame, met with Jack Ma  Alibabas Chairman  in October. The two went ahead and launched the first Electronic World Trade Platform (eWTP) in Africa in Kigali. The platform is said to have opened doors for small businesses in Africa to take part in cross-border electronic trade. It was also a result of a partnership between the Government of Rwanda and Alibaba Group.
 Through such initiatives, the East African country hopes to promote a digital economy. As well as offer [Rwandan] entrepreneurs an opportunity to connect with like-minded, leading entrepreneurs in Alibaba and China.

"Why we are Building an Angel investment Network in Uganda
","As the rest of Africa is busy finding its place on the global investment map, a different story  with “steady progress” becoming our reality  is slowly, but surely, being written in Uganda.
 Justice Anup Singh Choudry’s thoughts on Why Investors shun Uganda rings loud and does not even begin to tell the story of entrepreneurs, startups, and SMEs in securing investment.
 The bureaucracy, endemic corruption and confidence when it comes to securing legal redress or commercial justice speak to our national ratings as investors evaluate their destination in appraisal with the region.
 Let us take a step back to understand the impact of the above investment culture to an everyday entrepreneur, startup or SME; just to be clear we are speaking about the most entrepreneurial country in the world.
 In 2016, Africa received over $380M to invest in entrepreneurs, $109M ended up in Nigeria, South Africa received $96M, Kenya $92.M, Rwanda walked away with $16M and Uganda received only $300,000; and yet we are the most entrepreneurial?
 Over the last 3 years, 72% of the financing that has come to East Africa has gone to 3 firms all with Kenyan origin while 90% of it has gone to expat founders; and yet we are the most entrepreneurial?
 At the just ended LeO Economic Forum, I sorely listened to Patrick Muhirwe of Stanbic explaining to young entrepreneurs and innovators how banks work and as you can imagine justifying why banks are not a go-to destination for financing.
 At the same forum, the CEO of Tugenda one of Uganda’s most promising asset finance companies Michael Wilkerson remarked that “the best advice I can give you about raising funds is DON’T — there is none.”
 He goes on to explain the many conversations you will have with investors who will ask for a million documents only to apologize that they only invest in a totally different sector, something that could have been picked up earlier.
 Amidst this reality, the tale of a cross-section of Ugandan entrepreneurs is one driven by passion and determination for an alternative amidst an environment that makes it look like everything is against you. It is almost like moving in the dark.
 ‘The economy is tight’ are perhaps becoming the most spoken words while referring to Uganda’s business environment. The six core requirements of entrepreneurs are capital, networks to scale, market opportunities, skill/competence to consistently improve, information and trends to inform decisions and an enabling policy environment. Most entrepreneurs act in isolation of these and so they fight a lone battle and in most cases pivot off to the next business.
 The rest of Africa is finding its place on the global investment map, part of this is the emergence of Angel Investment as an alternative source of investment for entrepreneurs. Angels are typically the earliest equity investments made in startup companies.
 These could be by experienced entrepreneurs themselves, high net worth individuals and industry thought-leaders that enjoy working with companies at the earliest stages of business formation. Some Angels get involved even before there is a completion of a proof of concept of the idea that they intend to commercialize.
 Probably the most misunderstood component of this relationship is that it is based on only the exchange of capital. Investors need to understand that entrepreneurship is inherently a risky venture. While an entrepreneur must learn “to make revenue-driven decisions, as opposed to passion-driven decisions, the Angel Investor can work as a Catalyst to mitigate risk by grooming a more mature entrepreneur.
 Building The Innovation Village has taught me that creating a destination for entrepreneurs without motivating other pillars of the ecosystem like investors, corporate ventures, and academia is trying to live on an island. Our response to the lack of investors was Kampala Angels Investment Network.
 We mostly targeted Investment clubs that are known for traditional investment options like stock and property including land and buildings. Our count is now six investors and a sudden impact has been the attraction of foreign investors who are pleased with the confidence of local investors and want to match them.
 I am excited to be joining other speakers at the Africa Business Angels Summit in Capetown this November. The Summit promises to bring together angel investors, the venture capital community, corporate partners and government representatives to exchange best practices, share lessons learned, and shape the roadmap for eearly-stageinvesting. It is themed around Co-investing and making it work together’. With most economies in recession working together is the only way forward to unlock capital fast and maximize Uganda and Africa’s entrepreneurial potential.
 For a concept that has taken flight in most of Africa, now is a good time, on top of the age limit debate to begin other conversations like how we might all work together to ensure 95% of our entrepreneurs are not dying in their first year of operation.

"Startup Grind Kampala: Why they Charge for their Events!
","Startup Grind started all the way from Silicon Valley and has been able to spread across the globe. However, few understand the concept. It was briefly introduced in Kampala three years ago but went under the water.
 In this interview, we get to understand why and what the event has for Ugandan entrepreneurs as we interact with the events new Ugandan Chapter director  Jane Ndibarekera. 
 
 What is Startup Grind (Kampala)?
 
 Startup Grind is a global startup community designed to educate, inspire, and connect entrepreneurs. It is powered by Google for Entrepreneurs. We host monthly events in 150 cities and 65 countries featuring successful local founders, innovators, educators and investors who share personal stories and lessons learned on the road to building great companies.
 We believe in making friends, not contacts. We believe in giving, not taking. We believe in helping others before helping yourself. We are truly passionate about helping founders, entrepreneurs and startups succeed. We intend to make their startup journey less lonely, more connected and more memorable.
 Kampala is one of the cities that hosts these kinds of events and we have successfully had one event where we hosted Julie Muriuki from Nairobi.
 
  You launched in 2014 (in Kampala) but went mute thereafter. What happened? And, why have you decided to come back in 2017
 
 Yes at first the Kampala Chapter was being directed by Richard Zulu but he got busy with other commitments and it went mute.
 I attended a startup grind event in Nairobi in August last year and was inspired by what they were doing so I asked for more details and  I ended up applying again to be the next Chapter Director. So we are now back and in full shape.
 
 3. This is your second event this year. How did the first one go and what should attendants expect from this one?
 The first event was a complete success, it was the first time of organizing such an event and we were able to get over 40 attendants. The feedback we got was very good and I believe we shall get even more people this time.
 This month we as the Startup Grind family is hosting female founders in all the different countries so we are hosting Janet Bugembe the founder of Cinq Diamandes Investments and Cinq Diamandes (U) Ltd and she will be sharing her life as a female founder and also a mentor. Attendants should expect to get tips on how to be successful as women entrepreneurs.
 
 4. Both events this year have hosted regional speakers  is your current focus on exploring regional thought leaders?
 We are not targeting only regional speakers but since we have just resumed hosting events, we need to first gain ground and also have enough sponsorship.
 
 5. What should Ugandan startup founders and entrepreneurs expect from you the remaining part of the year?
 They should expect that we are going to change the way entrepreneurs think because we are going to bring entrepreneurs who are going to change their mindsets.
 
 Most events around Kampala are free of charge but still struggle to attract attendants. Will the paid for event attract these people? Why so?
 
 Yes we understand that and we have been discouraged by many people but the main reasons we do this is because we want to attract the intended audience for these events that is people who are actually going to benefit but not people who just want the free refreshments.
 For more information about the Startup Grind Kampala event, you can follow them on their social media channels; Facebook and Twitter or join the chat group on Meetup!

"Tony Elumelu Foundation Looking for Organizations to Sponsor Additional African Entrepreneurs
","On 22nd March 2017, the Tony Elumelu Foundation announced the successful candidates for this years entrepreneurship program. In its third year, the foundation notes the significant growth in applications since the Programme was launched in 2015.
 The programme received close to 100,000 applications and out of these, 38,000 entrepreneurs were able to navigate and completely fill the application which they claim helped them understand some aspects they didnt know about entrepreneurship.
 
 According to the Tony Elumelu Foundation, it is not only the number of applications that has increased  but the quality as well. This, of course, has presented another challenge. One that wasnt anticipated prior to launching the program.
 The Foundation has a limited budget of $100 Million which is spread over a period of 10 years. This means that, in its budget, it can not take up more than 1,000 entrepreneurs per program. Yet, they feel more than 1000 entrepreneurs have ideas that can not only create jobs for Africans but also build the African economy.
 They are therefore looking to circumvent this by allowing partners on board to help them sponsor additional numbers. Any organization willing to sponsor an entrepreneur shall part with $5000 per entrepreneur.  The additional benefits like training, mentoring, networking and ongoing support shall be handled by the Tony Elumelu Foundation.
 For the Companies, this will offer a huge opportunity to those looking to do Corporate Social Responsibility or for ideas that can improve their services or operations but dont have a budget to organize a program of the same caliber.
 As for the entrepreneurs who didnt go through but believe there ideas were worth being part of the programme, this will be more than a second chance.

"Uganda&#8217;s tech community is not happy about NIRA&#8217;s way of doing business
","NIRA, National Identification and Regulatory Authority, is yet to embrace the digital era. And the Ugandan tech community isnt happy about that. The body that handles the National Identification Register still collects data manually. A process not only slow but prone to errors.
 It all started when James Wire Lunghabo lost his National ID and decided to reach out to NIRA via twitter;
 “I misplaced my ID and cant [sic] find it. However, I have a soft copy of the same. Please outline for me the procedure to get a new copy of my ID,” James tweeted.
 In response, NIRA wrote; “Get a police letter”, then “fill in [the] replacement form [manually]”. They added that the form was “downloadable from our website or [can be] acquired from any of our offices”. After that, he had to “attach [the] bank payment receipt of 50,000/=” and “submit [it] to our office at Kololo ceremonial grounds”.
 &nbsp;
 
 1-Get a police report (only for the lost ID)
 2- Fill in replacement form (downloadable from our website or acquired from any of our offices).
 3-Attach bank payment receipt of 50,000/=
 4-Submit to our office at Kololo ceremonial grounds.#NationalIDUg https://t.co/4No6CA4iMc
 — NIRA (@NIRA_Ug) March 9, 2018
 James downloaded the form and shared it with the tech community. Accompanied by the message;
 
 “Im now stuck. Been pondering over this process that I must go through. I have to manually fill in all the information, walk to a bank and pay [UGX] 50k, then head to Kololo [Airstrip] and submit [it]. I keep wondering, could some integration in form of MM [Mobile Money] as well as an online web form have helped facilitate this? #Shame #BigShame.
 
 To many, this is not new for a government MDA. Yet, others still maintain that something like this shouldn’t be happening in 2018.
 TMS Ruge, one of the vocal tech community members, said that “I know this is Uganda, but come on for the love of digital!! Common sense is cheap!”
 “A pdf form. Which you fill out manually, physically give to someone, to type BACK into a computer. In 2018?”
 The conclusion by the tech community is that the entire process can be done online.
 Kenya has already solved this problem including payment for all government services. The countrys eCitizen portal allows you to apply for Government to Citizen services. And pay for them as well via mobile money, Debit Cards and eCitizen agents. In fact, the country will be rolling out e-Passports as early as 2019.
 Plus, NITA-U has an already running eCitizen portal. It already has several eGovernment services. Perhaps, this being a critical issue, should have been one of the services added already.
 Last week, NITA-U released the findings of the National IT Survey 2017/18. It said that “MDAs have embraced the use of digital platforms to provide government services.” Noting that “half of them (50.7%) [are] offering e-Government services via the web.” While “19.5% [were offering] via SMS and 13% using mobile applications.”
 But, the same report indicates that over 90% of MDAs still use PDF as a way of disseminating information. It also indicates that ICT workforce in MDAs forms less than 1.9% of the total.

"Uber apparently wants to acquire Careem for around $2B to $2.5B
","Rumors of Uber acquisition of Careem wont go away, even when the Egyptian Competition Authorities warned them against any mergers. Bloomberg first reported in July that Uber was looking to merge with its fiercest Middle East rival. The company cited three people familiar with the matter.
 An Uber spokesman declined to comment when asked to confirm or deny talks with Careem by TechCrunch. While a Careem spokeswoman, Maha Abouelenein, told them that they do not comment on rumors.
 Yet, these rumors seem not to be going away. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported again that the two are in advance talks. Again, the company has cited close sources to the acquisition. Though, it has pointed out that the acquisition will be in the range of between $2 billion to $2.5 billion.

 It seems Careems investors are not interested in the deal. But Bloomberg says that the ride-hailings Careem’s management is working to convince the firm’s shareholders of the merits of a deal. Adding that no final decisions have been made, and the companies may decide against the transaction.
 The Uber-Careem merger could be as a result of a rivalry that is becoming costly with time. Yet, as a company that is looking to IPO in 2019, cutting costs and having a sign of turning a profit might be one of their priorities.
 Uber has before cut deals as a way of exiting markets where competition had become fierce.
 In March, the ride-hailing company retreated from South East Asia after it decided to sell its business in the region to competitor Grab. The sale price wasn’t disclosed, but as part of the deal, Uber got a 27.5 percent stake in the company.
 In China, Uber decided to merge its China operation with its mainland ride-hailing rival Didi Chuxing in a $35 billion deal. Didi went on to invest $1 billion in Uber at a $68 billion valuation, while Uber China investors received a 20% stake in the rival company.
 Similarly, in Russia, the company ceded the market to competitor Yandex. As part of the deal, Uber invested $225 million while Yandex contributed $100 million into a new joint company in which Yandex would own 59.3 percent.
 Looking at the past exit deals or mergers Uber has done, it is unlikely that this one will be any different. Perhaps, Uber will decide to exit and invest in Careem. Given that the startup is also looking for funding after their recent $500 million Series E round as it continues to expand in MENA.

"Ugandan edtech startup KAINO Africa launches its mvp tablet
","
 
 KAINO Africa, a Ugandan EdTech startup, has today launched its Minimum Viable Product  MVP at an event in Kampala.
 Alfred Opio, the CEO, informed me that they are now going into private beta testing in some schools. We have four schools which offered to run this private beta; Two in the urban and two schools in the rural, Alfred said.
 Founded in January 2018, KAINO is developing a school management system and a content marketplace.
 The startup states on their website that they empower teachers by aggregating academic content. This includes; lesson guides, assessment tests, learner’s workbooks, digital textbooks and more.
 According to Alfred, KAINO Africa outsources all hardware requirements. Their only focus is the software and design. The tabs run on Android, though customed to KAINOs platform.
 Currently, they are in talks with one of the leading telecoms in Uganda to enter into a partnership. This will see the telecom co-brand KAINOs tabs. The telecom will also whitelist the KAINO app, allowing users access without paying for internet.

 Beyond the telecoms, they have also secured a partnership with a publisher called Sipro. Plus, they are also in talks with the association of Ugandan publishers for a partnership.
 Their business model actually requires them to have such partnerships because it would be expensive to carry out content creation and distribution of the tabs. Yet, they are also reducing their margins given that they are running a revenue share model.
 When it comes to competition, the market also has players like Mixa Kids and Edutab by TOD Idea. Both of these are looking at empowering the children with tablets that have content ranging from educational to entertainment.
 Alfred also informed me that they have managed to raise an angel round to date but wasnt willing to disclose the details. Though, he also added that they are currently looking to raise a Seed round of $50,000. This would propel them to 50 schools across the country.

"On Uganda’s Digital Economy: To tax or not to tax mobile money?
","Currently, there are debates in Uganda on the issues of taxing the digital economy. Thats the Social Media tax and Mobile Money transaction tax. Just to say at the outset, I believe levying these taxes is wrong.
 There have been many submissions in this regard. Some citing double taxation and the regressive and unfair taxes with no equity.
 Though to me the bigger worry is different. That is that there seems to be a deep lack of understanding, on the part of the Country’s leadership, of the digital economy we are living in today. There is little appreciation of how value is created and the flows of this value. As well as the skills required to play or take part in the new digital economy.
 Also read: The Innovation Village to host Kampala Sparks as a build up to Sahara Sparks
 So, Uganda’s leadership are looking like the proverbial deer caught in the headlights.
 The digital economy is estimated at US $3 trillion globally. And growing at 5% — 6% annually. Thats according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. It is also worth noting that the Digital Economy has grown over the last 20 years only!
 What, then, is the Digital Economy?
 The Digital Economy encompasses all information communication technology hardware and software. Including all transactions, platforms and digitized products and services transferred through digital channels.
 Networks such as the internet and mobile communications are the foundation of the Digital Economy. At the heart of the digital economy are e-payments and e-commerce as a way of exchanging and moving value.
 Several businesses reflect the digital economy. Such as Uber (transportation), SafeBoda (transportation), Airbnb (housing), Facebook (social network), Jumia (retail/e-commerce) and Microsoft (cloud).
 Over the last 20 years digitization has been happening and continues to happen. With technologies such as Social media/ Digital platforms; Big data and analytics; Cloud; Mobile devices and applications; Enterprise systems; and the Internet which are all growing.
 Yet, the most disruptive technologies are yet to mature. This is expected to happen in at least the next 10 years. These include the Internet of Things, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Conversational Computing (for example chatbots), Augmented and Virtual Reality, Blockchain, Autonomous Agents and 3D Printing.
 The impact on society and economies of this digitization needs to be anticipated and managed appropriately.
 Also read: Here’s what ICTAU and PSFU proposed to parliament before OTT and Mobile Money taxes came into effect
 We are on an evolutionary journey and the evolution of the digital economy can be traced through from digitization of the physical world to the eventual augmentation of human capabilities.
 The steps of this evolution journey may be summarized as:
 
 Digitization — knowledge, and information become digitized, democratized and the volume of information increases exponentially.
 Combination — standardized digitized information from different sources can be combined based on common denominators;
 Automation — routine knowledge work, characterized by information handling and processing can be captured in algorithms and rules and fully automated.
 Augmentation — digital technology used to augment human physical capabilities, to be able to perform tasks that require more strength, more precision. Each of these stages builds on each other.
 
 In Uganda and most of Sub-saharan Africa, we are largely at stage 1. With some sectors such as financial services, media and telecoms more advanced along the evolutionary journey.
 We are creating a digital overlay of our physical world which has been happening over the last 20 years. When mobile and internet started to proliferate in our societies and economy.
 Digitisation should bring all aspects of the economy into the digital sphere with all the benefits around tracking, connectivity, KYC/AML, customized solutions, convenience, lower costs and efficiency. Most importantly digitization leads to greater knowledge of flows of value and who holds this value.
 Yet the proposed taxes do not recognize and appreciate the full effects of this digital transformation journey. By not allowing digitization to happen, we kill the digital economy before it fully takes shape.
 Also read: These are the Ugandan startups in Hangzhou participating in Alibaba’s eFounders Initiative
 Furthermore, we do not allow the development of skills required for this economy. Thus, cannot take part in the economy of the future.
 Our hope lies in educating our leaders and our society about the digital economy value chain. And showing them how the value is created and can be harnessed together with preparing for a digital economy future.
 Public sector participation in the development of a digital economy should focus on creating a suitable environment for the digital economy to grow and in harnessing the efficiencies such an economy brings.
 There are examples abound on how this is being done. For example;
 1. Ensuring data privacy and protection (EU)
 2. Supporting digital initiatives (Singapore Autonomous Vehicle Initiative)
 3. Taking a wait and see approach (China allowed Alibaba and Tencent to grow and only recently monitoring and restricting of peer to peer lending platforms).
 4. A growing sharing economy working with regulators (USA).
 In contrast, the risk-averse and regulation-centric approach to managing technological change and a strong government involvement has resulted in the failure of digital payments to takeoff in Japan against a backdrop of conflicting legacy technologies.
 Levying the mobile money transaction tax and social media tax is not the way to create a suitable environment to grow and harness the digital economy.
 Also read: Liquid Telecom and AfriLabs enter into a partnership
 A more sustainable approach while also widening the tax base and grow tax revenue would be:
 
 Convene relevant actors
 Agree on an understanding of the digital economy ecosystem, including what aspects the government should seek to grow in line with the national strategy.
 Identify the flows of revenue and value in the digital economy and who is responsible.
 Target policy towards revenue and value with the aim to increase and then sustainably tax.
 Continue to invest in digital infrastructure, empower participation in the digital economy largely through the provision of relevant digital infrastructure and local skills.
 
 By debating whether to tax or not to tax mobile money without addressing the wider digital economy implications, we risk not seeing the wood for the trees.

"MTN Uganda&#8217;s financial results show the company is recovering from subscriber disconnection
","Yesterday, MTN Group released its financial results for 2017. The numbers are looking good. The results show that MTN Uganda experienced a 10% revenue growth to UGx. 1.4 Trillion.
 This is a strong turn around of events as the company previously saw a 1.9% revenue decline in 2016. Its first in 20 years.
 The revenue growth is attributed to the strong growth in data and digital revenues. The companys data revenue increased by 41.4% which was underpinned by an increase in data traffic and good growth in data bundle adoption.
 Yet. all this was on the back of a 2016 revenue decline. Something that could have signalled a change in direction of focus. The 2016 report cited the decrease in outgoing and incoming voice revenue as the reason.
 But, the company reported that active data subscribers closed the year at 1.5 million for 2017. They also experienced a digital revenue increase of 16.1%. This was supported mainly by MFS which experienced over 21.9% growth. In the year 2017, MFS revenue contributed 23% of total revenue. The number of active Mobile Money customers also increased by 27.6% to 5.2 million.
 The company also experienced a 1.9% growth in subscribers from 10.5 Million to 10.7 Million. Due to attractive personalised bundled products introduced at the end of 2016, improved network quality and effective distribution. Though this was a slower increase compared to 2016s 18.1% increase.
 It is not only MTN experiencing the growth in the number of subscribers. Earlier this year, Airtel Uganda MD, VG Somasekha said the company had hit 10 Million subscribers. This means a decrease in MTNs market share.
 At the group level, MTN reported improved results after returning profitability in headline earnings. Though macroeconomic conditions were challenging across many markets.
 For example, the group cited a weaker naira as well as hard currency liquidity challenges in Nigeria. Then a technical recession in South Africa and weakened currencies in other markets like Iran.
 The groups president and CEO Rob Shuter was quoted saying “MTN delivered a solid overall performance for the year, with progress on many fronts, despite difficult economic conditions as well as operational and regulatory challenges in certain markets. MTN Nigeria showed strong constant currency revenue growth and MTN South Africa’s postpaid business displayed encouraging improvements.
 MTN Mobile Money and rich-media services supported growth in digital revenue, however, this slowed in the second half as we optimised our value-added services (VAS) subscription business.”
 In Uganda, it seems all telecoms good run might come to a halt factoring in the recent moves by Uganda Communication Commission. The communications regulatory authority recently announced new regulations.
 Also read: UCC goes after bloggers, digital media and other online publishers
 It started by issuing guidelines on where SIM Cards can and should be sold. Requiring telecoms to only sell SIM Cards at their designated service centres only.
 A week later, it followed up with a rule for telecoms to work with NIRA &amp; UCC to implement the necessary technical requirements in order to comply with UCCs new guidelines on the sale of SIM Cards.
 This meant no telecom can sell SIM Cards until the exercise is complete. This might affect the growth in the number of subscribers the way subscriber disconnection did back in 2015.

"What You Should Know About Africa&#8217;s First Unicorn Ahead of Its IPO
","Launched in 2012, Jumia Group is set to become Africa’s first technology company to list on the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, it is poised to become the first unicorn, company with a valuation estimated at over $1 billion. However, although the company bills itself as African  we do too, per our classification  many still contest Jumia’s ‘Africanness’.
 Although Jumia’s majority shareholder is South African-based MTN Group with a 29% stake, the rest of the ownership  over 70% is held by European and American firms. The company  although maintains local subsidiaries who are each registered in their respective countries of operations  is also headquartered and incorporated in Berlin, Germany as Jumia Technologies AG.
 As a private company registered as Africa Internet Holding GmbH in Germany, not much information relating to its performance has been shared with the public except for metrics surrounding Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), Number of Customers as well as the Adjusted EBITDA which are published annually as part of Rocket Internet’s Annual Financial Reports.
 Yet, with the filing for IPO, the disclosure requirements mean that information that was previously private has been made public. In this research brief, we pick out the most compelling details from the F-1 filing and summarize them ahead of Jumia’s IPO. Do note that the terms Jumia and Jumia Group are used interchangeably to refer to ‘Jumia Technologies AG’.
 2012  2014: Formation
 Africa Internet Holding GmbH was incorporated on June 26, 2012, as a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) under German law. However, it launched its operations as Africa Internet Group in 2012 with Jumia Nigeria  an e-commerce platform  as its flagship venture. Africa Internet Group  which later rebranded to Jumia Group  was structured like the other internet holdings that Rocket Internet launched in other emerging parts of the world  Middle East Internet Group, Asia Pacific Internet Group, and Latin America Internet Group
 The Group was co-founded by two French ex-McKinsey consultants Jeremy Hodara, Sacha Poignonnec  both 38 years. These were joined by Raphael Kofi Afaedor (Ghanaian), and Tunde Kehinde (Nigerian) to launch the Jumia Nigeria venture. Rocket Internet quickly launched a series of other internet ventures ranging from food delivery to ride-hailing. These were; Hellofood, Kaymu, Jumia, Everjobs, Vendito, Lamudi, Carmudi, EasyTaxi, Lendico, and many others. Some of these have since shut down while others were rebranded.
 In 2014, Tunde Kehinde and Raphael Kofi Afaedor exited the company under unclear circumstances. Tunde ended up co-founding a fintech called Lidya as well as a logistics startup called Africa Courier Express.
 
 
 2016  2018: Scale and Focus
 In 2016, the company raised a €360M Series C round at a valuation of $1.04 billion. Following the Series C, the company decided to harmonize all its subsidiaries under the same brand, giving birth to the Jumia Group. However, it continued to trade as Africa Internet Holding GmbH until January 31, 2019, when its name in Germany registry was officially changed to Jumia Technologies AG.
 In 2016, at the height of its scale, Rocket Internet’s Africa Internet Group had operations across 35 African countries per its report for that year. But, the company either shut down or dissolved (mostly) classifieds ventures into Jumia Deals. The moves were in line with Rocket Internet’s approach of maintaining a “long-term focus on market leadership” by “aggressively backing winners and closing the nonperformers”.
 Some of the ventures that they have shutdown include EasyTaxi (around 2016) and Jumia Car (Carmudi) whose time is not clear. It also sold off some of its Jumia House operations across Africa to PropertyPro (former ToLet.ng) in Nigeria, MeQasa in Ghana and AngoCasa in Angola In November 2017. In other markets, they dissolved Jumia Jobs (formerly Everjobs) and Jumia House (formerly Jumia House) into Jumia Deals (formerly Vendito) starting from the end of 2017 through 2018. These include operations in Uganda, Tanzania, Cameroon, Gabon, Rwanda, Zambia, and more.
 The above shutdowns and disposals signaled a new direction for the company which is further revealed in the F-1 filing. Looking at the prospectus, Jumia is moving to become more e-commerce focused with all the other arms merely offering anchorage to that. They are essentially establishing (Jumia) Marketplace which is supported by (Jumia) Logistics and Jumia Pay as the payments arm. The marketplace model also implies that e-commerce giant has managed to slowly pivot away from being a 1st party e-commerce platform the way Amazon is to 3rd party marketplace the way Alibaba is.
 Funding &amp; Valuation
 In 2016, Goldman Sachs led a group of other investors and acquired shares in the company, which valued Jumia at $1.2 billion. The e-commerce giant then became the first private technology company across the African continent to hit the $1 billion valuation mark, achieving the ‘first African unicorn’ moniker.
 The latest public valuation was estimated at around €1.4 billion ($1.6 billion) as of December 2018 when they raised a €75 million ($84.4 million) corporate minority round from Pernod Ricard Deutschland GmbH, a Germany subsidiary of the French alcoholic beverage produce Pernod Ricard S.A.
 However, before that, the company’s valuation had long been estimated at over $1 billion starting from 2016 when it raised its highest funding round  a Series C  of €360M ($405M) that was led by MTN Group and Rocket Internet per CrunchBase. In total, Jumia Group has raised at least $852 million in funding across five (5) different funding rounds.
 Jumias number of active customers almost doubled in 2018
 The company was launched with a $45 million Seed round in 2012 from Rocket Internet, Millicom Systems and Blakeney Management. This round was followed by a €130 million ($146.3 million) Series B in 2013 led by Millicom Systems and a $150 million Pre-Series C that was raised at a $405 million Pre-Money Valuation in November 2014.
 In terms of shareholding information, Jumia’s current shareholders are AEH New Africa eCommerce I GmbH (8.4%); Atlas Countries Support SA. Holding (5.8%); AXA Africa Holding SAS (5.8%); Chelsea Wharf Holdings (5.2%); Millicom International Cellular SA (9.6%); Mobile Telephone Networks Holdings Limited (29.7%); Pernod Ricard Deutschland GmbH (5.1%); and Rocket Internet SE (20.6%). It is estimated that each of the co-founders  Sacha and Jeremy  owns approximately 2% of the company. However, it is not clear through which vehicle as there are no direct individual shareholders in the company.
 Locations &amp; Employees
 Jumia is distributed across three (3) continents; Europe, Africa, and Asia. The company is headquartered and incorporated in Berlin, Germany with their tech team stationed in Porto, Portugal. They also maintain a team in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and per their IPO prospectus, they have operations in 14 African countries. However, they point out Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Ivory Coast, and Morocco as their top five markets.
 As of December 31, 2018, Jumia employed a total of 5,128 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. The company’s employees are based in 20 offices across 18 countries. Per the prospectus, 32.8% of Jumia employees are female while 67.2% were male. At the country level, Nigeria has the highest number of employees with 1,213 followed by Egypt with 572 employees.
 Leadership &amp; Management
 Under German law, a stock corporation  which Jumia Technologies AG is  has a two-tier board structure composed of the management board (Vorstand) and the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat). The latter is the equivalent to the board of directors. At the beginning of March 2019, Jumia announced that it had added Golden State Warriors’ player Andre Iguodala to its Supervisory Board.
 On December 18, 2018, the then existing shareholders  including Pernod Ricard  agreed to appoint Gilles Bogaert from Pernod Ricard and Matthew Odgers from MTN to the supervisory board. The supervisory board also includes Blaise Judja-Sato, Jonathan D. Klein, Angela Kaya Mwanza, Alioune Ndiaye, and John H. Rittenhouse. Currently, Jumia’s management board consists of Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec who both serve as the co-Chief Executive Officers and Co-founders of the company.
 
 Initial Public Offering
 On March 12, 2019, Jumia Technologies AG announced that it was setting itself up for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JMIA hoping to raise over $250 million in the process. In the company’s prospectus, it listed Morgan Stanley, Raymond James, Citi Group, Berenberg, RBD Capital Markets, William Blair and Stifel as the Advisors on the IPO. The company never disclosed the share price at which it is considering to list on the NYSE.
 One of the things the prospectus revealed was that the e-commerce giant is still a loss-making business. However, much of the company’s current $1 billion-plus valuation is predicated on how much it is generating in Gross Merchandise Value.
 “The main purpose of the IPO is to bring money to the company,” said Sacha Poignonnec, Co-founder and CEO of Jumia. “We will continue to invest in existing businesses to improve services for consumers and retailers, bring more logistics partners to the platform and implement the strategies currently in place.
 In an updated version of their SEC F-1 filing, Jumia is looking to offer 13.5 million American depository shares (representing 27,000,000 Ordinary Shares) for purchase at a price range of $13 to $16 per share putting the company in a position to raise up to $216 million from the IPO. However, ahead of the IPO, the company announced that Mastercard Europe had agreed to “purchase €50.0 million of our ordinary shares in a concurrent private placement at a price per share equal to the euro equivalent of the initial public offering price per ordinary share”.
 
 The Numbers
 Per the prospectus, Jumia assesses the success of the business “through a set of key performance indicators such as the number of Active Consumers, GMV and Adjusted EBITDA.” They also happen to be the key metrics that valuation for e-commerce businesses is predicated on.
 Jumia defines GMV as “the total value of orders including shipping fees, value-added tax, and before deductions of any discounts or vouchers, irrespective of cancellations or returns.”
 It also defines an active seller as one that “received an order on our marketplace within the 12-month period preceding the relevant date, irrespective of cancellations or returns.” While, an active consumer “means unique consumers who placed an order on our marketplace within the 12-month period preceding the relevant date, irrespective of cancellations or returns.”
 When it comes to the adjusted EBITDA, it “corresponds to the loss for the year, adjusted for income tax expense, finance income, finance costs, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted by share-based payment expense.”
 
 According to the prospectus, as of December 31, 2018, the number of active sellers on the Jumia platform was 81,000, and the number of active consumers was 4 million. In 2018, about 90% of the items sold on the Jumia market platform were provided by third-party sellers, and the remaining 10% were sold directly by Jumia to enhance consumers in major product categories and regions. The company’s number of users jumped from 2.7 million in 2017 to 4.0 million by close of 2018, a growth of 48%.
 According to the prospectus, JMIAs revenue in 2018 was 130 million euros (about 149 million US dollars), and the gross profit was 45.7 million euros (about 52.4 million US dollars) but the company lost 169 million euros (about 194 million US dollars) in the same year.
 As of Dec. 31, 2018, the filings show the company has accumulated losses of nearly $1 billion (the exact number is $960 million. Broken down, Jumia incurred a loss for the year of €165.4 million in 2017 and a loss for the year of €170.4 million in 2018. The company’s GMV was estimated at US $930 million for the year 2018 up from US $570 million in 2017. Based on a 1 billion-plus valuation, this represents a multiple of at least 1.1 times GMV alternatively at 4 million active customers, this is a valuation of $250 per customer.

"UNCDF tasks six companies to offer clean cooking solutions in Uganda
","UNCDF’s CleanStart has selected six companies to deliver clean cooking solutions to Ugandans. It says that these are “partners whose business models present innovative features to deliver clean cookstoves to the last mile.”
 In early 2017, CleanStart opened its first RECF window focused on clean cookstoves in Uganda.
 This window, according to the official statement, “had an unprecedented outreach, with 161 companies interested in the opportunity, and 64 formal Expressions of Interest (EOIs) received.”
 Out of those, “through a rigorous screening of the EOIs based on technical merit, levels of innovation, development impacts such as women and youth job creation, and sustainability”, CleanStart selected 6 partners.

 The selected are Fenix International Uganda, Green Heat Uganda, Simoshi Limited, WANA Energy Solutions, Josa Green Technologies and Raising Gabdho Foundation.
 These will “receive cost-sharing grants from CleanStart, to implement in the Ugandan markets over the next two years.
 “The portfolio of clean cooking solutions is expected to reach more than 40,000 households, businesses, and institutions such as schools, create over 700 jobs and income earning opportunities especially for women and youth, and off-set approximately 400,000 tons of CO2 by 2020.”
 Fenix offers lease-to-own solar home systems for Ugandan households living off-grid. The company is looking at “utilizing their unique credit score created during the customers lifetime” to also “offer clean cookstoves as an upgrade.”

 It says that they have “piloted clean cookstoves loans over the last six months to determine product demand and the right cookstoves to offer our customers.”
 “Our customers showed high levels of satisfaction with the stoves, and their spending on fuel immediately decreased.”
 Another company, WANA Energy Solutions, will implement last-mile clean cooking energy distribution through a smart payGo technology.”
 The company offers a “reliable, affordable and efficient cooking energy from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) by selling complete cooking components  gas, accessories, cylinder and cookstove.”
 UNCDF’s CleanStart programme helps foster access to clean energy for the poor through microfinance. CleanStart, in partnership with the Embassy of Sweden in Uganda, provides grants to the private sector through its Renewable Energy Challenge Fund (RECF).

"EIB to contribute €15M in equity towards AfricInvest&#8217;s €120M Growth Fund
","In May, AfricInvest  a Tunisia-based PE fund  revealed its intentions to launch a startup focused fund. Dubbed AfricInvest Venture Capital Fund, the size of the proposed fund is €120 million.
 According to the European Investment Bank (EIB) filings, AfricInvest is about to secure part of the target amount. The bank stated that they are looking to contribute €15 million to the target amount.
 They described the fund as a project that consists of an equity participation in a €120m venture capital fund. Adding that it will focus on innovative high-growth African SMEs.
 
 The proposed operation concerns a participation in the AfricInvest Growth Venture Capital Fund, a closed-end venture capital fund with a target size of EUR 120m.
 
 The fund will be set up to make privately-negotiated equity and quasi-equity investments to support growing innovative companies in Africa with a predominant focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.
 But, as of September 6, 2018, the proposal was still under appraisal by the bank according to the filings.
 Earlier in the year, AfricInvest VC director Selma Ribica told Ventureburn about the fund. She said that it would target “successful startups” across the continent. “It is aimed to be the first truly African fund with offices in North, East, and West Africa and we aim to raise €120-million,” she added.
 AfricInvest senior manager Yassine Oussaifi also added that the fund would look at existing startups. They would thus inject funding from Series-A level, rather than from seed level.

 This week, we reported that the IFC was considering making a $3 million investment into Nigerias Kobo360. But, before that, the IFC had funded Twiga Foods as well as Africas Talking, both in Kenya.
 This trend is an indicator of the growing interest by such institutions in investing in African startups. The move, thus, by AfriInvest to set-up a fund where the likes of IFC and EIB can be LPs makes sense. This will remove the bureaucracy and also speed up accessibility to the startups.
 Founded in 1994, AfricInvest has over $1.2 billion in assets under management across 17 funds. They also have over 140 portfolio investments and 80+ exits. The PE fund also operates in 25 countries with offices in Tunis, Lagos, Abidjan, Nairobi, Cairo, Algiers, and Casablanca.
 To date, some of their notable portfolio companies include EFC Uganda, UAP Kenya, Planor Capital International (MTN Cote dIvoire) and more.

"[UPDATE] Former Kamwokya-based The Hub Kampala Set to Re-Launch as Design Hub Kampala
","The Hub Kampala, which was a creative collaboration space for creative and like-minded enterprising people, closed 2 years ago. It was founded by Jantien Zuurbier after finding it hard to balance between kid’s toys &amp; noise as well as her web business. The Hub Kampala was located in Kamwokya.
 However, 2 years down the road, Jantien is partnering with Mango Tree, a company that empowers Africa through educational tools, to resurrect The Hub Kampala in the name of Design Hub Kampala – in an even bigger space. Design Hub Kampala is located on 5th Street Industrial just after the Bata Factory Outlet. What is really exciting is its outlook – a warehouse – which she says is an inspiration from her love of art and culture.
 It has taken Jantien over one and a half years to bring Design Hub Kampala to life, given that they had to abandon the first building they got – near Tuskys Bugolobi – on grounds that it was located in the railway path. However, with the new building, Jantien and Mango Tree seem to be on the right track. Design Hub Kampala is registered under Mango Tree Holdings though Jantien will be its director.
 According to the architectural plan for the finished facility, which we had access to on Jantien’s permission, Design Hub Kampala is set to be one of the most comfortable place for both established companies and startups in Uganda.
 It has office space for companies, meeting rooms, a co-working space for individuals and startups that can’t afford office space, an events facility for conferences, movie nights, exhibitions, small concerts etc. It also has a well fitted kitchen and a restaurant which will be run by Kigezi coffee and Kacoon – both Ugandan startups. There is also an open working space that is open to the public at no cost.
 As one of the founding members, Mango Tree is also moving its offices to Design Hub Kampala along with its partners Design Without borders, Panya, Made In Africa TV (MIATV), Adengo Architects, Kigezi Coffee, Dragonfly Media, Delish Kampala  according to the message on its website. Other companies/startups moving into the Hub include 17 Triggers, Tunga, Healthy Entrepreneurs, Kampa Beats, Media Focus Africa and many more.
 The hub shall offer both physical and virtual memberships in order to help as many startups and entrepreneurs,  as well as established companies, as they can. Both memberships carry a subscription fee which Design Hub Kampala declined to reveal as it’s still under consideration.

 Asked about how they expect to make money, Jantien told us they’re looking at renting out office space, membership subscriptions from both startups and individuals and renting out the events as well as meeting spaces. A desk space is likely to start from $50 per month. However, they declined to make a comment on the rates for other services as they haven’t yet reached a final conclusion
 Kampala has witnessed a lot of Hubs/Incubators in the past 5 years however the question is, what value are they really adding to the startups and entrepreneurs in the Country? Some of the Hubs in Kampala include The Innovation Village, Outbox Hub, Hive Colab, Ventures Labs East Africa, Global Business Lab and many more.
 UPDATE: Design Hub Kampala is launching on the 29th of April 2017. Details here.

"UPDATED: These job adverts indicate SafeBoda is setting up an office in Barcelona
","Ugandas boda-hailing startup, SafeBoda, looks to be setting up an office in Barcelona, Spain, with its recent job adverts. The company currently has 8 job positions open for applications and marked new on Landing.jobs.
 The job positions range from intermediate to senior level with salaries ranging from €35,000 to €65,000 as well as compensation like employee stock options.
 The job adverts are; Fullstack Engineer, Back-end Engineer, Senior Software Engineer (Android), Backend-Engineer (Elixir), Senior Software Engineer (Android), Software Engineer (Android), Senior Back-end Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Software Engineer (iOS) and Senior Software Engineer (iOS).
 Yet, it seems that these will have to travel to East Africa. As one of the perks points out an opportunity to travel to East Africa and interact with the product and our multi-cultural team.
 This move is perhaps as a result of the current scaling the company is pursuing which might need them to hire a more sophisticated team of engineers to handle the level of scale they want.
 In the past few months, the company has had issues with its application where it was hard for one to hail a boda and had to continue requesting many times or wait for a couple of minutes. Though this seems to be getting under control lately.
 This is not the first time SafeBoda is seeking external help to enable them to cope with the growing demand for their product.
 Towards the end of 2016, SafeBoda hired Jonathan Block, an ex-Lyft engineer to help them work on their new app at that time. Jonathan, in his Medium blog, wrote that his mission was to serve as interim CTO for 1 month.
 Also read: SafeBodas rumored to have raised $1.1 Million this year
 He was thus required to provide leadership to a small ride share engineering team, paving the way for future success.
 This move wont make SafeBoda the first startup operating in Africa to have a distributed team across another continent. Jumia Groups technical team is spread across Europe and the Middle East  Dubai to be specific.
 Fenix International also has a team spread across the US, Europe as well as Asia. While Flutterwave, Tala, Branch and a couple of others all have offices in the USA.
 Update:
 SafeBoda co-founder and co-CEO, Alastair Sussock got in touch with us and clarified on the issue. He said that the move is to prepare the company to handle the level of scale they are onto.
 Our goal is to scale the SafeBoda platform and provide more services to drivers and passengers in Kampala and across East Africa so we need to grow our technology stack fast, Alastair wrote.
 Though, he maintained that the majority of our tech will be in Kampala and we are hiring aggressively to find the best talent in the East Africa region.
 
 We are also experimenting by trying to hire in another location and manage it from afar.
 
 On why they chose Barcelona, Alastair pointed out the fast-rising status of the city. We decided on trying Barcelona as it’s becoming a strong European tech hub, he said. Adding that the time zone is also close to that of East Africa.

"Press Release: Uganda&#8217;s GoBigHub raises USD 250,000 as part of Series B targeting USD 5,000,000
","GoBighub, a platform that connects local investors to local entrepreneurs, has begun fundraising for their series B with USD. 250,000 investment. This was by a below the radar European boutique investment fund, Star Fund.
 The family office boutique fund made the investment as a lead investor. Representing three other family office funds with a target of investing up to USD. 50 million dollars in Africa within this financial year.
 GoBigHub has created a pool of funds capitalized by local investors. GoBig No Collateral Contract Financing Fund, focused on financing LPOs, tenders, contract farming, and such short-term jobs by youth and women at ticket sizes averaging UGX. 15,000,000 per contract, and for not more than 3 months.
 The fund charges an application fee for due diligence and monitoring of 1.5% deducted on disbursement, and profit sharing at the ratio of 60:40, to the favor of the entrepreneur.
 The investment, one of several, will be a mix of minority equity stake, but control of the board. Further, the mix equity and debt instrument have both instruments having convertible features, to hedge risks, and offer the investor the best of both worlds, in terms of return and risk matrix.
 The fund was created as a solution to the challenge facing youth and women businesses in Uganda that are struggling to get tenders and LPOs. Most of these micro-entrepreneurs lack the capital to finance the contracts. Either due to lack of security, or due to lack of mandatory 3-years-in-business rule before they can access a loan, or both.
 GoBigHub also runs a crowdfunding platform that has over the last year seen some individual investors and investment clubs invest up to of USD. 315,310 in local micro-enterprises.
 Founded by Ojijo, a trained lawyer and poet turned entrepreneur, and former schoolmates from the UK, gobighub.com is in the building phase of the fund. Hence the naming of the fundraising as series B “Build”. And, intends to raise a total of USD 5,000,000 before end of this financial year in a mix of both equity and debt.

 The fund is also targeting other businesses in the region, and was attracted by GoBigHub’s risk management model, a five-pronged risk management strategy of: (1) insuring the contract; (2) direct disbursement of funds by gobighub.com to the suppliers, to ensure that entrepreneurs actually procure the items needed to be supplied; (3) liening of company shares, assets, bank accounts, and payment accounts, to ensure GoBigHub controls funds when contract is paid; (4) 360 degree due diligence and supervision of entire contract from issuance, through delivery, until payment; and (5) full financing model based on paying for all costs, including incidental costs to ensure delivery.
 The fund manager, Karl Mark, also noted that the stellar returns by GoBigHub, averaging 9% per quarter (after tax), hence, an annual return of 36% a year, is only rivaled by only the topmost hedge funds and best-traded forex funds. The micro-ticket size averaging UGX. 15 million, provides an opportunity for scaling, and wider reach of the fund to more beneficiary enterprises.
 Previously located in Kabalagala on Tirupati Mazima Mall, GoBigHub recently relocated to Lourdel road on AHA Towers.

"Africa’s Talking Promotes Chief Commercial Officer To CEO Role
","We can change Africa in our lifetime. This is the mantra that drives everything we do. We know that Africas unique problems can only be solved efficiently by Africans. Over the years, Africas Talking has grown to become a company that is community driven, innovative and not afraid to go the extra mile to offer more value to software developers.
 We believe that they play a crucial role in helping Africa take its rightful place in the Tech revolution. This is why we sought out to accelerate our growth and bring more like-minded individuals along on this journey.
 Mid 2018, we closed our series A funding round with investors who share the same vision we have for developers in Africa. Our objective for creating these partnerships is to expand Africas Talking in a way that not only impacts more software developers in Africa but also creates an environment that we can offer mentorship so that they succeed and scale across the continent.
 To achieve this, we incorporated Africas Talking Group whose goal is to create a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem for Africa through equipping developers and businesses with what they need to be successful.
 This initiative was started by Samuel Gikandi and Bilha Ndirangu and they will drive its mission. This umbrella corporation will house two companies, Africa’s Talking and Africa’s Talking Labs (AT Labs), that will respectively actualize its goals by:
 
 Lowering the barriers for access to communications, payments and cloud infrastructure to software developers and businesses across Africa.
 Providing an environment where it can co-create value with partners within its network and accelerate the path to market for technology startups.
 
 This change in structure also called for a shift in leadership as each of these companies is currently working on different strategies. Africas Talking’s next frontier is to expand its reach to all 54 countries in Africa, creating partnerships and impacting developer communities. So as to effectively achieve this, Bilha Ndirangu, who was Chief Commercial Officer, Africas Talking, steps up to be CEO, Africas Talking.
 We will be tapping into her experience in building organizations by creating partnerships with different stakeholders and scaling them to new markets. Seeing that AT Labs is still a new entity with a few startups who need help in growing to fully-fledged businesses across Africa, it needed the expertise of someone who has walked this path before.
 Samuel Gikandi, previous CEO and co-founder of Africas Talking was a natural choice for CEO, AT Labs. His vision for this entity is to equip more people with skills involved in creating profitable businesses with as little hurdles as possible.
 We believe that this new structure will help us concentrate on our common goal and create environments that foster success for Africas current and future generations.

"BitPesa closed $2.2M in funding according to their recent SEC filings
","BitPesa, a digital foreign exchange and payment platform, raised $2.2 million in a bridge round. That is according to an SEC filing that the company made on June 14, 2018.
 The startup was seeking to raise a total of $2.5 million, but, they came short of the target by $288,896. The funding raised was a mixture of debt and equity though it not clear who the investors were.
 This funding brings the total disclosed amount raised by BitPesa throughout 2018 to at least $7.23 million. After combining this $2.21 million with the $5.02 million that they raised from Japanese corporation, Sompo Holdings.
 In total, the company has raised a total of at least $15.64 million in disclosed funding. Some of their notable investors include; GreyCroft Partners and Future Perfect Ventures.
 Elizabeth Rossiello, BitPesas CEO and Co-founder, is among the signatories on the filing.
 According to the filing, BTC Africa S.A raised the funding. Checking BitPesas website indicates that it is their registered entity in Luxembourg and the UK. Given that BitPesa started operations in 2013 and BTC Africa S.A was established in 2017, the latter must be the holding company.
 Founded by Amy Ludlum, Charlene Chen and Elizabeth Rossiello and launched in Nairobi in 2013, BitPesa now has offices in Lagos, London, Luxembourg, Madrid, and Dakar. To set up the Spanish office, they acquired Madrid-based TransferZero for an undisclosed amount in February last year.
 BitPesa isnt alone. Last year, we compiled a list of companies that never disclosed funding raised. This included; PayGo Energy ($3.5M), Lori Systems ($6.1M), Halan ($4.3M), PrepClass ($300k), African Leadership Academy ($28M)and more.

"Facebook is secretly fighting the recently implemented social media tax in Uganda
","Facebook is secretly fighting the recently implemented social media tax by the Ugandan government. We learned this from Kojo Boakye, the Public Policy Manager as well as Access and Connectivity for Facebook for Africa, yesterday.
 He was speaking at a dialogue event that took place yesterday at Protea Hotel, Kampala.
 The dialogue was organized by CIPESA in collaboration with the internet society  the Uganda chapter. It focused on the “Impact of Social Media and Mobile Money Taxation in Uganda.”
 According to Kojo there are many things Facebook is doing to fight the tax that he or Facebook may not let the public know about.
 “There are many many things we are doing that we can not put in the media,” Kojo said. Adding that he spent the bulk of yesterday [26/08/2018] engaging both government and other concerned stakeholders.
 “Across the board, we have been speaking to stakeholders. Most of my time today has been spent speaking to government and stakeholders,” Kojo pointed out.
 This was in response to a lady who intimated that Facebook is not concerned about markets that do not significantly contribute to the bottom line.
 Also read: Revised mobile money tax and airtime scratch card ban good for building a cashless economy
 A few weeks back, there was a message making rounds of social media which intimated that Facebook was going to sue the government of Uganda for levying a fee on a product that they did not own. But, Kojo classified that as fake news.
 Reiterating that even if they could take the government to court, that is the best way to resolve the issue from their point of view.
 “I don’t think it is something that we are considering doing at the moment, but I also don’t think is the best way to go about this,” Kojo said.
 Given he is of Ghanaian descent, Kojo also pointed out that beyond them being ambassadors of Facebook in Africa, they are also ambassadors of the continent within the social media company.
 Also read: Here’s what ICTAU and PSFU proposed to parliament before OTT and Mobile Money taxes came into effect
 “We are ambassadors for Facebook in Africa. But we are also ambassadors of Africa in Facebook.”
 Kojo hinted at some of the adverse effects of the tax. One of them was that this tax will likely render the fiber that the company has so far laid useless.
 “We invested millions in fiber that is going to be rendered useless,” Kojo said. He also pointed out that he has engaged bloggers and others whose work has been affected thus far.
 “I was with Ugandan bloggers and many are not as able to make money as they were before [the implementation of the tax],” he said.
 There’s a couple of reasons to cause concern for Facebook on the recently introduced tax. One is that the company fears that the tax might spread to other (African) countries as long as the Ugandan government walks away “scot free”. For example. Egypt recently started classifying individuals with over 5000 followers or audience as media houses.
 Additionally, a new survey of 3015 respondents indicated an increasing use of VPNs among Ugandans. This implies that Facebook advertisers targeting Facebook users in Uganda will not achieve their intended results. Something that goes back to bite the company.
 According to Kojo, Facebook doesn’t make a significant revenue out of Uganda. Yet, this move kills any hopes of such revenues becoming significant at one point.
 Beyond Facebook, Aga Sekalala Jr  who is setting up the first Angel/VC fund by a Ugandan  also complained about the mobile money and social media tax. This was in an interview I recently had with him.

"Taking a look at Bitland, just a year after launching in Uganda
","Bitland Uganda, a subsidiary of Bitland Global, launched in Uganda in June 2017. At that time, many in Uganda had little or no knowledge about Blockchain.
 But, thanks to the dramatic rise and fluctuation of Bitcoin price  which made it dominate news across the globe  as well as the Africa Blockchain Conference organized earlier this year, many can now say they have a basic understanding of Blockchain.
 If you do not know Bitland, it is a blockchain powered land registry system. It seeks to help communities resolve any land conflicts.
 Thus, Bitland Uganda portal is a software upgrade built on top of the Bitland Global software. The aim is to cater for the unique land tenure issues of Uganda.
 Bitland [Global] exists to provide the backbone in the effort to unlock land capital through the democratization of real property ownership utilizing leading-edge technology, the company states on its website.
 In a bid to scale its solution, the Bitland expanded to Uganda through a partnership with the Blockchain Asset Group Uganda Ltd.
 Bitland Uganda is in partnership with Bitland Global to implement a land registry Blockchain in Uganda, said Edgar Mwambutsa. The head of partnerships at Blockchain Asset Group Uganda.
 Christopher Bates, the Chief Security Officer at Bitland Global, told me in an interview  over a month ago  that partnerships are their best way of scaling.
 Getting people involved from the beginning and having them influence how the program evolves is the best way we found to make things work wherever we are going, Bates said.
 The fact that Bitland here [in Uganda] is run by a Ugandan person, he knows the local culture, so he knows what peoples problems are.
 In May this year, Bitland Uganda was one of the startups that exhibited at the Africa Blockchain Conference. Something Edgar thinks is an achievement.
 They have also gone ahead and engaged both the ministry of lands as well as the lands commission according to Edgar. This is all happening at a time when land grabbing is a hot topic in the country.
 Related: How to use blockchain technology to unlock real estate potential in Uganda
 And Edgar believes that these problems can only be solved by an immutable, tamper-proof software that Bitland Uganda is building.
 [We] presented the solution before the Land Inquiry Commission chaired by Lady Justice Bamugemereire and the Minister of Lands, Housing, and Urban Devt, Hon. Betty Amongi, Edgar wrote in an email. And all are eager to work with Bitland Uganda.
 If the partnership with the ministry of lands is secured, then Bitland Uganda will be responsible for providing a software that will ensure no one can tamper with land titles and documents of land ownership anymore.
 The relationship with Ministry of Lands primarily will focus on providing a tamper-proof, immutable land registry software, if our potential partnership receives Government approval.
 Aside from the fact that no one will be able to tamper with the documents anymore, the government also stands to collect its fees with more ease. This will cut costs and also ensure more revenue is realized in the end.
 Through registration of private land on the Blockchain and when approved by Government, the solution makes it easier for Government to collect revenue through land registrations, stamp duty fees, and all other land registry fees.
 Besides Uganda, Bitland Global has so far spread its wings beyond Ghana into three other countries. Thats Nigeria, South Africa, and Mauritius. Though, in some, they are piloting.
 Bates also told me that Tanzania, Cameroon, and Rwanda are the next most likely expansions for Bitland Global.
 At the same time, they are also trying to avoid rapid expansion at the same time as it may have its own adverse effects.
 What we are trying to do is not get in the spot where we are overextending ourselves but also making sure that when we go into a place, the results are good. So that people dont say look, these people went into Rwanda and the results got worse'

"Africa and the Blockchain Revolution
","Theres definitely a blockchain revolution happening in Africa. In 2015, when I started my journey into blockchain and cryptocurrency in Africa, most people thought I had lost my mind. It was as if I spoke a medieval language, uttering words like “Hashing”, “Crypto”, “Blockchain”, and “Internet-level consensus.”
 Fast forward, three years later, and thousands of miles across the continent, the story is different. A growing community of people across the continent are as passionate about the blockchain revolution.
 People often ask for the reason for such radical change within a short time. My answer usually is that those who suffer the greatest pain need the doctor the most. Africa definitely needs the blockchain technology, and quickly at that.
 There are several issues on the continent; from poor governance, corruption, poverty, lack of transparency and a host of others. However, there is a strong can-do spirit on the continent, young entrepreneurs who with shoe-string budgets are keen to take on the world and make a difference. These are the ones that I say need the doctor the most.
 To be clear, Africa is still far from adopting blockchain technology. Central banks and other major financial institutions on the continent are yet to fully adopt the blockchain technology as at December 2017. But, the signs are very encouraging.
 
 Also read: Blockchain might render you Jobless or out of Business
 
 Central banks are studying the technology and running pilots at the moment. Commercial banks are beginning to ask the right questions and their decision makers have started to pay attention. Fintech companies are launching apps and integrating to various blockchain platforms.
 However, the vast majority are speculators who bet on the price movement of cryptocurrencies. This is understandable given the stupendous, mind-blogging growth rates of 30x, 300X, 3000X in the cryptocurrency world in 2017. A bull run on steroids!
 What will 2018 bring in the crypto-world? Same crypto-craziness as seen in 2017? or, would it be the calm after the storm? Opinions are divided on what 2018 will bring. Some financial experts expect the bull run to continue.
 The first few days of 2018 have not disappointed so far. Though the conservatives have begun to have flashbacks of the late 90s internet bubble. Yet, irrespective of the direction of cryptocurrency price levels, one thing is clear, the blockchain technology is here to stay. It can no longer be ignored.
 Savvy financial market players including central banks, commercial banks, remittance companies and fintech companies have realized that they can no more than stand on the sidelines and wait for things to unfold. They need to be active participants in the blockchain revolution. These firms have begun investigating what blockchain platform in the morass of blockchain platforms meets their needs and gives them the desired competitive advantage going into 2018 and beyond.
 Though a seemingly daunting task to pick the right blockchain, there are a number of parameters that will help serious institutions make the decision faster.
 First
 A blockchain must have a clear utility. In simple terms, the blockchain should actually solve a business problem. And, solve it better than existing solutions. Savvy institutions must be convinced that the blockchain they adopt solves a problem for them, as opposed to being a solution seeking a problem.
 Some problems currently being solved by blockchain include simplifying cross-border payments, streamlining trade financing and treasury management; enabling interoperability cross different financial platforms and a host of others. This is the Holy grail; if it does not solve a problem for you then it is a problem to you.
 Second
 The blockchain must have in-built compliance capabilities. The entire financial sector runs on compliance. So, if the blockchain does not offer that capability or if it is an add-on then it will inherently not address the requirements of serious players in the financial sector.
 
 Also read: Here’s how Blockchain technology is fixing what the internet had failed.
 
 Third
 Cost of a transaction is a major requirement. Transactions in Africa are quite high; in fact, it’s the most expensive region to send monies to and from. It’s a paradox that the poorest continent, lowest GDP/cap, pays the most for transactions. The blockchain has to be low cost (or preferably no-cost), just like the internet which is essentially free to use.
 Fourth
 The speed of transaction must be instant or near instant. It’s of no use having a blockchain where you have to wait minutes, hours or days for a transaction to be executed. Time is indeed money.
 Fifth
 A big barrier to adoption of most blockchains by central banks and financial institutions is that they are not comfortable with adopting cryptocurrencies that they have no control over.
 A key function of the central bank is to establish and implement monetary policies. So, with a cryptocurrency that they did not create, they are at a loss as to how they can control it. Hence, several central banks like the Bank of England, the UAE central bank etc. are looking to launch their own digital currencies.
 Sixth
 Scalability is the sixth consideration. This is non-negotiable, the blockchain must be able to scale, it must be able to compete with the likes of Visa, MasterCard and other global payment networks on a number of transactions processed per second.
 Seven
 Another requirement is a team behind the blockchain. They must be tried and tested. Financial players are custodians of millions and in some cases billions of dollars of other people’s money. So, it is extremely important that they deal with tried and tested players in the industry.
 Partnerships are being formed in the industry with established players such as IBM and others who have strong reputation for safety and security. These partnerships help assuage the concerns of financial market players.
 This is by no means an exhaustive list but it hopefully will help serious financial market players ask the right questions before adopting individual blockchain technologies.
 While 2017 was the year of the blockchain bull-run, 2018 will most likely be the year of the blockchain utility. Savvy African central banks, commercial banks, remittance companies and fintechs will not want to miss this opportunity to lead this new era of change.

"User Acquisition for an African tech startup: Doing it Right!
","The true measure of the value and influence of a tech startup is the number of users it has. As such, user acquisition strategies might be even more important than building a great product — should a product even be called great if it has no ability to suck users in?
 A few weeks ago, I found myself reading an article on User acquisition in an African context by Margaret Birungi — it highlights many of the challenges unique to the African market.
 Since then, I’ve focused on looking out for strategies tech startups all over the world have employed (with varying degrees of success) to try and grow their user base with the hope that I can come up with a comprehensive strategy of my own. Two weeks later, here I am, ready to share my findings.
 Before you can launch a strategy, you need to learn and accept a few things about the market (potential users):
 
 Nobody cares about your product! If you understand this, it will make your entry into the market a whole lot easier. You need to always remember that besides yourself, co-founders and your friends and family, no one really cares about whether your product succeeds or not. Keeping this at the back of your mind will push you to do all it takes to make them care and drive referrals.
 Not every user is an early adopter! I’ve seen many people who launch products with the misguided thought that everyone should want to try it early — NOT true! The spectrum of human personality dictates that some people will always have the urge to try out new things (and recommend the good ones to other people) whereas others always wait until everyone else is doing something before they can join the bandwagon. It’s your job to know who the early adopters are and target them with the hope to make them brand ambassadors.
 The first impression is forever! If you release your app and you’re lucky enough to have massive installs, you better make sure your app works flawlessly (if you’ve worked in tech before, you know that this is NEVER the case) because if it doesn’t, you’ll lose users, and you’ll lose them for life.
 
 Now that we have a glimpse into the inner workings of users’ minds, let’s delve into creating a comprehensive startup launching strategy that’ll ensure optimal user acquisition.
 Generate buzz for your product way ahead of time
 The reason companies like Samsung and Apple have managed to top the mobile phone sales charts in recent history is because they have perfected their use of the AIDA marketing model. AIDA stands for attention, interest, desire, and action. These tech giants develop communication strategies that effectively give the public a glimpse into what using their product will feel like.
 As a tech startup, it’s about time you started using this approach as well. Develop communication strategies that start conversations about your product way ahead of product launch:
 
 Get featured on tech news sites, tech blogs and conventional media like newspapers whenever possible. Tell anyone who will listen about your product…in the modern world, you blow your own trumpet!
 Invest in short videos that highlight what your product can do and how it does it.
 Send regular newsletters to your prospective users keeping them aware of your progress as well as your app’s features.
 Write a blog to give people a way to share your journey
 
 User acquisition should start long before product launch; if you start after your product has been perfected, you’re too late to the party!
 A “soft launch” is a must!
 The mistake that many tech startups make (especially in Uganda) is that as soon as they have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), they want to go all out and make sure everyone is using their product — WRONG!
 A soft launch is the release of a new product or service to a restricted audience or market in advance of a full launch.
 A soft launch is great because:
 
 It allows you to discover any product faults and fix them before the full launch. If you execute your soft launch well enough, users will know not to expect a perfect product and this means you won’t lose any users because of crashes/bugs.
 It helps you build trust with the participants as they take the journey to full launch with you. This is the first step towards building a community around your product.
 
 Create a community around your product
 This is a strategy the gaming industry has used effectively for decades. Companies like Konami, EA Sports and Ubisoft launch multiple game titles every year; for each of these, they have built a community of loyal fans who get the first crack at early game releases to give feedback to help improve the games before the full release.
 As a startup, you should work to build your community of super fans and make sure you involve them in the development process — this makes them feel appreciated while you get valuable feedback at no cost. Win-Win!
 The members of this community will become your brand ambassadors and will drive numerous installs via referrals.
 Social media is your friend
 As a startup, chances are high that you do not have enough money to run an effective advertising campaign via conventional media (newspapers, Tv and radio). In my opinion, conventional media isn’t that great anyway because it’s a one-way communication channel. As such, you should invest in social media, which is quickly becoming a more versatile way to get your message out there.
 Social media gives you the power to start conversations and engage your users. However, social media could be your downfall, so you should keep a few things in mind;
 
 Respond to all user engagement (likes, comments, DM’s, retweets, quotes, Messages…everything!). Whenever a user takes time to do any of the above (whether positive or negative), it’s out of love. If a user complains about your product, it’s because they want it to be better. How you handle these correspondences has the power to create loyal fans (referrers) for your company.
 Invest in increasing your post/tweet reach. Make sure your posts are seen by as many people as possible, as often as possible.
 Keep your social media accounts active
 Always be courteous and thankful.
 
 Referrals are the key to exponential growth
 
 Your early adopters will play a key role in the future uptake of your product — this makes them your most important user group.
 A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is — it is what consumers tell each other it is.
 Scott Cook, co-founder, Intuit
 How many referrals you get will be determined by how well you execute all the other strategies mentioned above.
 Referrals are the ultimate growth strategy; as a tech startup, it is your job to make sure that people have only great things to say about your brand. Brands have personalities too, and if your brand isn’t likeable, then people will not recommend it.
 A referral Vs. An advert
 The difference between a referral and an advert is clear for all to see. When a friend tells another to try this new app because it’s really fun, chances are that the other person will download it without looking for more info about it.
 If another person sees an ad, say on the internet, they will most likely first google it, and look for reviews, number of downloads etc. In this case the user can very easily opt not to download it.
 Ultimately, referrals have an almost 100% conversion rate; adverts languish in the lower tenth percentile.
 Conclusion
 When you start building your product, you should simultaneously start the all-important quest of user acquisition. How well you do on this quest is what’ll classify you as a great, mediocre or forgettable startup.

"Uber continues with expansion across Africa. Next stop is Mauritius
","Uber is expanding to Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation known for its beaches, lagoons, and reefs. That is according to a job advert on the companys website. Uber is looking for an individual, whose title is Country Lead. They will be charged with the operations as well as the launch of Uber in Mauritius.
 Uber is now making five years since it first launched in Africa in August 2013, with Johannesburg as their first city. Yet, in the period, it has expanded to 8 African countries with Mauritius now the 8th.
 The other 8 countries are; South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Morocco, and Egypt. Though, in February this year, they suspended operations in Morocco after two years as it tries to bring its business into line with local laws.
 In November last year, Reuters reported that Uber was planning an expansion into more African countries. They were looking for new markets in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, and the wider southern African region.
 Though Justin Spratt, head of business development for the sub-Saharan region, told Reuters that they had not yet taken a decision on where to go next.

 I thought it was ridiculous that Uber was considering entering a market of 12 million people when there are other markets that have way more.

"Here&#8217;s how Blockchain technology is fixing what the internet had failed.
","Do you think the internet has changed the world? You havent seen a thing, yet. The technology behind the internet is evolving progressively into something bigger and extremely powerful. Thats if we keep gaining grounds in developing the Blockchain Technology.
 Before I dive deep into what Blockchain is, let me revise your memory about how the technology behind the internet works. The basic concept of internet technology works like this;
 Supposing John in Kampala creates his information  his can be text, video, pictures or audio  using a computer and wants anyone in the world to read or interact with it. What does he have to do? 
 He will connect his computer to a network of computers around the world. And, as long as anyone in the world has a computer connected to the network s/he will interact with Johns information. But, to enable the exchange of information across that network there two set of rules  call them protocols, that were invented;
 
 TCP/IP protocol; defines the rules how information should be exchanged between John and the world.
 HTTP protocol; defines how the information should be retrieved
 
 Now, John can do Ninja tricks creating his information equally the world can do Kungfu tricks interacting with this information.  Nobody really cares. BUT, what is the most important are the two rules or protocols that must be followed no matter what. There you have it. The internet you always use and even right now reading this.
 But, there are two fundamental inventions that happened to make the internet possible;
 
 The computer that enabled us to create digital information that can be exchanged
 TCP/IP and HTTP protocols or the rules
 
 Until recently, the internet technology had just delivered us to the Information Age. Yet humans are powered to build a lot of innovations on top of this technology. Which in the end makes the world become a better place. Just take a look at how big internet companies have become and the amount of power they have in the world.
 However, this internet technology has failed to deliver us to the true Digital revolution. Just like Industrial and Agricultural Revolutions. Even though it has perfectly helped us fix the problem of how we create digital information, deliver and retrieve it.
 
 Read also: Bitcoin is currently useless for remittances to Uganda – Asindu Willfred
 
 The technology had failed to fix these problems especially;
 
 How to trust each other: There is absolutely no way I can truly trust the person on the other end unless some trusted party is in the picture. These third parties have created insane income inequality in the world. Imagine one man called Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is worth over $105 Billion  richer than over 25 African countries combined by GDP estimates.
 Exchange of valuable assets across the network: Every information on the internet is a copy of the original. If you take a picture with your phone and upload it to Facebook? Facebook will make a copy, and you keep the original. Likewise, when you send a message, the receiver will just read the copy of your original message. Which you have reminded with. Literally, the internet is one gigantic photocopying machine. There is no way to send original information and not keep a copy. This is a big problem. Which implies that theres absolutely no way I can send a valuable asset over the internet.
 
 But, imagine you want to transfer ownership of valuable asset called music track? And, that transfer to happen, it must be on the internet. It is important that you give me the original and to never stay with the copy.
 One other reason it has been difficult or impossible to achieve that is the existence of information tempering or hacking. Currently, the trusted parties  call them brokers, spend an unimaginable amount of money protecting the information online. And most times fail miserably.
 Therefore, the current internet technology has not delivered us to digital revolution as people may think. Thats why most people are still struggling to make the internet valuable to them. Apart from third parties who are minting billions from it.
 This is where the exciting Blockchain technology comes in. So what is Blockchain?
 Imagine thousands of interconnected computers holding blocks of data. These Blocks contain information about a valuable thing. Every few minutes, new blocks are added to the network. But, first, those blocks go through a powerful mathematical verification process. This is done by people called miners. Once added to the network, the block is time-stamped encrypted to never be changed  forever. 
 Those blocks stay forever on that network with a name called Public Ledger. And finally, they are publically accessed. Blocks can be grouped. For example, the current trending currency blocks like Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchain.
 Blockchain technology creates a one-on-one trusted exchange of valuable information over a network with no trusted third party needed. Something the internet cant do, currently.
 Assuming you want to sell your phone to John. But, to release your phone, you will need something valuable to enable you to make another transaction to get something else. John will give you money. You trust the money because you trust the Central Bank. And, you know someone else will trust it if you want to get something else.
 What if there is a way you can back your transaction between you and John without involving the Central Bank? Thats Blockchain.
 The block transaction between you and John is created. It goes through verification procedure and gets accepted into the network a.k.a public ledger. Which implies this transaction is permanently saved on the network and will never be changed. John can then use that block transaction to purchase something else. Hence eliminating the Central Bank completely. As you can see, the banking industry is in trouble to be irrelevant. 
 But, it isnt only the Banking industry. Its almost everyone who earns his or her bread as a trusted third party between two people. They are poised to become irrelevant to the rise of this technology. Right now, the world is just piloting Blockchain with currencies like Bitcoin. If this becomes a success, then (Central) Banks will be replaced forever. Unless they re-invent themselves to ride with the tide.
 Humans are now more advanced to need third-party policing in order to trust each other. What they need is more value from the internet. Something more than just copied information seated on (Google) servers.
 The Blockchain is delivering us from information age, beyond Facebook and Google, into the valuable age. Where true value is exchanged to create meaningful human impact. The Blockchain is removing powers from the few people to the public.  Or at least it seems like that.

"Goodwell Investments announces new $23M fund for sub-saharan Africa
","The Netherlands based Goodwell Investments has announced the launch of a new fund. Goodwell Investments has launched a new EUR 20 million (around $23 million) fund, they wrote. This fund will go to investments in the inclusive economy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 According to Goodwell, the aim is to meet the growing demand for impact investments from private investors, family offices, and foundations.
 Additionally, it follows the many investor requests they received following the closure of its predecessor fund earlier this year.
 Also read: Nigeria’s Tizeti raises $3M to expand its wifi to other African countries
 Dubbed Goodwell IV, the fund will look to achieve maximum social impact. Like its predecessors, they will be looking for fast-growing companies.
 Founded in 2005, Goodwell Investments has raised 5 different funds. Altogether, the funds have an estimation of $100 million.
 Half of the new fund will go to financial services according to Goodwell. Because the financial sector is the driving force behind a thriving local economy. The rest will go to agriculture, health and sanitation, energy, and transport.
 
 There is a specific focus on technology-driven solutions because technology, especially on the vast African continent, enables businesses to reach more consumers faster and at much lower cost.
 
 Goodwells past investments have been equity tagged with a strong emphasis on early-stage startups in India and Africa.
 On their website, they list that they have made investments in at least 25 companies. The fund participated in Pagas (Nigeria) both series A and B.
 While Nomanini (South Africa) and Musoni Systems (pan-African), Oradian (Nigeria) and WhereIsMyTransport (pan-African) are among their other portfolio companies.
 In April this year, Goodwell participated in MFS Africas (South Africa) $4.5 million Series B that was led by LUN Partners Group as well as Lidyas (Nigeria) $6.9 million series B in May this year.

"Edtech startup, Fundi Bots, has secured additional funding
","Solomon King Benge, the Founder of Fundi Bots, has announced that the edtech startup has raised more grant funding. It gives me great joy to officially announce that Fundi Bots has a new funding partner, Solomon wrote on his LinkedIn.
 When I contacted him, Solomon declined to disclose the funding amount as well as the funder. I can not disclose that because it is part of the terms of the agreement, he told me.
 Though upon insistence, he informed me that it is a grant and the funding partner is US-based. We are a non-profit, so all our funding is grant, Solomon said.
 Currently with operations  in form of outreaches  in Northern Uganda, according to Solomon, this will go to strengthening that.
 Over the next 12 months, this funding will allow us to open up a fully functional Fundi Space in Gulu to solidify our presence and extend our outreach to even more schools in Northern Uganda, he wrote.
 He is also looking to strengthen another arm of Fundi Bots thats focused on girls called Fund Girls.
 We are going to increase our Fundi Girls outreach which has been going on. But this is going to allow us to engage more female teachers, engage more girls in school.
 They will also now focus on expanding into Western Uganda as well as exploring a new curriculum.
 Additionally, we’ll begin our outreach to Western Uganda (hooray!). Most importantly, we’ll also embark on the next – and most critical – phase of our work, the Fundi Bots Enhanced Science Curriculum.
 Founded in 2011, Fundi Bots has been mainly grants funded. In fact, Solomon told me that he was only able to start full operations in 2014 after securing grant funding from Echoing Green and Ashoka.
 Also read: Rwanda’s Paul Kagame gives a go-ahead to Andela’s partnership proposal
 Echoing Green granted him US $40,000 per year for two years. While Ashokas was a personal stipend, as he called it, to allow him as a fellow to focus on [Fundi Bots] work.
 Beyond Uganda, the startup is exploring the possibility of extending their operations to Rwanda and Tanzania.
 [In] Tanzania, we have a partner and [in] Rwanda we are exploring [possible] partnerships, Solomon told me. Though, they are still going back and forth with training as well  especially in Tanzania.
 We provide the tools, robotics, we provide assistance and more. But these two are not at a stage where I can say we have a presence [in Tanzania].
 Being a not-for-profit venture, I was curious to understand how they are planning to address the future financial sustainability challenges. We do generate revenue even though we are not a for-profit, Solomon said.
 Though he admitted that sustainability is a question that can only be answered in the long-run.
 Sustainability is a long-term play. So we are looking at different options. Part of it is working with schools that pay for our program and then we use that money to do outreach to the less privileged schools.

"Facebook Invites Ugandan-based Software Developers to its Challenge
","On Friday evening, Facebook organized a Bot Party at Outbox, a Ugandan Hub for startups and software developers. This was the second Bot Party to be organized by Facebook on the African Continent after the one in Malawi which took place on Saturday  February 25, 2017  at mHub. The next Bot party took place today in Kenya at Moringa School. The parties are aimed at creating hype about the Bots for Messenger Challenge.
 
 Of over 20 hubs in Africa and M. East taking part in the @facebook Bot Party, mHub will be the first to host the event #messengerchallenge
 — mHub Malawi (@mHubMW) February 24, 2017
 
 Bots for Messenger Challenge is a contest to recognize and reward developers who are able to create the most innovative new bots on Messenger. Applicants for the challenge must be from either the Middle East and North Africa or Sub-Saharan Africa.
 Timothy Asiimwe, the CTO &amp; Co-founder at Panya Bot – a Ugandan messenger chat bot that one can use for shopping, receiving news etc – made a presentation on what a developer can do on the messenger platform to ease user experience. Timothy also presented additional resources provided by Facebook like messaging tools, templates, menus etc. He later took the developers through a step by step guide on how to create a messenger bot – preparing them for the Bots for messenger challenge.

 Proud Dzambukira, from Facebook South Africa, also took the developers through Facebook for developers and later on held a question and answer session with the developers to ensure they were well versed with the entire process.
 Application to the challenge was opened on February 15, 2017 and will close on April 28, 2017. The Bots to be considered for the challenge should fall in either Gaming and Entertainment, Productivity and Utility or Social Good category. Teams of up to 3 people are invited to participate in the Challenge.
 30 finalist teams from each region  10 from each category, to make a total of 60 finalists  will win a Gear VR and mobile phone, one hour of Facebook mentorship, and up to $40,000 USD in tools and services from FbStart  a Facebook program designed to help early stage mobile startups build and grow their bots.
 Student teams or individual student entrants who shall make it to the finals will win an additional $2,000 USD. Student will be verified against their registration via their government accredited school email accounts.
 3 runner up teams  1 from each category  runner up teams for each region will win $10,000 USD and 3 months of Facebook mentorship. The 3 winning teams -1 from each category  for each region will win $20,000 USD and 3 months of Facebook mentorship.
 When we asked Proud – on a one-on-one – how Ugandan students and developers can increase their chances of going through the application process, he urged them to make use of the available resources.
 Leverage all the resources available. Leverage outbox and Richard (Zulu, the Founder of Outbox). He has made himself available to anyone interested  Proud Dzambukira
 However, there has been a growing concern that competitions are not doing much to groom the next generation of Ugandan entrepreneurs. Instead young developers and entrepreneurs are looking at them as a way to make quick money. When asked why he thinks this will be different, Proud said it’s because they’re encouraging entrepreneurs to build products that address people’s needs.

"Senegal&#8217;s Shopmeaway Raises $100k From State-Supported Startup Fund
","Shopmeaway, a tech-enabled logistics company, provides delivery services for customers in Senegal who order from international online stores. The company is one of four startups selected in the inaugural cohort for Délégation Générale à lEntreprenariat Rapide, a new initiative implemented by the government of Senegal in 2018 to support entrepreneurs in the country.
 Currently making deliveries in Dakar for online orders that were shipped to Shopmeaway offices in the United States, France and China, the investment of 65 million FCFA (approximately 113,000 $) will fuel the expansion of the logistics service to additional cities, implementation of new features for the Shopmeaway website and launch of Click &amp; Collect, a new e-commerce platform for local SMEs across Senegal that will allow users to search for products by region.
 “I am very happy about our new Click &amp; Collect platform. It will give small artisanal producers access to a
 broader market. The synergies with Shopmeaway on the last mile deliveries and payment processing for these smaller suppliers will boost both our activities,” says Racine Sarr, Shopmeaway CEO and Co-
 Founder.
 Founded in 2015 by Sarr, Chimere Diouf and Amadi Cissé, Shopmeaway has bootstrapped its way to profitable traction with more than 6,500 orders in 2018, including from Amazon, which accounts for about a third of the orders received from Shopmeaway customers.
 For 2019, using data and analytics collected from past orders, Shopmeaway plans to improve the ordering and reorder process for users and build strategic partnerships that will aid the expansion.
 ABOUT SHOPMEAWAY

"This micro VC has injected over $3.5M into 8 African startups in under a year
","Often times, African startup founders cite access to funding among the top challenges they face when trying to bring their ideas to life. Yet, over time, the African continent is seeing more and more investors willing to back startups headquartered or focused on the continent.
 Last year, according to CrunchBase data, there were at least 50 Africa-focused VCs. However, the article from TechCrunch also noted the growing number of local micro VCs.
 As the name suggests, micro VCs are relatively small in size and also write relatively small ticket sizes usually ranging from $50,000 to $1 million. The primary objective for these is to “clean up” really early-stage startups and create a deal pipeline for early venture or late venture investors.
 In Africa, there’s been a growing number of these micro VC’s with the most notable ones being Microtraction and Ventures Platform. The two, in the past 12 months, have been extremely active with a combined total of 15 investments.
 Saviu Ventures, a Mauritius-incorporated micro venture capital firm, launched in 2017 with the aim of bridging the gap that exists when it comes to African startups ready to absorb Series A funding.
 “This is our value proposition: we want to help entrepreneurs reach series A but also provide later-stage funds access a qualified deal flow of startups that have gone through our methods and our care,” said Arthur Thuet, co-founder and Managing Partner at Saviu Ventures.
 Arthur started Saviu Ventures with Benoit Delestre as a way to help African startups not only raise funding but also put a couple of structures in place during their first months of existence. They chose to create a micro-VC structure because they knew there was a real need and that their combined experiences would be highly valuable for young entrepreneurs.
 “We have more of an entrepreneurial background which is an asset when investing in young startups who face many issues that require quick and efficient answers”, Arthur pointed out.
 Unlike other investors that are set out on the onset to build a VC firm, Saviu Ventures was launched in a somewhat unorthodox way.
 In 2015, Arthur joined Jumia Group in Kenya where he worked as an intern in the logistics department. It was from here that he says he was able to understand the innings and workings of a startup, especially one that has operations across Africa.
 “I was involved in logistics and operations [at Jumia] which I think still helps me a lot right now with the startups that we are working with, especially as we are building a strong vertical in transportation”, Arthur says.
 After quitting Jumia Group and a few other tech-related experiences in Africa, he launched Saviu by making two seed Agtech investments and co-creating a logistics startup in Ivory Coast with Délas N’dri  Kamtar  a platform that connects informal truck drivers with expeditors and develops a network of pick-up stations for parcels throughout the country.
 This was a way to lay a ground for Arthur and Benoit to see how the entire process of starting and building a successful startup in Africa works. “For us, this was some kind of pilot phase to show potential investors that we actually knew how to start a startup on the continent, how to help it improve overall, increase revenue and take it to the next level”.
 It did not take long before they convinced new investors that they could replicate their first experiences with other startups.“ We raised additional funding from a Mauritian private equity fund and entrepreneurs from Europe and Africa to grow the portfolio to 10 companies in both French-speaking and English-speaking Africa”, Arthur explains.
 Instead of raising a fund and then look around for the startups to inject it into, the pair decided to go forth with an open-ended fund that is dependent on a supply-driven approach which gives them the agility and flexibility they are looking for.
 In the past year, Saviu Ventures has made 8 investments for a total amount of $3.5 million. 5 of these investments  which represent $2 million of the total capital deployed  happened in the last four months. The tickets have ranged anywhere from $50.000 to $850.000.
 Their current portfolio includes companies like Talent2Africa, a human resources startup specialised in recruitment and sourcing for talent as well as Afrikrea.com, a fashion startup based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast which provides a platform that one can use to discover, buy and sell Made Of Africa fashion, art and crafts from all over the world.
 Although Arthur maintains that they have their eyes fixated on sub-Saharan Africa, he points out that they have a soft spot for those in Francophone Africa, which makes sense given that both co-founders hail from France.
 “English-speaking Africa is full of ambitious entrepreneurs and talented investors, it is an exciting and crowded market where we, as investors, must have a footprint. The Venture Capital scene in French-speaking Africa is a bit young but catching up quickly, this is why we see it as a great opportunity”.
 As entrepreneurs and investors in francophone Africa, Arthur and Benoit are looking forward to the day these countries will have the same level of digital vibrancy. “The ecosystem is becoming more and more exciting, and investors will start looking at those countries more carefully”, says Arthur.
 According to Arthur, ever since they launched, they have been inspired to actually get bigger. “We have excellent feedback from the market,” he says. “Whether it is from entrepreneurs who are happy to see more seed investors who provide operational assistance on the market or series A investors who know this will be a good thing for their deal flow, we have the feeling that we are doing something relevant”.

"Angel investment in Africa is still nascent, but there are some milestones
","A 2012 report by Omidyar Network called for initiating, expansion and formalization of local Angel Investment in Africa. This was “ to ensure the availability of the most appropriate type of funding for startups.” Six years later, the continent seems to have heeded the advice.
 Currently, according to Africa Business Angel Networks, ABAN, there are over 60 Angel Networks in Africa. In fact, there are some other Africa-focused Angel Networks beyond the continent’s borders.
 Recently, Tanzania also launched its own Angel Investment Network, TAIN. While Kampala, Uganda’s capital also saw KAIN become the latest addition to the growing number of Angel Networks last year. (See also: Why we are Building an Angel investment Network in Uganda)
 But, while as ABANs team believes that angel investing in the continent is still nascent, it sure is a time to look back at some of the key milestones.
 Because Africa has reached a stage where launching shouldn’t be the news. Rather, what impact a particular network is having. Attention should be fixated on the ultimate aim of the Angel Network and what it is doing to get there. There are those that have so far, already, proved that its possible.
 Founded in 2012, Cairo Angels has become one of the leading investors in Egypt. As well as the MENA region. Just behind 500 Startups Middle East.
 Last year, they participated in four different rounds of funding. Here, here, and here. Playing the lead role in two of them. To date, according to its website, the network has invested over US $2.2 Million in 21 startups across 6 cities.
 In January, this year, Cairo Angels joined forces with EG Bank to the Mint Incubator. A “highly competitive” three-month incubation programme with no equity.
 In Nigeria, Lagos Angel Network, LAN, one of the pioneer Networks on the continent, was founded in 2012. Since then, according to the Network’s CrunchBase profile, it has gone on to make at least four deals.
 It made its very first investments in Autobox and Hutbay in 2014. Followed by a $250,000 investment in both Big Cabal Media and Cafe Neo.
 From then, the Network has continued to hold Masterclasses as well as DealDays. Through this, the network, Tomi Davies, its founder, believes that it exposes the Angels to individual entrepreneurs and ventures. According to Disrupt Africa, “companies have so far raised over NGN200 million (US$555,000) via the events.”
 On an individual level, Nigeria has had some few individuals, especially former and current founders, come out to invest as Angels. And, go ahead to make such deals public. Something still rare amongst African Angel Investors.
 Tomi Davies, long before he founded the Lagos Angel Network, was investing as an individual. He’s invested around US$1.2 million into startups including Sproxil, Pass.ng, SimplePay, PushCV and Pledge 51, generally putting between US$25,000 and US$50,000 into each startup per round, according to Disrupt Africa.
 Others that have followed in Tomi’s footsteps are Paga’s Tayo Oviosu. He has invested in ChopUp. Konga’s founder, Sim Shagaya, with his investment in Go My Way and Jovago (now Jumia Travel) founder, Marek Zmyslowki also join the list.
 In East Africa, there are a couple of networks. According to ABAN, the number ranges between 5  10. However, there hasnt’ been much activity from them, until recently, beyond meetups and investor master classes.
 According to ABANs David van Dijk, “Kenyan angel network ‘Viktoria’ celebrated its first investment” last year. Viktoria Ventures was also among the three investors that invested in the three winners at the 4th Angels Fair Africa event in Nairobi.
 While Uganda’s Kampala Angel Investment Network, KAIN, held its first Investor Meetup early this year and a DealDay in April. (See also: KAIN partners with Investment Clubs to invest between $10k – $100k in Uganda’s early-stage startups)
 Though, Tomi commented on the issue of angel networks not being active yet. He said, in reference to LAN, that;
 
 “It’s very early days for LAN to talk about exits in the classical western sense and there is a view that the western form of exits will not be what happens here on the African continent as infrastructure, commercial culture and expected outcomes differ from that of the West we are trying to emulate.”
 
 There are a couple of startups that have raised angel investment from individual Angel Investors. But, few  if any  make such information public.
 For example, Xente, a fintech startup in Uganda has raised some “significant” amount of funding from Angel Investors. Kenneth Legesi, one of the founders of Kampala Angel Investment Network has also made some bets in startups in Uganda.
 Towards the end of last year, Africa Entrepreneurship Angels also held a closed-door Angel Investor pitching session in Kampala. But, no further details of deals made were communicated. (See also: Why BMCE’s AEAwards launched an Angel Investors Network, African Entrepreneurship Angels)
 While, Angel Africa List, founded in 2013 as “an early stage Pan African investment platform”, has also held Angels Fair Africa since 2013.
 The event, according to its website, has “resulted in $23M worth of investments in the KINGS countries of Kenya, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa.”
 Beyond the borders of the continent, Sean Obedih founded NewGenAngels. A “members-only investment Club for high liquid professionals and sophisticated angels, Ultra High Net Worth Individuals, venture capital firms, family offices and angel networks with an interest in Africa.”
 The network, as of 2014, had made syndicated investments into 3 African startups totaling US $200,000. This was into “music startup Orin, US$25,000 into online marketplace Kitaal and US$150,000 into a stealth financial technology company. According to Disrupt Africa.
 Before being acquired by a UK-based advisory firm, CAMSCORP, for an undisclosed fee, in February last year.

"These are the 8 topics that shaped Africa&#8217;s startup ecosystem in the first half of 2019
","The first half of 2019 has been a good one for African startups. As the continent continues to build towards a more robust ecosystem, there were events that took place which shall be looked back upon and seem monumental in building the continent. In this write-up, we take you back through H1 and capture what we think are the most relevant topics.
 1. Increasing accelerator activity
 In April, Founders Factory Africa announced the admission of the first five African fintech startups into their accelerator. These were: Schoolable and Eazyhire (Nigeria), LipaLater (Kenya), Kudigo (Ghana), and Digest Africa (Uganda). The corporate-backed accelerator with its origins from London launched in Johannesburg in October last year with the backing of Africa’s largest banking group Standard Bank. They also followed this by launching a new program focused on healthcare and pharma startups across Africa with the backing of South African firm Netcare. The accelerator’s plan is to back as well as build a total of 140 companies in its lifetime.
 Antler, a global “startup generator” and early-stage VC, also launched in Kenya where it plans to build and fund more than 40 tech companies in the next 3 years. Founded in 2017 by Magnus Grimeland, co-founder of Zalora, Antler has held “successful” programs in Singapore and Stockholm, and are now replicating this success by expanding to Africa, London, Amsterdam, and Sydney. It started its East African operations across Kenya and Ethiopia and is looking to accommodate at least 40 “future founders”, and to have a minimum of 16 startups to invest $100,000 every year in Nairobi. In exchange for the investment, Antler would take a 20% equity stake in each startup. 
 2. Funds closed/announced
 French investor Partech doubled down on the African continent by closing its oversubscribed Partech Africa Fund of $143 million. The firm had announced the first close of the fund early in 2018. They also went ahead and opened up their second African office in Nairobi, following the one in Dakar. The Partech Africa Fund plans to make 20-25 investments across roughly 10 African countries exploring all sectors, over the next several years according to General Partner Tidjane Deme. It will primarily target Series A and B investments and some pre-series rounds at higher dollar amounts in the $500,000 range.
 Emerging markets startup competition Seedstars also announced in April the launch of its hefty $100 million Africa fund in collaboration with Paris-based First Growth Ventures. The announcement was made by Seedstars World Chief Investment Officer Charlie Graham-Brown at the Seedstars Summit held on 5th April. The Africa-focused fund will become Seedstars’ first such regional fund. Similar to Partech’s, Seedstars Africa Fund is also dedicated to investments at the early venture [Series A and Series B] stage. Their ticket sizes will range from $250,000 to $5 million according to Graham-Brown.
 Tunisia-based private equity firm AfricInvest also teamed up with French investor Cathay Innovation in April to launch a new Africa tech fund with a target raise of $168 million. The fund will primarily focus on Series A to Series C stage investments across Fintech, Logistics, AI, Agtech, and Edtech companies. In January, an early-stage investment fund for African startups Oui Capital announced its $10 million fund for pre-series A tech companies valued at or below $5 million from Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. The venture fund will invest in fintech, mobility, healthcare, and education companies, and simultaneously offer mentorship services from experts. 
 Lastly, Naspers Foundry, a $300 million fund that was launched last year by Naspers, made its very first deal with a $2 million investment in South African cleaning service startup SweepSouth. 
 3. European Governments are coming
 In March, French President Emmanuel Macron, during a 3-day trip to Africa to boost trade with Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Kenya, announced that his country had set up an investment fund earmarked for equity investment in startups and SMEs. The $2.8 billion funds will go towards financing and supporting Africa startups and SMEs by 2022 through their Choose Africa initiative. The initiative would see the government supporting about 10,000 enterprises across the continent by providing credit, technical support, and equity financing. 
 The German government followed suit in June when the German ambassador to Ghana Christoph Retzlaff announced a $1.1Billion Africa fund. Through the fund, the German government is looking to support African startups and small businesses, as well as German and European companies that are Africa focused. The fund is in fulfillment of the pledge made by the German Chancellor Angella Merkel during the G20 Compact With Africa initiative which was launched under Germany’s G20 presidency in 2017 to promote investment in Africa. At least 12 African countries form part of the initiative so far  Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Senegal, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Ethiopia and Rwanda  and are the ones likely to benefit.
 4. Ride-hailing startups are feeling the VC love
 One of the major updates in the ride-hailing startup market was Egypt’s Swvl raising a whopping $42 million Series C in June. The mass transit startup’s round was led by Vostok New Ventures. This round brought Swvl’s total funding to at least $80.5 million across 4 different funding rounds.
 In Nigeria, MAX.ng also received $7 million in funding from Novastar Ventures, Yamaha, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Zrosk Investment Management, and Alitheia Capital. According to the company’s press release, $6 million of the investment came in as equity capital making up their Series A while the remaining $1 million was a grant. Another of Nigeria’s motorcycle-hailing apps, Gokada, raised $5.3Million in a Seed A round led by Rise Capital and joined by Adventure Capital, IC Global Partners, and Illinois-based First MidWest Group to grow its transit business. 
 To finance their expansion efforts to Nigeria, Ugandan motorcycle-hailing startup SafeBoda raised an undisclosed Series B round in May that was co-led by Allianz X and Go-Jek’s investment arm GO-Ventures. This round of funding came after SafeBoda had initially raised a $1.1 million Series A funding last year that Digest Africa reported on. 
 5. Future of transportation in Africa
 Global ride-hailing giant Uber announced plans to dabble into boat hailing services in Nigeria’s economic hub Lagos. The company made this announcement immediately after two other Nigerian startups  Gokada and Max.ng  had already relayed their boat-hailing services plans. 
 However, of all the three players, Uber is the entrant with experience offering the service elsewhere. The ride-hailing company pointed out early in the year that they had already tested and launched the service in Mumbai, India over the first few months of 2019. According to the company, they see water transportation developing into a core offering alongside other public transit systems. 
 6. Mega rounds
 Andela received a whopping $100 million in a Series D round led by Generation Investment Management with participation from existing investors including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GV (Google Ventures), Spark Capital, and CRE Venture Capital. This round brought Andela’s total funding to $174.61 million over 5 rounds. It also pushed the company among Africa’s most capitalized startups.
 In May, mobile health payments platform CarePay International also raised $44.9million in a Series A round to expand into new markets. The Amsterdam and Nairobi-based company was launched in Kenya in 2015 as a partnership with mobile operator Safaricom, and this is its first funding round, led by Elma Investments, IFHA, and PharmAccess Foundation. The round ranks among Africa’s highest Series A rounds.
 7. Exits
 In April, African e-commerce giant Jumia officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It opened with its shares trading at $14.50 under the ticker symbol JMIA. This came as a significant win for Jumia’s major shareholder MTN Group who had long been reported to be looking to exit the startup. 
 Usually, startups are acquired by the more established firms. However, in H1 2019, six-year-old Ghanaian startup mPharma acquired Kenya’s second-largest pharmacy chain Haltons, with an estimated worth of $5 million. It also saw the participation of Nairobi-based Novastar Ventures. The startup took control of Haltons from Fanisi Capital, a Mauritius-based private equity firm, but senior management at Haltons will retain a piece of the pie in the business. 
 MPharma manages prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers, and now, entered the East African regional market. The acquisition added 20 Halton stores to the startups portfolio that is now split between Nairobi and Mombasa. The deal came in motion as mPharma worked on completing a $12 million Series B funding round led by 4DX Ventures, an Accra and San Francisco based VC firm.
 8. What makes a startup African?
 The announcement of Jumia as “Africa’s first tech startup to be listed on the NYSE”  in April sparked a continent-wide debate on what actually makes a startup “African”. While the company runs the largest e-commerce business across Africa with operations in 14 countries, it was founded by two French nationals, incorporated in Germany with its headquarters in Dubai. Jumia’s technology and engineering team is based in Portugal and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  So, the question remains: What makes a startup African?
 Ventureburn ran a series of stories on the topic in a bid to answer the question. Digest Africa CEO and co-founder Peter Kisadha was also among the people the South Africa publication interviewed on the topic. He pointed out that it’s not easy to classify whether a startup is African or not because of globalization. “It is therefore not easy to classify whether a startup is African, given how easy it is for a company to now distribute itself across the globe,” he said. 
 However, at Digest Africa, we rely on a methodology that focuses on only three things: where the economic value of that startup’s existence falls. We are able to come to a conclusion regarding that by studying two things; if a startup is either headquartered in Africa or has the continent as its primary or only market, it qualifies as an African startup.

"Learn more about the 5 tech startup investments by EWB Ventures in Africa
","EWB Ventures is an arm of Engineering Without Borders established in 2013. The goal was to invest in innovative startup businesses across sub-Saharan Africa. EWB Ventures in Africa has so far made a couple of investments.
 They have invested in at least 7 startups across Sub-Saharan Africa. That’s Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Zambia  to be specific. They recently opened an office in Uganda and are looking to continue investing up to $100,000.
 See also: EWB Ventures sets up shop in Kampala, to invest up to $100,000
 If you are considering approaching them, we thought it would be wise if you took a look at their current portfolio.
 Important to note is that they do provide a startup with early (seed) stage financing  which is usually equity. Though the package is rarely cash only. Part of it comes in form of talent and advisory support as Rithu Rajan said in an interview last year.
 “Apart from financial investment, we also provide talent and advisory support,” she said.
 Here is a close look at their portfolio and what exactly EWB Ventures brought to the table.
 LishaBora
 This is a Kenyan startup “digitizing the operations of dairy farmers” in rural Kenya. Though currently in Kenya, they harbor an ambition of expanding across East Africa.
 “LishaBora is the only startup company in Kenya working directly with dairy traders in the informal market, the startup says.
 They partner with these dairy farmers who in turn sell its products like dairy feeds and forage. These also use their business management app to help them keep track of their finances.
 This, in turn, enables the dairy farmers to build a financial track record.
 Founded in 2015, by Graham Benton, LishaBora says that “there are over two million smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya spending 1.5 billion USD annually on dairy feeds.”
 They have a multi-pronged revenue model. It combines earnings from the mobile app, milk offtake as well as distribution of other products.
 They participated in Hardware Africa by Village Capital in 2015 and Unreasonable East Africas 2016 fellowship. This year, they were part of Disrupt Africas Pitch Competition.
 Rent to Own
 Rent to Own is a Zambian micro-asset financing company founded in 2009 by Mark Hemsworth. They “provide high-impact assets to micro-entrepreneurs in rural Zambia.
 To support Rent to Own EWB reinforced the venture in its founding-stage by embedding Five Long-Term Fellows and eight Junior Fellows.
 Rent to own later secured its first round of investment in 2012.
 FarmDrive
 FarmDrive offers financial services to smallholder farmers in Kenya. The startup uses mobile phones, alternative data, and machine learning to achieve that.
 EWB Ventures provided an undisclosed amount of seed financing to the startup.
 “To spark FarmDrive’s growth, we secured seed funding in the founding-stage,” EWB wrote.
 The startup was founded in 2014 by Rita Kimani and Peris Bosire. Last year, they raised follow-on funding from Safaricoms Spark Venture Fund.
 Viamo (VOTO Mobile)
 Viamo, called VOTO Mobile, is an enterprise and ICT4D solution. It seeks to connect organizations and governments institution to hard to reach areas.
 It was founded in 2012 in Accra Ghana, by Mark Boots, Louis Dorval, and Levi Goertz. They currently have operations in over 29 countries across the globe.
 EWB Ventures provided early-stage investment in Viamo. This was used to carry out the early developments of the product.
 “We partnered to play a foundational role in the early development of VOTO’s mobile engagement service,” EWB wrote.
 Numida Technologies
 Numida is a fintech working on “growing African small businesses through offering credit. It was founded in 2015 by Mina Shahid, Ben Best, and Catherine Denis.
 The startup currently has operations in Uganda with plans to expand beyond.
 Numida’s mobile app lets small businesses keep track of their financials on a daily basis. This helps them build a financial track record. Which they can leverage to access credit services.
 EWB provided convertible note equity as well as “EWB fellows” who offer talent support. The company also helped them secure grant funding. Thi was used to “execute a pilot with over 1000 entrepreneurs in 2016.”
 Numida has participated in a couple of fellowships. This includes Unreasonable East, Seedstars, Village Capital as well as Blackbox Connect.

"Minister Frank Tumwebaze breaks ground for the construction of government ICT Hub in Nakawa
","Yesterday, Hon. Frank Tumwebaze launched the construction of an ICT Hub at Nakawa. In September this year, Daily Monitor quoted the minister saying that there is a need for a collective center for innovators if the government is to sufficiently support ICT innovations.
 
 “Someone talked of mentorship and subsidized internet but where do I find you to mentor you or to subsidize internet? That means there must be a common center or we should have these public hubs so that we can come in,” Daily Monitor quoted Hon. Tumwebaze.
 
 Two months down the road, it seems the minister is on the right track to deliver on his word.
 During the ceremony, that took place at the Uganda Institute of Information and Communications technology -UICT, several innovations were exhibited. These were by students of UICT. The architectural design was also showcased to the public for the first time.

 — Ministry of ICT&amp;NG (@MoICT_Ug) November 8, 2017
 
 Construction will be done by the UPDF engineering brigade and according to Hon. Tumwebaze, itll deliver the innovation hub in six months time
 Hon. Tumwebaze, in his speech, pointed out that we want to support those ideas that have passed the trial test and have gone to the market. He also added that we must put innovation hubs where ideas are generated in colleges and universities.
 
 
 Government should be willing to buy innovations that are created locally by our innovators, said Hon. Tumwebaze.
 
 
 However, this has not come with no criticism from the public. Some people are wondering why the government is undertaking a project that many in the private and not-for-profit area have already done. Wondering why they are not in a public-private partnership instead.
 TMS Ruge, mid this year, when the idea was first conceived by the government disagreed with it at go. Classifying it as a me too project to portray themselves as doing something.

 While as the government has picked up interest in Innovation recently, one can only hope that this doesnt turn into another ploy for those that are looking for new projects to swindle money.
 The event was also attended by Kirunda Kivejinja, the Second Deputy Prime Minister, Hon. Col. Engola Okello and Dr. Dorothy Okello. Dr. Okello is the chair-governing Council of UICT, chair ICT Innovations Program of the ICT Innovation Hub, and has worked closely with UCCs ACIA.

"Chipper cash wants to do to money what WhatsApp did to texting
","Moving money across Africa is still a challenge that not even mobile money has been able to solve. Where it has attempted to, the costs have been ridiculous. And yet this is what Chipper Cash wants to solve, according to Ham Serunjogi, the co-founder, and CEO.
 Chipper Cash is a platform that allows you to send and receive any amount of money across the East African region (for now) for free.
 We do not charge any fees at all and there is no minimum amount so you can send any amount, says Chipper Cash.
 According to Ham, as a continent, we have come far with financial innovation. Yet, that is not enough. He believes that the finance industry is still lacking and lagging when it comes to innovation.
 If you think of how the pace of progress in the financial industry has been quite slow, it is unacceptable, he told me in an interview.
 Also read: You can now record your phone calls using the Truecaller app
 Currently, the existing options for sending and receiving money across the continent have their own limitations. These range from a small area covered by a service to ridiculous costs involved. Issues that Ham believes Chipper Cash takes into account.
 There is no reason why someone who is on MTN has to go and get cash to send to someone who is on Airtel, Ham wonders. 
 He relates what Chipper is trying to do to what WhatsApp did to texting. Years ago, people were very cautious on how long a text message would be. But today, with Whatsapp, you type as freely as you want, Ham said.
 That is why he maintains that Chipper Cash will be free.
 Chipper is free and it always will be, he pointed out. Though declined to reveal how they will make money saying that their business model takes that into account. 
 
 We are careful about not divulging all the details about it [but] we have built a very sound and sustainable business model around providing a free service.
 
 Launched in July 2018, Chipper Cash is currently live in Uganda and Tanzania.
 So if you happen to have a friend in Tanzania, you can send them money today, right now [from Uganda], Ham told me. Kenya, Rwanda, and Ghana are set to follow in the next few months.
 The way it is, anyone in Uganda can move money around without any charges except MTN Mobile Money and Airtel money charges. This applies to everything including moving money from MTN Mobile Money to Airtel Money wallets. As long as they are doing that using the Chipper Cash wallet.
 When I signed up for the service, I received UGx. 500 on my mobile money and Ham also sent me UGx. 1500 directly to my Mobile Money through the service from San Francisco.
 Ham (standing) and his co-founder Maijid. Photo: Ham Serunjogi
 When asked about the traction they have gained so far, Ham described it as quite positive. Adding that we see the use cases that we had envisioned are exactly what people are using it for. 
 He attributes this to the fact that people get the benefits of the platform right away.
 Ham and his team arent the first people looking to solve the issue of moving money across the African continent.
 Stone Atwine has been flirting with the idea on the internet for the biggest part of 2018 with his startup Eversend. However, they havent gone live yet  despite promising to launch in July 2018 in an interview I had with him.
 He points out that they are aware of the interest coming from different directions.
 We are aware that people have spoken about doing something in this space, he said. Though he added that no one has done it yet. Attributing this to the fact that its a tough challenge.
 
 I think that speaks to the difficulty of the problem. If it is easy to solve, then someone would have already done it. And so the fact that nobody has done it yet shows how difficult it is.
 
 A former Facebook employee, Ham quit the company a few months ago to focus 100% on Chipper Cash as the CEO.
 The team is currently spread across four cities and mainly comprised of Maijid Moujaled, a co-founder and President as well as Patrick Triest, the CTO. This will grow up to at least 40 people by close of the year.
 We have a global team currently spread out across four locations  San Francisco, New York, Nairobi, and Accra. We will have a team of about 40 people across the world by the end of this year.
 So far, Ham says the startup has raised some external funding but that is not yet public information. Though they will share it at the right time, which he says will be in the next few weeks.

 We are excited to announce that SafeBoda and MTN Uganda have partnered to give customers access to the #SafeBoda app at zero MBs.
 
 This move comes at a time when the once only ride-hailing company for boda-bodas has come under fierce competition from Uber and Taxify. The two companies started accepting boda-bodas on their platform earlier this year.
 See also: Ugandas SafeBoda nolonger Safe, Taxify going after it
 On the surface, the partnership is good for SafeBoda as it will allow the startup to tap into users who might not have a data connection at all times.
 For MTN, its a move to sway users from its competitors who are trying to gain an edge over it when it comes to data subscribers. As well as promote their Pulse promotion among young people.
 Under the partnership, SafeBoda will provide free rides worth UGX 5,000 that will be
 given out to MTN Pulsers every month based on MTN Pulse bundles that they activate, part of the press release read.
 It could also mean that MTN is looking to invest in SafeBoda. Perhaps, this is one of the precursors to the next stage of a long-term relationship.
 No matter how good this move by SafeBoda is, it might lead to arm-twisting from MTNs end. Where the company might not be in a position to open itself up to partnerships with other telecoms.
 The way it is with Jumia in Uganda. MTN being an investor in the company, Jumia users can only use MTN to make mobile money payments.

"Norwegian business community lures Ugandan business enterprises
","Oslo  The Norwegian business community would like to increase its partnership with Ugandan business enterprises through the Norwegian-African Business Association (NABA). NABA serves as a platform where business opportunities in Africa are promoted, and as a channel between Norwegian and African business communities. And, it works towards increasing efficient and less risky trade between Norway and Africa.
 NABA currently has 126 member companies doing business in 44 African countries in the sectors of oil and gas, renewable energy, agribusiness, finance, tourism, shipping, fishery and real estate. 16 of these companies operate in Uganda.
 Thecelah Ndagire caught up with the NABA Managing Director, Mr. Eivind Fjeldstad at the just concluded seventh annual Nordic-African Business Summit in Oslo.
 Today, most African countries are beyond aid discussions but interested mutual trade relations. Where does Uganda fit within the NABA partnership?
 In NABA we are very happy to promote win-win solutions and great partnerships between Norwegian and Ugandan business communities. We believe there is a huge untapped potential for more business collaboration. We are doing everything we can to promote the opportunities in Uganda and Norway. We think companies in Uganda will benefit from working with Norwegian companies who are serious partners you can trust.
 Is the partnership with Africa strategic or a legacy for Norway?  
 For a business to succeed, it requires win-win solutions. I dont think there has been a clear business strategy or policy for Africa in Norway. Our organization is advocating for more, better and safer trade and investments between our two countries.
 A big percentage of the African economy relies on Agriculture, how does NABA plan to work with the agricultural sector? 
 Too few Norwegian agribusiness companies are focusing on the global growth markets in Africa. I think this is where we have a huge potential to contribute with inputs to the important value chain. It is madness that a continent with so many agribusiness opportunities needs to import food, but I think many governments are now addressing the issue, and I do hope more Norwegian investors can contribute to Africas green revolution and better value chains. Our best example is Yara International who has been working with fertilizer for African farmers since the 1960s. The Yara CEO &amp; President told the audience in Oslo that he thinks that African markets will be the most important ones for Yara in the future  and we could not agree more.

 Which Ugandan sectors is NABA targeting?
 For now, most Norwegian investors have focused on the energy and technology sectors, but I believe there are also great opportunities within aquaculture and agriculture. Fortunately, we have a good relationship with the Ugandan embassy who can keep us informed on what is required of investments.
 In relation to this year’s Summit theme (“Investing in Africas transition: how, not why?”), how can Uganda tap into the opportunities?
 I think Uganda is well positioned, as our key focus areas this year is energy, technology, and finance  and we have companies in all three sectors working in Uganda today. We are also very happy that the Government sent two Ministers to take part, and share their experiences and insights.
 How can private enterprises in Uganda build synergy with NABA? And, what channels do they have to go through?
 Ugandan companies that are interested in working with Norwegian investors should contact us (NABA). The Norwegian embassy in Kampala is also a great first stop, where I know we have excellent colleagues working with private sector development. And of course, Ugandan companies should become members of our association.

"We raised funding from Greentec &#038; Village Capital, Henri Nyakarundi
","Henri Nyakarundi is the founder of Rwanda-Headquartered ARED Group. ARED stands for African Renewable Energy Distributors. The company describes itself as a HaaS, a “Hard-tech as a Service”. It recently expanded to Uganda making it its second market.
 Born in Kenya, Henri grew up in Burundi before moving to Atlanta, Georgia, in the U.S. in 1996. He graduated in 2007 with a computer science degree. But later moved back to Rwanda in 2013, as he says, “to develop a project that was really dear to me called ARED.”
 ARED, a business in a box solar kiosk, empowers mostly women and people with disabilities using a micro-franchise business model.
 Both Henri and his company have attained many milestones in the recent past. From a CNN feature, winning energy innovation awards to raising funding.
 I had a one-on-one with him and we discussed a couple of things. Ranging from scepticism surrounding grants to challenges facing innovators in Rwanda and Africa.
 Challenges: Rwanda
 There are many challenges affecting entrepreneurs across Africa. Yet, some are unique to a region or country. This is the case with Rwanda. “The problem in Rwanda is that access to funding is harder compared to Uganda &amp; Kenya,” Henri pointed out
 The Rwandan government has been very supportive of entrepreneurship in the recent past. But this hasn’t helped save the situation.
 For example in May 2016, RDB, Rwanda Development Board announced the launch of its flagship project, Kigali Innovation City. It is also one of the key supporters of the country’s first Hub/Incubator, kLab.
 Yet Henri thinks that “because we have a culture that is very government-driven” is the reason Rwanda is still lagging behind.
 Government taking the lead implies the private sector has become “non-existent compared to other countries.”
 The Rwandan government is doing what many across Africa have always wanted theirs to do. Yet, that seems not enough to spark investment and growth the startups.
 When you look at countries like Kenya and Nigeria, it has been the efforts of the private sector. The governments have only played catch up.
 Henri says the way things are doesn’t encourage companies moving on beyond the startup stage. “You find startups staying startups for years and years,” he says. “Because there is no way for them to grow like access to funding. The market is also a small one.”
 Challenges: Africa
 Technology and startups are a new concept in the African sphere. Which means a lot of catch-ups must be done to ensure those looking to reap from the area as their peers in the west did. But, this comes with a lot of challenges.
 According to Henri, “we still have a big problem of valuation of companies.”
 This is on two fronts; The first being automatic under-valuation by investors basing on your location.
 “If you do a fintech in Africa and register in Africa while another person registers in the [United] States [of America], the valuation is different,” he says. “Even though you guys do the same thing.”
 Second, the people starting up technology companies do not understand valuation.
 “Even young companies do not know how to value themselves. So they lower their valuation to nothing because they do not understand how technology companies get valued. Technology companies dont get valued the same as a traditional business. But those things we dont know. More so the young guys,” Henri says.
 Grants: Their role in African entrepreneurship
 East Africa is a hotbed for impact investment capital in Africa, and Nairobi is the capital.
 “In total, 186 impact capital vehicles are active across East Africa, managed by 107 fund managers and 28 other impact asset managers including foundations, family offices, banks, and angel networks,” according to a 2014 report by AVCA. The African Venture Capital and Private Equity Association. “ In addition, 20 DFIs are active in the region.”
 The report also says that “since inception, DFI investors active in the region today have publicly recorded more than USD 7.8 billion across over 410 direct investments, while non-DFI impact investors have disbursed nearly USD 1.4 billion through more than 550 deals.
 This has led “grantpreneurs”; Entrepreneurs who finance their businesses through grants.
 Last year, while speaking at the Accelerating Africa 2.0, EchoVC founder Eghosa Omoigui said that “such founders excel at the art of acquiring grants, but not at necessarily building a business from them.” Henri differs in opinion. Saying that “you cant do research and development without grants.
 “Thats why if you look at China, Asia, Europe and America, they spend billions and billions of dollars on grants. Why? Because they understand that to stay ahead of the game, they need to keep developing new technology.”
 Adding that the value of grants won’t be realized now because “new technology has value in the long term.” Plus, technology financed by grants takes long. This makes it unattractive for other forms of capital financing. Hence the grants. “You can not produce new technology on a loan for example,” Henri says.
 One of the versions of AREDs Solar-Powered Mobile Kiosks
 But even when it comes to grants, the majority  if not all  of the funds have come from the West and Asia. African governments and organizations haven’t participated as much.
 Henri thinks this is “the reason why Africa has very low technology development”. The reasons, he says, is that “we dont fund R&amp;D.”
 “We expect people to get in business and have a product ready. Thats why you see that we import technology. Everything you see in Africa is imported. We dont develop almost anything.”
 Around 8 years ago, there was a scandal in Uganda about the misuse of Global Fund. The funds were meant to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Such occurrences aren’t rare, especially in grant money funded projects.
 Although none is publicly known amongst entrepreneurs, many fear it may be taken as free money. Hence not spark the efforts as one would if they raised it from Angel investors or VCs.
 Henri’s ARED has been a big beneficiary of grant and awards money. As well as social impact investment capital. But he also admits that many that receive such category of money might not use it as effectively as they could otherwise.
 “Of course people view grants as free money,” Henri admits. Though he advises that “if youre smart, you gonna use that money smart[very well].”
 To him, “it is like anything else” and “if you use it dumbly, you not gonna make it too far.” Pointing out that “without grants, I wouldnt be talking to you.”
 “I would say 80% of our technology was developed through grants and competitions. Thats about $1M.”
 Henri has an obsession with grants. To the extent that you may not realize that he has received investment before outside grants.
 But he says it is because he wants to promote African technology. “Thats really my goal,” Henri says.
 
 “Besides having a company, I am trying to push the youths to develop African technology. Because we can not have a sustainable development economically if we do not own our technology. Theres a reason why America and Asia are the top economies. Thats because they export technology.”
 
 In the past decades, China rose to become a manufacturing and technology powerhouse. Overtaking Europe and Japan to now rivalling the United States. But, that came with proactiveness.
 CNN Money wrote: “As China has raced to become a hi-tech manufacturing powerhouse, it stands accused by the U.S. government, industry groups and think tanks of trying to take a shortcut by spying, hacking or forcing companies to hand over their intellectual property.”
 “China understood that quickly,” Henri says. “When it was rising, one of the things they did was so smart. Any company that used to come to them, the number one rule was that if they wanna open shop in China, they had to share the technology with the Chinese. We dont do that [in Africa].”
 Investment
 ARED was founded in 2013. Initially, Henri funded the whole project. He says that he “was able to use the profit[s] I gained from my last business to research and develop the solar kiosk and fund two years of business operations.”
 However, that has since changed. When I asked him about investment, he said they have so far used a mixture of grants and investor capital. “We have investors. We just dont talk about them,” Henri says. Village Capital is one of them. Though their “biggest investor is called GreenTec Capital.”
 ARED was the second company Greentec capital invested in. The investment company has also invested in Uganda’s Wazi Vision giving it up to $800,0000 last October. Greentec and Village Capital invested $250,000 and $50,000 respectively. However, the company is still seeking to raise an additional $1.5 Million.
 Product Development
 “Hardware is hard. Its called hardware for a reason.” said prominent Silicon Valley VC, Marc Andreessen. The statement “hardware is hard” is not just a statement. It is a testament to the number of hardware startups that have faced their deaths in the most recent past.
 However, it seems hardware is even harder for those in Africa. Because, as Henri confirmed, “there are no product development companies in Africa.” Though they tried to make some designs in Rwanda, “it didnt work out too well”.
 Kenya is trying to, according to Henri, “but theyre not there yet.” This implies that one has to look beyond the continent.
 Countries like German, China or the U.S. are usually the first option. “You have to go to Europe or America or China to develop,” Henri says. Though he warns that “China is complex” because “the laws are not as protective as in Europe.”
 Developing a product outside Africa is expensive. The main reason. “Manpower costs 10x more in Europe and the States than it does in Africa,” Henri says.
 But again, in most cases, these grants come from European and American organizations and Foundations. They’d also want to create business for their home companies. “When you get grants from Europe and America, they make sure that you use their companies,” Henri warns.
 Currently, ARED is using a German hardware company called Techsolute. They have been working with them, for now, two and a half years and Henri thinks it is “very good.”
 Expansion
 As mentioned earlier by Henri, one of the biggest challenges a company in Rwanda faces is the small market size.
 Last year, ARED decided to expand to Uganda. Making it their second market. They started the process of registration and hiring from mid-2017 until the end of the year. Though fully started operations in January this year.
 “So we registered our company in May,” Herni says. “Of course, we had to wait for licensing and all. We got the licence in November and brought our first kiosk in January. Now we are piloting. Our expansion is to use what the telecoms have been using for decades. We use an aggregator model. We licence your technology to local partners and share the revenue.”
 The company plans to divide Uganda into five areas. Then after the pilot, they “shall start looking for area developers that will help us develop those areas.” The current estimate is that Uganda will have between 3000 to 5000 solar kiosks at full market potential.

"Musanga, a logistics startup, has secured a partnership with MTN Zambia
","Musanga, a Zambia-based on-demand delivery startup, has secured a partnership with MTN Zambia. Under the terms, Musangas users  including drivers and merchants  will access various financial offerings from MTN.
 According to Njavwa Mutambo, the co-founder and CEO, the startup has shipped over 30,000 packages since March. This was handled by 450+ independent drivers.
 The key incentive for drivers to sign up, according to Njavwa, has been the demand. We have some big accounts such as Pepsi and recently, Dangote, wrote Njavwa in an email.
 Currently, they are looking to increase the number of drivers to 1500 by close of 2018. Musanga is, thus, hoping to use the MTN partnership to lure more drivers to its platform.
 Through MTN our drivers can get loans of up to $400 dollars for things like fuel, wrote Njavwa.
 The partnership will also allow Musanga to avoid the burden of dealing with cash. FMCGs usually pay us with cheques, so nothing cool [for them] here. But the SMEs use cash and thats where the MTN partnership will play a huge role, said Njavwa.
 Also read: Nigerian startups raised at least $117M in the first 3 quarters of 2018
 Founded in 2016 by Njavwa Mutambo and Emmanuel Kwenda, Musanga only launched their platform officially on October 12, 2018. The same day they announced the partnership with MTN Zambia.
 Yet, Njavwa says that since then, they are shipping about 2000 packages daily. He also noted that this number is growing at 4% day on day.
 Musanga primarily works with FMCG brands to help them distribute their products countrywide. These deliveries are done by independent truck drivers, like Uber, but for trucks.
 Early this year, the startup received equity free funding from the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator. They also got funding from a Boston based Ground Squirrel Ventures. Though Njavwa declined to disclose the amount, only pointing out that it was equity funding.
 In total, they have closed at least $250,000 in disclosed funding. Though, they are currently raising a Series A. Musanga is currently raising its $2 million Series A and will expand next year, wrote Njavwa.
 The expansion target is two markets that they are yet to make public.
 Musanga operates a revenue share business model with the drivers. They take about 9-20% of transaction fee, depending on value. These drivers sign up through acquisition agents that Musanga hires across the country. Additionally, others can also use the website to sign up.

"MTN and Orange launch Mowali, a pan-African mobile money interoperability service
","MTN and Orange have launched a pan-African mobile money interoperability service. Called Mowali, the service will enable interoperable payments across the continent.
 Mowali makes it possible to send money between mobile money accounts issued by any mobile money provider, in real time and at low cost, reads part of the press release.
 Mowali will immediately benefit from the reach of MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money. Bringing together over 100 million mobile money accounts and mobile money operations in 22 of sub-Saharan Africa’s 46 markets.
 Interestingly, MTN has also announced that they will be reviving the mobile money service in South Africa. Additionally, they are set to apply for a mobile money licence in Nigeria. This will further grow the reach that the service can tap into.
 The aim of Mowali is to increase the usage of mobile money by consumers and merchants. But, enabling the sending and receiving of money across borders also means solving the remittance problem.
 Africa has the most expensive money remittance corridor in the world. According to Send Money Africa, sending money across Africa is almost twice as it is to send to Africa. Stating that “the top 10 most expensive corridors are intra-African.”
 While as it costs 9.1% to send money to Africa as of 2017 Q3, according to the World Bank, the cost of remitting money between South Africa and Botswana stood at 19.86% in Q4 of 2016 according to Send Money Africa. Making it the most expensive corridor in the world.
 
 It functions as an industry utility, open to any mobile money provider in Africa, including banks, money transfer operators and other financial service providers.
 
 As the epicentre of mobile money growth, there are a plethora of other services operating mobile money services in Africa including Safaricoms M-Pesa, Tigo Cash or Tigo Pesa, Vodafone Cash, and Airtel Money. This, therefore, will be possible because having the two telecoms work together is the beginning.
 Mowali is ready to enable interoperability between digital financial service providers beyond MTN and Orange operations and markets, the two pointed out. Adding that they hope the service to support the existing 338 million mobile money accounts in Africa.
 By bringing other telecoms on board, the service will do to mobile what Mastercard and Visa have done to the banking. Therefore, both MTN and Orange are anticipating that other telecoms will come on board.
 Though, unlike VISA and Mastercard, Mowali will transcend telecoms. The service will also include banks and other financial service providers.
 In Africa, the line between a telecom and a bank is becoming blurred each day. The two industries are working closer than ever before. This is to ensure they can deliver their respective service and products seamlessly.
 For example, this week, Standard Bank launched its mobile communication services using Cell C’s network in South Africa.

 At this very event, some entrepreneurs were allowed to pitch their ideas to the group from the agri-sector, IT-sector, and education sector.
 This seminar was designed to raise collective wisdom about angel investing. Which, as we later learnt, is one of the many activities that AEAngels is doing. (See also: Uganda’s Geoffrey Ssekatawa wins $50,000 for recycling motor oil)
 In a conversation with Sofia Maarouf, who sits on the award team of the African Entrepreneurship Awards, we were able to understand more about AEAngels.
 Find details of our conversation below;
 Startup Digest Africa: What is AE Angels? How does it work? Are you looking at investing in AE Award winners and nominees only?
 Sofia Maarouf: AE Angels was soft-launched 2017 as part of the African Entrepreneurship Award, a BMCE Bank of Africa initiative. AEAngels stands for African Entrepreneurship Angels. The AEAngels network creates opportunities for angel investors to meet their peers, hear qualified entrepreneurs pitch, and provides anonymous access to qualified deal flow from the African Entrepreneurship Award Entrepreneurs pool.
 SDA: How many countries are you covering?
 SM: We provide investment opportunities to all 54 African countries. We are starting by launching local Investment events where Entrepreneurs are invited to pitch to a selected audience of Angel Investors. We had our first event in Kampala, Uganda in November 2017, and the next events are scheduled for the first quarter of 2018 in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Madagascar.
 SDA: Are you looking to work closely with the already existing Angel Networks across the continent and other continents? What will be the nature of the relationship?
 SM: AEAngels is an independent network. However, we welcome all Angel Investors no matter which angel network they are already part of. Our goal is to improve their investing efforts across Africa and close the startup funding gap.
 SDA:  But, the existing Angel Networks are still finding it difficult to stimulate local angel investment across the continent. What are you looking to do different apart from what theyre already doing?
 SM: AEAngels is leveraging the African Entrepreneurship Award network of over 11000 entrepreneurs, as well as a network of over 300 Mentors who can also become Investors.

 SDA: This sounds similar to the previous question, but, what can be done to ensure local Angels are cultivated and also pick interest in local startups?
 SM: Angel investors need to be exposed to more investment opportunities of vetted Entrepreneurs, which is what we plan on doing. This would show them the opportunities that are available.
 SDA: Are there any deals members of AE Angels have made so far? In case yes, what are the most outstanding so far?
 SM: No, not yet as we are still in Pilot Phase.
 SDA: What is an ideal business that AEAngels will be focusing on and encourage its members to invest in?
 SM: There is no ideal business as each Angel Investor looks for something different when they want to invest.
 SDA: What criteria are you using to admit one to AEAngels? Is it an invite only? Again, if yes, who qualifies?
 AEAngels is open to all Angel Investors interested in investing in African Businesses.
 SDA: Any details you think people should know about AE Angels?
 AEAngels is part of a larger initiative which is the African Entrepreneurship Award, a yearly$1 million award for African Entrepreneurs, powered by BMCE Bank of Africa.

"Nigeria&#8217;s Paga hires software engineers based in Nigeria for the first time
","For close to a decade, Paga had its software developed and maintained in Ethiopia. This came as a result of an arrangement the company reached with Apposit, close to 10 years ago.
 While starting out, Paga considered outsourcing the software development to India. Until they met up with the team from Apposit  a software development firm based in Ethiopia.
 The firm not only ended up developing and maintaining the software, but they also became investors in Paga.
 Yet, as Paga grows, there seems to be an increasing demand that they also have another team set up in Nigeria. Tayo thinks one of the reasons is the advantage of understanding the problem they are solving firsthand.
 By having the engineering team based in a market where we do not yet operate, we lose some level of empathy that is born of interacting with the product and users, he wrote.
 They have thus decided to hire the co-founders of a startup that Tayo before invested in.
 I am excited to announce that Bayo Puddicombe and Zubair Abubakar, co-founders of ChopUp  along with Daniel Micah  have joined Paga’s Product Development team as our first Nigerian based engineers.
 Bayo joined Paga as a Senior Software Engineer. He will lead the companys Digital Financial Services team. While Zubair joined as a Senior Software Engineer. He will lead the Developer API and Developer Community team.

"OCA is introducing VentureBuilder to scale Off-Grid Access in Africa
","Open Capital Advisors (OCA), a management consulting and financial advisory firm based in Nairobi, is introducing VentureBuilder, a new program aimed at accelerating the growth and adoption of off-grid access across the continent.
 Dubbed VentureBuilder, the venture is looking at combination of deep PAYG expertise and systems development coupled with early-stage investment to African-owned and locally-managed distributors.
 VentureBuilder offers these distributors both capital and bespoke enterprise development advisory services to help them harness their local market knowledge and rapidly scale a PAYG off-grid solar business model.
 According to OCA, Over 120 million households in Africa lack access to adequate electricity. Although theres been a growth in interventions over the past decade, the firm believes that the surface of the problem is yet to be scratched.
 Even though the off-grid solar industry is flourishing, it currently serves less than two percent of the total addressable market, with only a small number of companies operating at scale, wrote OCA.
 Sponsored: Find out how Unreasonable East Africa can support your business
 With VentureBuilder, they hope to close this gap. We believe this approach will build a new generation of local solar companies that are rooted in their communities and are capable of reaching populations that cannot be sustainably accessed by the current model of large, vertically-integrated businesses.
 In a whitepaper giving a detailed overview of VentureBuilder, OCA points out that Despite over US$500M in global investment in off-grid solar in 2016–17 alone, there is a striking lack of greenfield activity across much of the rest of Africa, where most markets are virtually untouched by scalable ventures.
 VentureBuilder will, therefore, provide enterprise development services (EDS) and
 early-stage investment to locally-owned and managed distributors, or operating companies (OpCos), targeting the distribution challenge, resulting primarily from the gap in human capital and systems to work at the local level.
 By 2022, the target is to build a portfolio of operating companies that Operate at scale in ten countries across Sub-Saharan Africa, deliver to at least 1 million connections, and directly impact the lives of more than 5 million Africans.

"Uganda&#8217;s SafeBoda is rumored to have raised $1.1 Million this year
","Over the past 8 months, SafeBoda has undergone a serious facelift. But, if you follow startups, no one undergoes such changes without having a comfortable buffer of cash to burn.
 That is why that made me curious and decided to find out if the boda-hailing company had raised some external funding that it never made public. It turned out that company had raised $1.1 Million in January 2018.
 This is according to two people who said were familiar with the investment details. Though they declined to reveal the details of who invested considering they only spoke to me on conditions of anonymity.
 Last week, I paid a visit to SafeBoda’s offices on Bukoto Street and met Maxime Dieudonné  a co-founder and co-CEO. I let him know that I was writing an article about their round of funding, he didn’t seem surprised.
 We talked briefly and he told me that they’ve been able to attract some “world class” investors to Uganda.
 But, he didn’t want our conversation recorded and preferred that I send him questions for an email interview in order for him to clarify the issue. Though, this week, he told me that he wouldnt comment on the issue any further.
 “Hi Peter, sorry for slow reply  the thing is that I will need to respond most of your questions by no comments,” Maxime wrote to me. Adding that we are a private company and do not disclose most [of] the information you are asking.”
 Perhaps they discussed it internally and decided not to go public with the information or keep everyone continuing to guess.
 He also added that the $1.1 Million figure is wrong, but declined to reveal what the actual amount is. The financial information you are disclosing in the article is incorrect  but as I said I wont further comment, Maxime wrote.
 There’s no doubt SafeBoda raised funding as I trust the people I spoke to. Plus, Maxime promised to “write a few lines about the fundraising journey” and how they managed to “bring world-class investors to Uganda.”
 More activities that support the assertion is the trend SafeBoda has been on lately. Here is how 2018 has been for the boda-hailing company so far;
 SafeBoda announced its plans to expand to Kenya early in this year and started setting up the office. The expansion was finalized a few weeks ago when the boda-hailing company’s other co-CEO, Alastair Sussock, announced that they were live in Nairobi.
 According to Sautitech, the company is also pondering expanding to Nigeria.
 Beyond the expansion, the company also added another office in March this year. Before, the company was based in Kyebando, a more out of the CBD suburb of Kampala.
 Yet, the newly added office is in Kisementi  a more prime location of Kampala. Just a few metres away from Andela’s office. The office could be costing the company at least $5,000 per month.
 Also read: Another boda-hailing company, Dial Jack, launches in Uganda
 Currently, SafeBoda is discounting all rides taken at 50% for cash payments and 70% for credit. This implies that if you take a ride worth UGX 10,000, you pay UGx. 5,000 with cash and UGx. 3,000 with credit. SafeBoda pays the rest for you and the offer has been running for now over 3 months.
 This makes it as affordable as Taxify and almost matches the cost of taking the regular taxis (Matatus). But, it is a heavy Cost of Acquisition of Customers that one ought to have raised a significant amount of funding to even consider undertaking.
 Additionally, the company has rapidly scaled its number of riders. Although SafeBoda is not open about the correct number of riders, my estimate is that they entered 2018 with between 1000 to 1500 riders. Yet, last night, I took a SafeBoda numbered 5068. This implies the company has scaled this number at least 2.5x.
 Though this scaling hasn’t come without backlash from their customers as most are now half-baked. The company was faced with public outlash the past few weeks that they were compelled to issue an apology.
 
 We apologise for the recent inconsistent customer experience. Our growing quality team is working tirelessly to test and retrain SafeBodas in customer care and app use to ensure a good quality service, every time. pic.twitter.com/jTmb2bNXUL
 — SafeBoda (@SafeBoda) August 1, 2018
 When you put all the above into perspective plus the reputation of the people I spoke to, I was compelled to make the conclusion. Even though Maxime later insisted that the figure is incorrect.

"5 Entrepreneurial Skills I Have Learnt as an Anzisha Fellow
","1. Focus
 There is nothing more important for any entrepreneur than focus. How far you will go in terms of achieving your goals and your vision as an entrepreneur is determined by how focused you are.
 Imagine taking a journey to which you have no end destination in mind; you find yourself just walking aimlessly as you go through a series of ups and downs. Focus is a key success trait, because it allows you to be able to do the right thing at the right time, make the right decisions and get access to the right resources which will make achieving the end goal easier for you. As Anzisha Fellows, one of the lessons we are taught is around focus.
 To gain focus, you have to ask yourself which business are you in? Why are you in that business and what do you want to be the outcome? If you are going to achieve big then you also have to be big on focus. You can’t afford to be swayed away from your end goals.
 2. Continuous learning
 Whether we like it or not, even if we are the founders of the best ideas, we still have to learn and continuously enhance and develop our skills. The person that you embodied a year ago has to be different to the person that you embody now.
 This does not only keep you up to date and enlightened, but it keeps you and your ideas competitive in a dynamic world. You should articulate to every life challenge with an open mind and be ready to learn from every experience.
 During my experience as an entrepreneur, I have realized that the more I expose myself to experts and professionals, the more my ideas get challenged and the more I learn.
 3. Communication
 Human beings are social beings. As an entrepreneur, you are obliged to be a serial communicator. Whether or not your team will meet goals and perform up to your expectation will be determined by how well you communicate.
 Investment and donations will only come if you are able to communicate your plans and your vision. Keep your stakeholders engaged by investing your time in communication. This may not be an easy fit but it is definitely worth it. I always view every new relationship or contact as a newly cultivated field.
 If you ignore that field over a period of time, when you come back weeds would have taken over. Just like networks, keep cultivating on them through communication. It is always good to over-communicate than to under communicate. Never assume your audience know what you are talking about so make sure you master the art of communication.
 4. Execution
 You can never be successful by not acting. Those who we know to be successful today are executors, meaning they get things done. Very often people find themselves coming up with amazing ideas and strategies which at the end of the day never see the light of day.
 Human beings are prey to procrastination hence we are always vulnerable. Procrastination is also a result of being too comfortable. Always ask yourself how much you want something and if you want it so much, then you need to work on it no later than now.
 Sometimes the only way to start is to focus on the, “what if this actually goes well,” phrase. Most people end up not executing because of the fear of the unknown, but this is what only makes you an entrepreneur, taking risks.
 If you can’t take risks the entrepreneurial way of life is not yours. Trust me, the best satisfaction on your journey as an entrepreneur is when you actually get things done. So do not wait, close the deals now.
 5. Remain human
 No matter what level of achievement you attain, always remember that it is a team effort. Many entrepreneurs get carried away by short-lived events and forget that all their future business success is going to be on the basis of real and strong relations with people in their businesses.
 Remaining humble and human in your interactions will earn you respect that you can never buy with any amount of money. No matter what business you may be in; education, technology, food, agriculture or fashion, at the end of the day, you are in the business of people.

"New survey indicates sharp drop in Social Media and Mobile Money usage in Uganda
","Yesterday, results of a survey that was carried out to evaluate the impact of the recent taxes on OTTs (social media) and mobile money were released. However, they indicate a sharp drop in the number of users  as well as the frequency of usage  for both services.
 According to the findings [PDF] of the survey which took place between July 13th and 16th, at least 85% of the respondents hadnt used social media since the tax came into effect.
 96% of respondents had used social media in the past 6 months, the report pointed out. However, noting that this number [had] dropped to 85% when asked if they had accessed social media since July 1st [when the taxes were put into effect].
 Similarly, Mobile Money usage suffered a decline according to the survey. 93% of
 respondents reported that they had used Mobile Money in the last 6 months, it said. But 44% were transacting less money in July and 47% reported that they had completely stopped transacting Mobile Money after the implementation of the new tax
 The survey was carried out by PR Company, Whitehead Communications, and collected information from 3015 respondents. Results were collected both online and through face-to-face interviews across the country, gathering 3,015 responses, said the report.
 Most of the participants in the survey were located in the central region. 72% were resided in Central Uganda, 15% in Western Uganda, 8% in Northern Uganda and 5% in Eastern Uganda, with 93 districts represented overall, the report noted.
 Additionally, the majority were youths between 18 to 35 years of age and at least at a bachelors degree level of education.
 Related: Here’s what ICTAU and PSFU proposed to parliament before OTT  tax came into effect
 Most surveyed respondents were between the ages of 18 and 35 (29% 18 – 24, 41% 25 – 30,15% 31 – 35). 74% of respondents were male and 26% were female. Most respondents were highly educated: 56% had obtained a Bachelor’s Degree, 14% a Master’s or Ph.D, 9% had Vocational Certificate, 15% completed Secondary School, 3% other, 2% had no education and 1% completed only Primary School.
 According to the findings, a sizeable number is accessing social media using VPN application. While an equally impressive number is paying the tax to access the same services.
 Of those who reported as using social media since the new tax was introduced: 40% said they paid the OTT tax; 57% were using VPN; 38% were using WiFi/Hotspot(s) and 3% selected “other”; many used multiple methods.
 Other noteworthy findings of the survey are the impact the taxes have so far had on the businesses and lives of the respondents.
 For example, the mobile money tax has led to delayed payments, general inconvenience, increased cost of doing business, increased risk, loss of income, reverting to banking and cash payments as some noted in their responses.
 While those using social media for business or as individuals pointed out that it had led to delays in conducting business, disrupted payments, general inconvenience, increase in the cost of doing business, loss of income, reduced access and a smaller online audience.
 The essence of the survey, according to Whitehead Communications, was to serve as a resource in a consultative and evidence-based review of social media and mobile money taxes.
 Therefore, the recommendation was that the relevant decision-makers review the detailed results of this survey in full, particularly respondents’ written replies to the questions.
 Additionally, they also recommended that a thorough consultation among all parties going forward to ensure an informed and equitable solution. This is because no respondent was in support of the mobile money tax. While only 1% supported the social media tax strongly.

"Optimism about African Startup landscape and Why I stopped reading Techcruch
","It’s now about three years since I wrote an article about “why I stopped reading Techcrunch” (See copy at bottom) as a guest blog on now defunct Tech Africa blog. At that time I was all-engines fired into the Startup world, very passionate and enthusiastic about building the future unlike today.
 I used the Techcrunch figuratively to highlight a glaring disconnect in models used to build Start-ups on the African continent and in Silicon Valley. My analysis drawn from personal experience exposes the cultural differences and mindsets towards entrepreneurship between the Valley and Africa and how that affect how and who builds Startups on the continent.
 I guess i was doing some soul-searching and deep introspection of the journey I had set for myself. But now things have changed. Oh yeah, even his Zuckerness visited Nigeria and Kenya last year!
 Optimism in Startups
 Three years later, there are more startups across the African continent. Disrupt-Africa reports that African tech startups raised funding in excess of US$129 million in 2016 alone which is 16.8 per cent more compared to the previous year. Theres more optimism among young Africans about the future of the continent as Quartz Africa writes.
 New exciting industries along with high-growth startups are emerging particularly FintTech, e-Commerce and off-grid energy. This is great because the end game of all these industries is a new interconnected continent where more people can come online and consequentially friction-less movement of money and trade.
 Today am still very passionate about Startups for several reasons; there’s vast untapped opportunities on the continent which makes it fertile ground for building interesting things. A growing middle class. Most parts of the continent are still offline.
 Many still don’t have access to clean energy or even running water. In Uganda, only about 20% of the country is wired to the national grid. And yet with an ever-growing population, reliance on energy is inevitable.
 Investing in Infrastructure and Energy
 Japan has pledged $30 billion to fund African infrastructure projects over the next three years according to fortune. East Africa Railway is expected to cost $13 billion and the overall value of East African transportation infrastructure project as of 2015 was valued at $29.4 billion according to Asoko Insights. This is good news because movement of goods and people easily across the continent will have great economic boasts.
 Governments are beginning to invest heavily on power projects to connect more people to the grid. There’s talk about creating an East Africa power pool. This pool will allow member countries to sell off excess capacity to those that need more power. Currently Kenya has installed capacity of 1,600 MW majorly from Geo Thermo well as Uganda has roughly 862MW mainly from Hydro.
 In Uganda, two new hydro power plants — Karuma and Insimba — are expected to come online in less than 12 month. But even with these expectactions, it’ll take years before every single village is wired to the grid. Which makes off-grid energy ever more interesting.
 Off-grid energy and Financial inclusion
 Fenix International, along with M-Kopa with their innovative prepaid solar energy solutions are also connecting more people to clean energy. Fenix now has at least 100,000 customer base in Uganda alone which is great.
 The company also hopes to bundle interesting financial solutions along with its energy products for rural dwellers — micro loans, insurance and saving schemes might be some of the off-short products coming.
 When more people can charge their phones with off-grid energy, it means they can use tones of services that are accessible through their mobile devices. It means a trader in Kampala city can easily communicate and pay their supplier hundreds of miles away in Kumi-Ongino digitally circumventing the challenges of liquid cash.
 A number of people now communicate and make transactions through messaging Apps like WhatsApp. It also means more people might be able to afford micro loans as low as Ugx 20,000 (~$5) via initiatives like MTN Mokash to buy farm supplies or school fees for their kids.
 Car Assembly and manufacturing on the horizon
 Kenya is already in full gear to start car assembly as of last year. Car manufacturer Volkswagen started a plant in Thika which will build the Polo Vivo, the first passenger car built in the country. The plant expects to churn out at least 1000 vehicles per year. French car maker Peugeot too according to Business Daily Africa is set to start an assembly plant in the country this year.
 In Rwanda, Volkswagen signed an agreement with the Government of Rwanda to explore the possibility of setting up a local assembly plant in Rwanda according to the Newtimes Rwanda.
 Uganda meanwhile with its iconic Kiira EV is set to start manufacturing in 2018. Kiira Motors Cooperation, the partly-government owned automobile company last year launched a prototype solar-powered passenger bus.
 Now every middle class family in Africa at least either already owns a Japaneses car or at least aspires to buy one. In Uganda, we even had a hit single urging people not to die without buying a car. So there’s a huge demand for cars this side of the globe despite poor road networks.
 Internet balloons, Fibre and drones
 This is probably my most disappointing piece of the puzzle about the new digital Africa. Despite how critical it is, there’s only been hype and buzz around bridging the digital divide through affordable access to internet. And maybe that’s because we have put our hopes on Silicon Valley big shots to make it happen.
 Facebook and Google have all simply raised dust without anything substantial on the ground. Facebook’s “internet.org” project renamed “internet basics” came under heavy criticism by Net neutrality advocates. The rationale was simple; Facebook had ulterior motives that would make it the sole gatekeeper or chief custodians of the digital experience of most users in Africa.
 Google on the other hand has equally made noise without results. Google’s project link launched in Uganda and Ghana — a novel idea which advocates for sharing of back-haul internet infrastructure which would be leased to Internet Service Providers at a less fee than if they built it themselves.
 There was a lot of excitement in Kampala for instance and we thought Roketelecom’s metropolitan Google-Fibre backed City Wi-Fi network was going to be a game changer.
 But no.
 Three years down the road, neither Facebook’s much hyped internet drones nor Google’s Fibre network has had an effect on internet costs in Uganda. There’s even talk of Elon Musk’s Space X-backed internet satellites, but I have no reason whatsoever to be particularly enthusiastic about them.
 Regional mobile telecoms such as MTN group, Etisalat, Safaricom still reign as kings of mobile internet. Quite frankly, am content with their efforts in bringing more people online. At least there’s 80% 2G/EDGE penetration in most countries in continent, which even though it means slow internet, we can at least be sure there’s some form of connectivity.
 e-Commerce and FinTech
 Internet growth across the continent is making e-Commerce and Fintech more than a reality. Big bulls in the Kraal; Konga, Jumia under Jumia Group (former Africa Internet Group) and Kilimall are investing heavily to increase their share of the e-commerce pie on the continent.
 According to Asoko Insights, Konga, Nigeria’s biggest online retail mall has an estimated revenue of about $164 million while its competitor Jumia Group has $140 million.
 Konga Online Shopping Limited: $164 million
 Jumia Group Limited: $140 million
 Kilimall International Limited: $5 million
 Yudala Limited: $2 million
 Rupu Kenya: $1 million
 ~ Source: Asoko Insights
 What’s not included in these stats are several small e-commerce transactions happening on Social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. There are even e-commerce chatbots now where you can order goods and and services without having to install extra apps.
 Meanwhile, Fintech is the darling of VCs in Africa. There are tens if not hundreds of Fintech startups across the continent. We even have a conference and even an accelerator program based in South Africa specifically for Fintech startups and it’s easy to see why; Africa is leading the world in mobile financial transactions. Banks are super slow and can’t scale. And there’s a huge amount of people that are beginning to use financial and payment services for the very first time.
 The Info-graphic below by Irrational Innovations says it all about the Fintech landscape in Nigeria although some of the players are also operational in other major markets across the continent.
 
 And this is the Fintech landscape in Kenya as adopted from Irishtechnews
 
 
 
 
 Hubs and VCs
 From Lagos Nigeria, to Nairobi Kenya to Cape Town South Africa or Kampala Uganda, Startups are emerging to take on new opportunities. There are currently more than 100 Innovation or Incubation hubs across the continent. These are spaces to build synergies among startups, create networks and leverage on shared infrastructure like broadband internet and co-working space.
 Meanwhile funding has been long taunted as one of the limitations of building startups in the continent. However, a few VC firms are emerging despite being very scanty. In Nigeria for instance, there could be about 12 VC including Lagos Angel Network, Spark, Kernel Fund, Venture Kinetics.
 In Uganda, I know of none. So that’s still a challenge. You can read more about the growing interest of VCs in Africa on this Venturebeat article.
 Scaling across Africa
 Building a startup that scales across the continent is still a big challenge. As they say “Africa isn’t a country”. In most cases Startups that make it usually do so in their home countries. Those that do outside have very deep pockets such as the likes of Jumia Group (former Africa Internet Holdings  AIG) or Uber or M-Kopa.
 Those startups that don’t require too much offline transactions or physical assets on the ground have it slightly easier when scaling.
 The fact is Africa is unique — very unique. Each market is unique to its own geography. Some markets are fast, some are slow. Some are heavily regulated others are not. Some there’s conflict and in others there’s peace. There are more than 2,000 languages on the continent. It’s huge, it’s different it’s awesome.
 Below is a post I wrote in 2014 that I still find relevant today.

 Why I stopped reading Techcruch
 TechCrunch founded by Michael Arrington in 2005 has gone on to provide us with updated news mostly about web 2.0 companies, ranging in size from startups to established NASDAQ-100 firms.
 Up until recently, I’ve been reading TechCrunch. It was one of the first things I visited when I got a chance to access internet on a campus computer lab computer 8–10 years ago as an undergraduate Engineering student.
 I was excited about the web and how small companies were making big leaps in the Tech industry. From the early days of Facebook to when nobody understood what Twitter was all about. TechCrunch was there writing about these cool startups in Silicon valley and it was a source of inspiration to me to the extent that I also starting blogging about Tech in Uganda back in 2010. My single author blog has grown to be a multi-author Tech blogcovering not just Uganda, but the entire African Tech space.
 However, my inspiration from TechCrunch has since faded. Not because it doesn’t cover the African Tech space or because now I have a blog where am the Editor-in-Chief. No. It’s primarily because of the content that TechCrunch is publishing these days and how African Tech ecosystem is deceptively following suite.
 Before writing this post, I visited the site thinking that perhaps the content therein can change my view. Well, it didn’t.
 Misguiding dose of content for entrepreneurs in Africa.
 The blog which I’ve already credited for creating buzz around the dot com bubble concentrates on alleviating closing funding from Venture Capitalists as a means to success. This sends a misguided signal to an upcoming entrepreneur who will think that one must raise several thousand dollars to create a successful venture. The perception that’s formed from this kind of reporting blurs the other aspects of entrepreneurship such as having a solution to a real need, persistence, vision, teamwork, passion among other things.
 There’s also a disconnect between venture capital and startups in Africa. In fact, there’s almost no VC funding for startups in Africa which makes it incredibly hard and nearly suicidal to follow Silicon valley model of building startups in Africa.
 As an internet entrepreneur, I know first hand what it means to raise funds in Africa. It’s probably more daunting than making your startup work.
 In fact before we even get to the whole raising funds thing, lets start with entrepreneurship itself. How supportive is the African environment to business and entrepreneurship? Well, not so supportive. In most societies in Africa, the formulae to success is quite simple. Education. The idea is that one should go to school, graduate with good grades and then get a good job in one of big companies around. As Daniel Mwesigwa puts it, in explaining why you should not drop out university “In Africa, Uganda in particular, education is revered with so much ferocity.”
 The African parent struggles to raise funds to educate their kids up to university after which their Return On Investment must be immediately visible. They aren’t looking at pouring more money into your newly found venture, but rather for you to get out their home and start your own life. Sometimes you are required to start finance the education of your younger siblings now that you have “made it”.
 The stories of self-made college-dropout billionaires such as Bill gates, Zuck, Dell, Jobs are unheard of in Africa. Not only won’t you get financial support, perhaps you won’t even get social support. So if your parents aren’t ready to invest into your startup, who will?
 So when I read screaming headline on TechCrunch that such and such startup has raised several million dollars in series A funding, I take a moment in retrospect to reflect how remote and how hard the odds are that such a thing will happen here at home.
 Upcoming entrepreneurs must come to terms with the harsh realities that are unique to the African environment — and that could actually be a blessing in disguise!
 African entrepreneurs could quite easily escape the ensnare that most innovators fall for — the thinking that you need huge amounts capital to build a successful business. What TechCrunch doesn’t publish is a long tail of startups that despite having raised huge amounts of funding miserably failed.
 Now, I must make it very clear that yes, funding is fundamental in building successful businesses. It should be treated squarely as a means, rather than an end in itself. Once an entrepreneur has proven their business model and there’s a prospective market for the product, they obviously need the funding to scale their business. At this stage one could approach a local bank (although it freaks me out to say this), a VC, or maybe their network of family and friends to take their venture to the next level.
 Entrepreneurs out there must create their own narratives and share them with others so that they can relate and wisely apply them in their own ventures.

"We&#8217;re Grooming Software Developers for Ugandan Startups to Employ &#8211; Lucy, MD Laboremus Uganda
","Over the weekend, i2i facility in partnership with Laboremus Uganda, FSD Uganda, UNCDF MM4P, L-IFT, GladFarm Uganda and innovation Village held the #DataHack4FI at the Innovation Village.
 Over 60 teams signed up for the hackathon, which had no selection criteria by the way. Hilarious, isnt it? Some opted not show up and of those that showed up, others dropped off along the way as the hackathon progressed. After 3 days and 2 nights of no sleep  the winners were announced on Sunday. These were; Killer Analytics, Farm Talk and Insure Me.
 We went ahead and caught up with Lucrezia Biteete, the Managing Director of Laboremus Uganda. She had so much to share and we captured some of it.
 Q: Tell us about Laboremuss role in the #DataHackathon4FI?
 We were contracted as a local organizer for the event in Uganda because i2i doesnt have a local office in Uganda. We also brought on board other sponsors such as Innovation Village, GladFarm to help us in the smooth running of the event.
 Q: What is in it for Laboremus?
 Of course we are very active in the financial inclusion space. We are also looking at the networking aspect and the visibility especially for Laboremus. We are also always looking for young talent. Therefore this was an opportunity for us to showcase Laboremus to these young and brilliant people with ideas so that next we are recruiting they have an idea about Laboremus.
 Q:  What criteria were you using for accepting teams?
 Actually, over 60 teams expressed interest but other dropped out when we started calling back. Basically everyone who wanted to participate is here. We did not eliminate anyone.
 Q: So, how many teams do you have here now?
 In total we have 17 for the first presentation as some have dropped out. A lot of people had done double registration and others had their developers out of the country or some had to come from out of town and were not able to make it in time.
 Q: Are we seeing this event happen again?
 Yes, definitely. i2i has hinted on the fact that theyd like it to be a yearly event but they havent yet confirmed. But this event will continue for one more month through the accelerator program.
 Q: A quick interaction with the team members, at least one of the team members has been at a hackathon before. It looks like they just want to win and not nurture an idea. What is your take?
 If you have a great idea, it is only by getting feedback that you grow. We understand that could be one of the mentalities but our hope is that by interacting with our staff, they are challenged and refine their ideas.
 We hope that after the weekend, the questions they will get from the judges and other people around will challenge them to refine their ideas. If you have a good idea and work on it, you actually dont need to look for funding  itll look for you.
 Q: What is your comment about the Ugandan tech talent?
 Uganda has very talented people and thats why we decided to open here. But they need guidance. They dont know which areas to focus on in order to be employable. For example everyone wants to be a back-end developer yet theres also a demand for front end developers.
 
 We caught up with Lucy, the MD of Laboremus Uganda. Details of the conversation will be out soon! #DataHack4FI #StartupDigestAfrica pic.twitter.com/uCr0GgZRVX

 Secondly, about the innovation and startups, people are in very much need of business advise like being structured and organized. A lot of people have great ideas but where they fail is execution. They also need to learn. There should be a culture of curiosity.
 They need to make use of the internet to avoid duplication. Most people will end up doing something without having an idea of who their competitor is.
 Q: Youre in the same space with Andela and Tunga. Why should developers come to you?
 Andela is mainly a learning program. If you want to join Andela, youre going to learn but if youre to join Laboremus, youre going to learn and do projects which is attractive.
 Secondly, Andela is working for the external markets. Not saying that we dont have an external market, we do but we encourage our developers to work on local projects to interest them in making a local impact.
 Q: To wind up, are you grooming entrepreneurs or employees?
 For our own staff, we are grooming them to work for the startups. All the entrepreneurs and startups will reach a point when their one or two in-house developers are no longer enough and need help. Thats when Laboremus will step in.
 Secondly, we are developing Laboremus Academy to train our staff and outsiders to build the tech landscape especially people leaving the University. There will also be a huge emphasis on Business training. We have already applied for funding.

"Who&#8217;ll eventually win Uganda&#8217;s ridesharing market?
","
 On February 9, ridesharing company Taxify started allowing riders in Kampala book boda-bodas. This placed it in direct competition with SafeBoda. Ugandas pioneer boda-boda ridesharing company. It is also rumoured that Uber will launch UberBoda. Though, Taxify became the first car-ridesharing company in Uganda to allow booking Boda-bodas.
 
 
  
 
 
 But, the question is, wholl come out on top? To arrive at a concrete answer, I will have to take you through assumptions. Otherwise, things in the ride-hailing market change very fast.
 
 
  
 
 
 For your understanding, I will approach this from bottom-down. Statista, an online statistics portal, estimates that by 2020, global revenue of the ridesharing industry will be approximately USD 61.4 billion. They also add that therell be a jump in riders from 338 Million in 2018 to 500 Million in 2020. Thats how big the market is.
 
 
  
 
 
 According to CrunchBase, companies in the ridesharing space took more than 10 percent of all unicorn investments last year. An amount in Billions of dollars. This signifies the importance of ridesharing to our future.
 
 
  
 
 
 Since last year, all the big players in the space  Lyft, Grab, Ola, Didi Chuxing and Uber  have raised funding. Masayoshi Sons SoftBank participated in all, except the U.S focused Lyft. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Currently, Uber and Taxify are leading the ridesharing market on the African continent. With Uber having a presence in 16 African cities and 8 countries. While Taxify having a presence in 8 African cities and 5 countries. Yet SoftBank has a hand in both Uber and Taxify.
 
 
  
 
 
 For Uber, SoftBank is currently the majority shareholder at 15%. After its more than USD 7 Billion investment late last year. For Taxify, Didi Chuxing owns a stake after an undisclosed investment last year. Didi also made a USD 1 Billion investment in Uber as part of the deal for Uber to exit the Chinese market. To wrap up the web of entanglement, Softbank made an investment of over USD 5 Billion in Didi last year.
 
 
  
 
 
 From the above, it is safe to conclude that SoftBank controls the ridesharing market. Through Uber and Didi. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The developing markets werent as lucrative for the leaders Uber and Didi. Thats why they hadnt developed solutions to suit such markets. This gave rise to players like SafeBoda in Uganda, SafeMotos in Rwanda and Go-Jek in Indonesia.
 
 
  
 
 
 But, starting with Uber, the bigger players realized that some solutions that have scaled in the more organized and less trafficked cities may not work. Thats what drove Uber to launch UberMotors in Indonesia, Didi to go on an acquisition and investment spree, and Taxify to diverse and include Boda-bodas (Motorcycles) in Uganda on its platform.
 
 
  
 
 
 This diversification tells the need for these companies to offer an end-to-end service. Uber or any other player in the market wants to be your logistics, riding, banking, payments and everything partner. Achieving this takes huge sums of money. Hence the crazy rounds.
 
 
  
 
 
 No doubt SoftBank won the worlds ridesharing market. But, which brand under their control will thrive? 
 
 
  
 
 
 It is likely to be the one that will adapt to a given market. So, it shouldnt surprise you to see SoftBank killing some brands. Especially in markets where they are number two or not scaling as fast as expected. An example is a hint on the company to pull out of Africa.
 
 
  
 
 
 Taxify has also branded itself as the king of the emerging markets. And, should Uber pull out, I put my two cents on Taxify to take over the ridesharing market on the continent. Boda-bodas included. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Though not known for lavish spending, I doubt SafeBoda or SafeMotos can match them. None of the two has the financial muscle to offer an end-to-end service as compared to Taxify, at least.

"Will WhatsApp Pay affect Mobile Money?
","WhatsApp the global messaging app owned by Facebook recently launched WhatsApp for Business in a few selected countries like India, Brazil, USA, and France. WhatsApp reportedly has started testing out its Unified Payment Interface based payments feature in India.
 The new feature, available for select WhatsApp for Business Beta users on iOS and Android, enables users and Small Businesses to send and receive money using Unified Payments Interface (UPI) standard. Considering that WhatsApp for Business App is focusing on SMEs, the payments platforms integration may give another boost to digital payments around the world but in Africa or to move closer to home in Uganda, this might spell doom and gloom for mobile money payment platforms and Fintech Start-ups in Uganda and Africa as a whole.
 Mobile money, which happens to be an East African invention that has gone on to revolutionize the way people in Africa do business and trade. It has a caused unimaginable disruption to the traditional banking systems in Africa. Financial institutions have realized that the only way they can survive, is to evolve or work together with Telecoms thus the introduction of Agency Banking. Mobile money has now become a force to reckon with. All one has to do is buy a SIM card from a vendor of their preference and register for mobile money services. It is totally a different proposition when opening up a Bank account.
 Standard Chartered Bank has started closing some of its upcountry Branches like in Gulu and Mbarara in Favour of Agency Banking. Stanbic Bank introduced Flexi-Pay, Centenary Bank has Sente Mobile just to name a few. Mobile Money has brought banking services closer to the low-income earners and the rural area masses. It has greatly boosted trade and the way we do business in ways we cannot imagine. Fintechs all across Africa quickly realized the economic and disruptive importance of Mobile money.
 Closer to home, Fintechs like M-cash, Peebu, PayWay, EzeeMoney, Mambo Pay, AkelloMoney, Pegasus Technologies and much more have introduced new ways of paying bills and services through mobile money something that was dominated by financial Institutions back then. One no longer has to go to the bank to pay their electricity bill, water bill or TV bills.
 Payments made on the mobile platform are instant and efficient. When there is instant need buy Yaka Tokens or Pay for Cable TV, all one does is go to the mobile payment Menu and select what they want to pay for. Better yet, some educational institutions now accept mobile money payments when one is clearing school dues.
 With WhatsApp pay currently being Beta tested, it is now a simple matter of when and not if. Very soon, WhatsApp pay will be in Africa. Uganda has close to 24 million mobile phone users and a sizeable number of these own smartphones and uses WhatsApp for both formal and informal communication and with the Launch of WhatsApp pay, there will be serious competition for Mobile money platforms.
 The Unified Payment Interface acts as a payment link between the clients and the businesss respective bank Account. WhatsApp and other social media messaging apps led to the demise of SMS services. WhatsApp pay is effectively going to eat into Mobile Moneys market share one way or another.
 However, Telecom companies know very well the effects of disruptive technologies. In Nigeria, during peak hours, Telecoms drop so many calls and people now use WhatsApp voice call capability. This lost revenue can never be recouped back after all WhatsApp calls are free and of high quality.
 However, WhatsApp pay will not be the downfall of mobile money in my opinion. WhatsApp pay favours those with existing bank accounts like SMEs. Remember WhatsApp for Business is an innovation made to help small businesses communicate better with their clients and WhatsApp pay will quickly provide an alternative way to pay for the comfort of wherever you are.
 Mobile money, on the other hand, is an innovation that does not only cater to small Businesses but it is a preferred Bank of choice for the rural masses. If one was to send money to their grandparents in the Village, the chance is that they would definitely use a mobile payment platform. I predict that Telecoms will most likely create an API that will integrate their mobile payment marvel of a solution to WhatsApp pay.
 Mobile money has made many inroads in Africa and it will take an act of God for WhatsApp Pay to dislodge it. Facebook Groups is the reason why OLX is closing shop in Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya but WhatsApp Pay might not be able to replicate its parent company’s success.

"PwC insurance survey signals opportunities for Africa&#8217;s insurtech startups
","This week, PwC released a report  from its survey  that focuses on Africas insurance industry with findings that signal opportunities for Africas insurtech startup. The findings of the report show that the industry is evolving. They also point out a couple of new opportunities.
 The opportunities for growth in Africa’s insurance industry are huge despite recent economic and political uncertainty, the press release reads.
 The report also hints at the potential and the relevance of technology when it comes to building an insurance industry for the future.
 Victor Muguto, Long-term Insurance Leader for PwC Africa, said:
 
 The insurance industry across Africa continues to be one of the most disrupted, but at the same time, the industry continues to innovate and adapt to take advantage of the many opportunities for growth that are also emerging.
 
 Technology is a key driver of the industry according to the report. Across all of Africa, the increased use of technology, on the back of the exponential growth of mobile phones, has significantly contributed to a large number of new customers and more tailored products.
 Yet, in some cases, the players are falling short when it comes to developing the necessary technology. One of the reasons is because it is expensive and not always easy for insurers to “go it alone”.

 This presents an opportunity to insurtech startups in form of startup-corporate collaborations. Startups like Jamii and Bismart that are developing mobile insurance products are potential candidates for this.
 This could be in form of a partnership or strategic investment. It would save the players in the insurance industry from spending tonnes of money on coming up with such products internally.
 Additionally, in the survey, insurers highlighted talent shortages as a top issue. The notable areas were technology and actuarial skills.
 This, again, presents an opportunity for the acquisition of insurtech startups like Naked Insurance that bring transparency to the insurance process as well as Pineapple that offers peer-to-peer insurance. These kinds of acquisitions would be focused more on talent than the product.

"The facts and fictions about innovation and technology hubs in Africa
","I don’t want to be the one who spoils the party but we have done enough counting of the technology hubs in Africa. Its thus high-time we moved to the outcome and impact of having these hubs.
 This includes; the number of investable startups, skilled workforce, investment raised and meaningful partnerships. These should be the new measurement of progress and success of the African innovation ecosystem.
 By February 2019, I would have marked exactly 7 years in the African innovation and tech ecosystem. During that time, I have published a few tools, written some blogs and trained in a few courses. In the same period, I tried my level best to share my personal experience in the best way I can. This has been through my work with three innovation hubs. I supported in the launching of a few others and currently owning one  Sahara Ventures.
 While listening to an interview of Shola Akinlade of Paystack  who currently is being hosted at YC  a question came into my mind. After 10 plus years of the hubs revolution in Africa, to what extent have we been able to support entrepreneurs and generate concrete success stories in numbers?
 The question doesn’t mean to undermine the effort. But rather to find out if what we are doing is enough. Because, Paystack, in a period of 2 years at YC, is a completely different company.
 Now, can we create programs that can actually transform our entrepreneurs in residence? If not, what are we missing?
 The innovation ecosystem in Africa has evolved and a lot has happened in the past few years. From the early days of White African Blog, Savannah Fund, iHub, Kinu Co-creation Hub, Pivot East, BRCK, and more. To now companies getting acquired and some raising million dollars across the continent.
 Also read: Silicon Valley: Invest in Africa, But Do It Differently
 Some might think we are already in the promised land. Yet, if you do enough analysis on where or how these companies that receive investments are emerging, you will realize that very few have actually been supported by the local hubs to at least reach the mezzanine stage.
 Very few hubs, out of the 400+ mentioned by different reports, can stand proud and tall, exclaiming we are responsible for the African Unicorn X. And add that through their technical support and mentoring it is how they have managed to reach there.
 Most of the founders of successful “African Unicorns” might have some associations with the local hubs, but not necessarily supported by them.
 Founders of these successful companies actually share a few traits in common. For example, they have a strong corporate background, went to good schools, they are coming back home after staying for years abroad, they have a strong network or work with foreign co-founders.
 They really don’t have much to do with the local hubs. Except for attending events and meetups. In turn, the hubs also don’t benefit much from their success either, leave aside their existence.
 This is because such founders use consulting firms to get themselves to be investor ready. They very rarely expect to get these services from our local hubs. Yet, while the local hubs claim to support these entrepreneurs, the facts say otherwise.
 Normally what these hubs support are “want-preneurs”. These are very early stage entrepreneurs. Yet, very rarely do we transform them into entrepreneurs with investable businesses.
 You can argue that different hubs have different objectives. And that, therefore, might not be your core mission. But the question then is; What is your core mission? Are you creating employable youths? If that is so, how many employable youths have been created from your programs so far? Beyond them attending hackathons and meetups at the hub? How do you measure progress?
 Also read: What you need to know about the Tanzania Innovation Ecosystem
 As much as a lot has happened in the ecosystem, nothing much has changed about an average African tech Hub. Many are still operating without clear business models. The services offered to the entrepreneurs are still average. Very few have been able to attract investment. Very few investor ready startups are emerging from them. Very few have been able to make meaningful partnerships. And, very few have programs with measurable outcomes.
 Most hubs are still surviving on grants and founders bootstrapping their way out. No wonder, while more hubs are created, even more, are dying.
 Organizations such as Infodev, DIY Toolkit, NESTA, and others have been developing tools, resources, and communities of practice. These are to help hub managers to find better ways to run and manage the hubs commercially. While ensuring they are creating an impact on the ground. But, are we using these resources? Are we spending enough time to develop strategic approaches to run these hubs? I’m not so sure.
 I think most of us just copy business models from the old hubs. The mostly failed models of other African hubs. We don’t have programs with measurable outcomes and don’t track progress. What we do is live on hype and old success stories, if any.
 This year, we reviewed companies for Sahara Sparks investor session. In total, we received 204 startup applications from five African countries, including applications from the KINGS. In total, they came from eight different innovation hubs.
 Early 2013, Helping a Team at Buni Innovation Hub. Three People In This Picture Have Very Interesting Stories to Tell.
 With confidence, I can say that over 90 percent of the startups were not investor ready. They couldn’t even prepare basic documents like an Investor Deck.
 The question that was going through my mind was, what is the point of having all these accelerators and business incubators if we can’t get startup ready for moments like these? If we are building investor networks, what are they going to invest in?
 To be honest, how we define ourselves online is very different from what is happening on the ground. There is a lot of talk and less of doing.
 This is not to say that nothing is happening. What I think is that we should put our facts together. Although I like the way the hub ecosystem has been growing, lets not confuse growth with progress. Don’t confuse quantity with quality.
 We still have a lot of gaps to fill. Maybe we are asking a lot from the hubs. But, for sure, there is a lot of work that needs to be done by our hubs. That is if we are to achieve real growth and progress.
 
 If you close your eyes to facts, you will learn through accidents. ~ African proverb
 
 I’m not a Messiah of the hubs, but here are a few things that might help us to progress from where we are now.
 Programs and Activities
 Hubs lack programs with measurable outcomes. We love short-term activities. Very few hubs have well-structured programs for supporting entrepreneurs. And we are not even tracking their progress or documenting their learning.
 Most hubs do one-off pitching events, meetups, partners events, or hackathons. They dont even invest much in designing and implementing longer (meaningful) programs. Programs that can actually help to prepare an entrepreneur beyond pitching.
 All successful business incubators and accelerators  think YC, TechStars and 500 Startups  have comprehensive programs to support entrepreneurs. They don’t do one-off events and jump on everything else that comes on their side.
 Skills and Experience
 Many hubs still lack people with the right skills and experience to help businesses grow. It’s normal to find one or two individuals with the required skills and experience. But, the rest of the management supporting team are amateurs. They dont have enough experience to offer technical or business support to these startups.
 No wonder most of our startups are not investor ready. The teams that are supposed to get them to that stage don’t have the highly needed experience and skills to do that. The next time you open a hub make sure you have a strong support team or empower your existing team. There is a lot of material and resources online for that.
 Mentoring and Technical Support
 While you will hear most startups complaining about gaps in finance and lack of investment funds, most times you will find out that that is 10 percent of the problem. The bigger problem is the lack of mentoring and professional advice.
 African hubs need to partner with mentor networks or even create one if they don’t exist. There are free guidelines online on how to build mentors and investors networks. Encourage your teams to read and get exposed.
 This is crucial if we want to have beyond average startups. Startup founders need to be advised by people with enough experience to run and manage businesses.
 Business Model and Sustainability Plan
 While new hubs are starting, the old ones are dying. Very few document the reason for their death. While those starting new ones don’t care much about learning from others mistakes.
 Yet, it is important to figure out this puzzle. How do we get our hubs to run as a business and have a sustained impact?
 Most hubs are still relying on membership fees, grants, project management and the like. Very few make money from their core mission of supporting startups. I don’t have a magic formula for this but its worth seating down with your team and reflecting on this.
 Meaningful Partnerships
 The number one reason for the failure of most hubs in Africa is to try to do everything. They want to be the university, the government, the consulting firm and finally the business incubator. You can not do it all.
 You need to find partners that will add value to your core mission. It is good to evolve and explore new things but you can’t be changing every day. What do you want to do? Where do you see yourself in a few years? What kind of partners do you need to reach there?
 This is food for thought. You might have already figured out all these things with your hub but I’m very sure there is a new hub out there that might enjoy this article. Please share.

"A Conversation with TMS Ruge, Co-Founder of Hive Colab
","TMS Ruge is one of the pivotal personalities in the startup ecosystem in East Africa. Although he spent many years studying and living in North America, he seemingly never left his country of birth. He is a prolific voice in international development discourse and a champion for the promise of technology in Uganda’s development.
 But he doesn’t stop at discourse, he practices what he preaches. He is the co-founder of Hive Colab, launched the rise of Uganda’s tech incubator and co-working spaces. Apart from supporting other startups, he is also behind a number of startups in various market sectors.
 Notably, he is the founder and CEO of Raintree Farms  a Masindi based agri-cuetical Company focused on medicinal crops, as well as a co-founder at Remit – an online remittances platform.
 Ruge has not only seen the ecosystem from its inception but been at the center of it. I caught up with him and we shared a lot in a conversation that lasted more than half an hour.
 External Validation
 If you have ever talked to Ruge, heard him speak anywhere, or followed his ‘rants’ on twitter, then you know that he is a proud African and an ardent advocate for self-determination.
 One of the issues we discussed was the fact that many Africans (black to be specific) still feel they need an outsider (white to be specific) to believe in something before it is considered up-to-standard, viable or good enough.
 This has, in turn, bred what has come to be known as “white fronting” where a white person is brought onto the startup team to go around the difficulties that come with running a startup as a black person. A couple of African startup founders, looking for external funding or market validation, have ended up taking this route.
 When asked about it, he says “this issue spreads not only across just technology but everything. Our very individual identity and development hinges on this slave mentality. This colonized mentality where we need outside validation in order to think for ourselves”.
 On the very day we had the conversation, he tweeted that morning that there was a meeting where Korean businessmen were teaching the Ugandan parliament on how to love Uganda.
 Also, read: Meet Dr. Davis Musinguzi and his Passion to digitize the Health Care Industry in Africa
 
 This is a thing that happened with our parliamentarians. How to love your country! Do you really need to be taught that? Do you need that validation from an outside source? We are waiting to be told how to wash our feet. Its like you [a fellow black man] telling me [to do something] is not enough, I need that guy [who is foreign] to come and tell me in order for me to believe it  Ruge
 
 He went on to reveal that “one of the problems we faced starting Remit was this very mentality. We couldnt get trust with our own people. The first responses were like ‘you guys are frauds. You guys want to steal my money’ from people that had never even tried the [online remittances] system”.
 Customers weren’t willing to try it out at all because the platform was made in Uganda and was innovated by Ugandans. Therefore, in their thinking, the thing was fake”.
 According to Ruge, these doubters are the same people buying fake things from China thinking because it is foreign, then it must be good. This trend not only makes us our own worst enemy, it is also stifling innovation by Africans.
 If you look at our demographic statistics alone, we are in a lot of trouble if this mentality continues. If we are going to develop and break out of this dependency cycle, weve got to think differently.
 Yet, Ruge believes this trend can be reversed if Africans are willing to cheer on their own. They should be able to front and celebrate any success attained. This should also be followed up by constructive criticism for improvements to be made.
 Expat Founders
 Having talked about White-fronting, we were also prompted to discuss the issue of Expat founders. This also stemmed from the fact that a report from GALI stated that “foreign (typically US-based) investors in emerging markets find it easier to invest in expat founders.”
 Asked whether the report used Expat founder to mean whiter founder, Ruge exclaimed, “Absolutely right! Theres no way most startups in Africa were going to get funding without those [white] guys”. He also adds that that’s why there is the white-fronting strategy among African startups in order to be able to get some funding.
 To Ruge,
 
 “money follows like. It stays in circles that it understands. It rarely ventures out in circles it doesnt understand, and when it does that, the only time it breaks that paradigm is when it is guilt driven. When it is alleviating guilt for the money holder in the form of donations.”
 
 He also points out that it is easy for the very people to give donations yet when asked to convert that into risk capital for African founders, the bar is set very high.
 “To invest [in Africa] means they have something they want to buy. And [that] shutters their perspective of what Africa is and what it is capable of, adds Ruge.
 In conclusion, Ruge says “the people that are coming in as expat founders actually understand that [the funders have that kind of mindset]. They know that it is easier for them [white founders] to actually raise money here. They see an opportunity where others [Africans] have failed to accelerate. A person comes in here with an idea same as Remit but it is easier for them to raise capital.”
 Local Capital
 Speak to a couple of African startup founders about their challenges, and you’ll find that access to funding is on top of the list – at least for the majority.
 When asked if there’s money in Africa, Ruge says “theres money here.” However, to him, what were are missing is the vision.
 “You see all these buildings going up. We have the money, we are lacking vision and lacking taste. People have money but just dont know exactly what to do with it. Peoples mindsets have been tuned to real estate, he adds.
 Ideally, in Africa, we call an investment something that one can see and touch. When it comes to digital and tech investments, people who have the money are yet to catch up. He says “for our sector (tech), it is going to be impossible to raise capital if thats the mentality.”
 That kind of mentality of not thinking outside the box of the types of investments that are still holding back local investment in startups. However, with time and a few success stories, Ruge says “people will be asking questions like ‘you mean you can actually invest in this thing and it returns money?’”
 It is a matter of giving them the numbers of what it means to actually invest in a startup, tell them what a digital economy is and what the potential is.

"Here are 5 tech hubs that launched in East Africa this year
","African tech hubs have grown in number by 40% in the last two years.  A total of 442 active incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces were reported as of early March 2018. This is according to GSMAs Tech Landscape report for the year.  
 East Africa alone has seen the launch of at least 5 tech hubs this year. Lets profile them, their services, and membership terms.
 Uganda: The Tech Hub
 The Tech Hub Incubator is a product of a partnership between Ortus LLP, KTA Advocates, and Techccelarate Company Limited. We have merged legal sector expertise with business needs for a startup venture, reads a statement on the hub website.
 Launched in May 2018, and located at Park Royal Building along Buganda Road in Kampala, the hub provides co-working space, business incubation, acceleration as well as legal support.
 Membership starts at UGX 500,000 (about $135) per month for personal full day access or dedicated seating. Dedicated seats for a group of 4 go for UGX 1.8 million (about $500), while a personal virtual office is rated at UGX 300,000 (about $80).
 The hub recently hosted a HiiL Justice event.

 Tanzania: Safe Space Co.
 Safe Space started in the first quarter of 2017 as a comprehensive community for female entrepreneurs and female-led startups in Tanzania. The hub is located along Haile Selassie road in Dar es Salaam.
 It offers desk space for entrepreneurs, individual and group coaching programs, as well as inspiration and support for members.

"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and GV-backed Startup, Andela, Launches Ugandan Cohort
","Andela, a global engineering organisation which got a $24M backing from the Chan Zukerberg Initiative in 2016  with additional investors like GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Omidyar, Peak Ventures etc. -organized an information sharing session last evening at The Innovation Village, Kampala.
 The aim of the session was to help Ugandan developers understand its activities better and seek opinions from the same people on how it can improve its operations in the country and region. The session was moderated by Adam Lupu, Andela’s Vice President for Learning, with over 20 entrepreneurs and developers in attendance.
 Its at this event that they hinted on extending their operation to Uganda and announced a call for applications of the first Andela Uganda Cohort. Further information which we received by email from Maria Kyamulabye- the Launch Operations Lead Uganda- confirms that the deadline for the application is 1st April 2017.
 However, they plan to start with informational sessions in Kampala to ensure they study the business climate in Uganda first. They’re therefore likely to start with a staff of just two who will most likely sit at the Innovation Village – a place theyre considering for office space.
 As they continue to do this, they encourage Ugandan developers to apply to its program. Successful candidates shall then be invited for interviews and a boot camp – here in Uganda. Those that succeed past this stage will be sent to Nairobi, Kenya for further 6 months of training – after which they will work in a distributed manner for Andelas clients such as Google etc.
 Andela which has offices both in Nigeria and Kenya, received considerable media attention after Zuckerberg visited the Nigeria office in August just after the investment from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Some of the companies Andela is working with include Microsoft, SeatGeek, 2U, 6Sense and many more.
 Andela quoted as harder to get into than Harvard is one of the most difficult. In fact, Solomon Kitumba – the community coordinator of the innovation Village confessed to have failed to complete the application form on 4 different occasions. Moreover its estimated that for every intake, over 1000 applications are received but only 1% get into the program.
 Asked what Ugandan entrepreneurs and developers can do to increase their chances of gaining admission, Adam Lupu, the VC for Learning had this to say;
 “Team work. We value team work a lot at Andela. Therefore, if one would like to join us, I advise them to start working on projects in teams in order to increase their chances.
 Adam Lupu also emphasized that one of the plans in Uganda is to collaborate with existing ecosystem such as hubs and universities to ensure growth of the tech craft. To this, he confirmed that he is going to spend the larger part of this Friday visiting and networking with the various universities in Kampala. This will come in handy given that most of the attendants with an IT background complained that IT graduates in Uganda are mainly equipped with theory.
 Given that Andela has been operating in only two African cities – Lagos and Nairobi  it’s launch of the Uganda Cohort will be more than welcome to Ugandan developers who have always turned down the opportunity on ground that they have other commitments which would not allow them to travel for recruitment purposes needed to qualify for in the four years program.

"Students Who Watched Queen of Katwe Performed Better
","In a study carried out by Oxfords Emma Riley, it was found that students who watched Queen of Katwe before their national exams significantly performed better than their peers.
 This was established in Emmas paper titled Increasing students’ aspirations: the impact of Queen of Katwe on students’ educational attainment. The study involved two groups of students in candidate classes of S.4 and S.6. The two separate groups of students from each class were treated to two different movies.
 One group watched Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, a fantasy story about children with paranormal abilities while another watched Queen of Katwe, the aspirational story of a young girl, Phiona Mutesi, from the slums of Kampala’s rise out of poverty to become a world chess champion. The film Queen of Katwe is based on a true story.
 Emma found that watching an aspirational movie, with a potential role model, leads to a 0.11 standard deviation increase in maths performance for S4 students, with the effect coming from students being 11 percentage points less likely to fail the exam.
 According to the paper, this effect is being driven by the lowest ability and students at lower ranked schools. For S6 students, their total score on their exams increases by 0.13 standard deviations. This study highlights the power of a role model as a cost-effective way to improve secondary school students’ educational attainment, particularly of the worst performing students.
 The paper concludes by saying that exposing secondary school students to a movie featuring a potential role model who could raise aspirations improves national exam performance.
 This study is very important given that according to a paper published by Kavuma in 2015 (one of the references cited by Emma Riley), in Uganda, education is a key way to escape from poverty. Those finishing secondary education with good grades are set to earn 78% more than those with just primary education, and those with university education earn 170% more.

"Meet Kafeero Aziizi, The Founder of Kafeero Foundation
","At 18 years, Kafeero Aziizi founded the first online food delivery startup in Uganda. It collapsed after 2 years. This he followed up with many other unsuccessful startups. Yet, it is from this experience that he learned a lot on why many startups fail and very few succeed.
 He thus made the decision to inspire young entrepreneurs in Uganda and across Africa.
 
 Most of the startups don’t lack money, but rather lack mentors, cutting edge knowledge and skills. This is what made me start Kafeero Foundation  to see that we can give the skills and knowledge needed to succeed and also help many youths find jobs  Aziizi
 
 Kafeero Foundation is a social enterprise whose sole purpose is to inspire individuals and economies to grow through innovation. In an exclusive interview with Kafeero Aziizi, he was able to share with us more about his vision for the Foundation.
 Also read: Meet Aisha Ali, the Founder of I Profile Foundation
 
 
 What is the most important thing youre working on right now, and how are you making it happen?
 Currently, as a foundation, we are running a GOOGLE DIGITAL SKILLS INITIATIVE FOR
 AFRICA in partnership with CENTUM LEARNING. The program is targeted to take
 1 million African startups online. We are doing the training in 21 African Countries.
 
 Why is now the time for your foundation to exist?
 Africa is the world’s fastest-growing continental economy, and its B2B market is a
 major. In 2015, companies in Africa spent $2.6 trillion, which is just less one-third
 of the $8.5 trillion spent by Chinese companies last year and slightly more than
 the $2.3 trillion Indian companies spent. Over the next several years, B2B
 spending in Africa is expected to increase by nearly 50 percent, reaching $3.5
 trillion in 2025. Also, Africa has a young, growing population and the fastest urbanization rate in the world. By 2034, the region is expected to have a larger workforce than either
 China or India—and so far, job creation is outpacing growth in the labor force hence the need to develop human capital.
 
 What was your very first program like? And how far have you expanded since then?
 Our first program was a quite challenging and we had no resource available but only
 faith and belief that whatever we had set out to do would come through. We
 started with a team of 3 people and within our first 2 months, we had grown to 10.
 Our growth is outrageous and today we are up to 30 core foundation members, about 120 volunteers and more than 50 freelancers in different professions.
 
 How do you develop your talent? What kind of person is the right person for Kafeero Foundation?
 Kafeero foundation is a place of disruptors. We see no barriers and no challenges
 big enough. So any young, talented, creative, intuitive and ambitious person is
 invited. We all start with volunteer-ship where we are able to understand
 different people and give them necessary skills before we fully recruit them.
 Our culture is built on Love and service for humanity. We value others as much as we
 value ourselves
 
 What do you love about your team, and why are you the ones to solve this problem?
 Our team is young, creative and very innovative. They also understand the challenges of our time. We are very committed to supporting our fellow youth across Africa through innovation and we have a passion for development and unemployment issues.
 
 How many hours a day do you commit to Kafeero Foundation and why?
 I commit 20 hours to the foundation daily. The world is changing fast with this digital age, information is shared in just microseconds and a lot of disruptive startups are
 coming up from anywhere and changing things. On the other hand, a lot of big brands are closing down daily because they cannot re-invent themselves. So a young organization like ours needs to think fast and act faster. We have a very young creative and dynamic team that cant allow me to just sleep but create value every minute for now.
 
 At the moment, how do you measure success? What is your metrics?
 
 We measure our success through impact. Were impact driven not just strategies. We go out and engage the young people to start businesses. So far, we have created a number of startups and also supported many with skills and we track their impact on a monthly basis to see how many other young people theyre reaching in terms of creating jobs or skilling. So far we have reached more than 40,000 young people through different programs in a space of one year. We have more than 2000 micro-startups directly trained both online and at our HUB. Over 32 successful projects recorded so far and creating employment for other unemployed youths.
 
 Whats most exciting about your traction to date?
 Being able to scale across Africa and also seeing young unemployed youths start their own businesses and employ each other.
 
 Whats your biggest threat?
 Failing to be part of the generation that solved Africa’s problems
 
 If you werent running Kafeero Foundation, what would you be doing?
 I don’t think I would be doing anything else, this is my life.
 
 How well did you know what you were doing in terms of planning, strategy, partnerships and how to raise funding when you were starting Kafeero Foundation?
 I had no idea at all. All I knew is that I wanted to change lives and it was one at a time. Strategies and plans kept changing based on the challenges and opportunities at hand.
 
 Who is funding you? 
 The foundation has a designing studio brand called Lionnaires which is a commercial
 brand studio that equips startups with essential brand assets. We create brands that
 roar and last for generations. Lionnaires offers digital marketing and branding services to different companies and startups. We also thrive more on social entrepreneurs/ leaders that are passionate about our causes and support our work both directly and indirectly.
 
 Any 5 books/Movies you recommend for fellow founders/entrepreneurs?
 1. Steve Jobs; Walter Isaacson
 2. Africans Investing in Africa; Tony Elumelu
 3. The Lean startup; Eric Ries
 4. Warren Buffet’s Annual Letters
 5. Disrupting Africa: The Rise and Rise of African Innovation; Nnamde Oranye
 
 After all is said and done, I hope to see Africa that is managed by Africans.

"Toyota set to invest $500 million into Uber to work on self-driving cars
","Toyota is set to invest $500 Million into ride-hailing company, Uber, to work on self-driving cars according to Reuters.
 Toyota Motor Corp will invest $500 million in Uber to jointly work on developing self-driving cars, the companies said on Monday [27/082018], Reuters wrote.
 As per competition, both Toyota and Uber are widely lagging behind the competition when it comes to developing self-driving cars. Therefore, this deal is said to be aimed at helping both companies catch up with rivals in the hotly competitive autonomous driving business.
 Also read: Takuma’s Leapfrog Ventures invests $50,000 in Kenya’s BiasharaBot
 Furthermore, it will also breathe life into Ubers self-driving business that was beginning to stagnate in the recent past.
 Since a self-driving Uber SUV killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March, Uber has removed its robot cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona, its autonomous testing hub, Reuters wrote.
 The investment will come in at a valuation of $72 Billion. And according to Reuters, this is the same exact valuation at which Alphabet [Googles parent company], made an investment into Uber earlier this year through Waymo  its self-driving unit.
 As part of the deal, Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota’s Guardian technology. According to Uber, the combined technology will be built into Toyota’s Sienna minivans, to be deployed on Uber’s ride-hailing network starting in 2021.
 The companies’ aim is to solve the enormously challenging problem of how to mass produce self-driving cars for shared fleets, including ride-hailing services.
 Jeff Miller, Uber’s head of business development for strategic initiatives, said the partnership “really paints the picture of how we envision deploying autonomous technology in the long term.” That includes licensing its autonomous technology to carmakers and enlisting a third party to own and maintain the fleet.
 This isnt the first strategic partnership or investment that Uber is striking in its close to a decade lifetime.
 Uber has a deal to purchase cars from Volvo, outfit them with Uber’s technology and maintain them. They also have a partnership with Daimler AG (parent company for Mercedes), in which the carmaker proposes to put its own self-driving cars in Uber’s ride-hailing network.

"MTN lists on Nigeria Stock Exchange, becomes second most valuable company
","The Nigerian arm of African mobile telecommunications behemoth MTN Group Limited today listed its business on the Nigeria Stock Exchange. MTN Nigeria Communications Plc. went live at 2:14 pm local time, allowing trading for only 16 minutes before the markets closed.
 In that short period, however, the company was able to become the second most valuable entity on the stock exchange. Offering its shares at $0.25, the telecom company saw a 10 percent rise in this price.
 By 2.30 pm, the company was worth $5.54 billion, ranking behind only Aliko Dangote’s Dangote Cement which commands an $8.3 billion valuation.
 Running under the MTNN ticker, the company only listed 20 billion ordinary shares instead of going public through an IPO. MTN claims that this is because it would be quite difficult to get a fair valuation prior to the IPO given that it is still embroiled in a drawn-out dispute with regulatory authorities in Nigeria.
 Speaking to Bloomberg, MTN Chief Financial Officer Ralph Mupita was of the opinion that the company wouldn’t go public via IPO until it cleared an alleged tax bill of $2 billion.
 A similar story involving the company played out in Ghana, its third largest market. MTN had to go public via an IPO in order to get a license for rolling out a 4G network.
 Back in its largest market, the public listing turned around the dire fortunes of a faltering Nigerian Stock Exchange. After 8 days of losses on the trot, the MTN listing saw the market close half a percentage point up.
 This piece of good news could assuage public vitriol against the South African based wireless carrier. Across the continent, many believe the company repatriates huge profits back to its homeland instead of further investing them in the area of operations.
 News of an impending IPO will not only offer the public a part of the carrier but also help to paint the company in a better light. Currently, locals only own around 20 percent. With the IPO, there’s a chance to own 35 percent.

"Liquid telecom is slowly becoming a big player in Africa&#8217;s tech hub space
","According to GSMA, telecoms are some of the pillars onto which African tech hubs stand. According to its recently released 2018 report, there are 442 tech hubs in African. Yet, 13% of these were partnering with mobile operators to ensure they thrive. (See: There are 442 active tech hubs in Africa, GSMA 2018 report)
 The report pointed out MTN, Orange, and Vodacom as the mobile operators leading the pack.
 But, Liquid Telecom, which was missing on the list seems to be slowly taking its place. The Econet Group company is securing partnerships with hubs across different African countries.
 According to Oswald Jumira, Liquid Telecom Group’s Head of Innovation Partnerships, they are currently partnering with 10 tech hubs across 7 African countries.
 They have partnerships with The Innovation Village (Uganda), Venture Labs (Uganda), Nairobi Garage (Kenya), Twig (Kenya), MSU Hub (Zimbabwe), Muzinda Hub (Zimbabwe), kLabs (Rwanda), Impact Hubs (Rwanda), NameYourHub (Tanzania) and BongoHive (Zambia).
 Additionally, the company is also supporting academic institutions.
 “We also support academic institutions across the continent and makerclubs such as Fundi Bots in Uganda and MakerClub in Zimbabwe,” Oswald Jumra wrote in an email.
 Also read: Uganda’s Outbox Hub partners with Kenya’s Moringa School
 On top of the above, Liquid telecom also has a couple of partnerships in the pipeline. These are with Pretoria Hub (South Africa), MEST Hub (South Africa), Sahara Sparks (Tanzania) and Impact Hub (Zimbabwe).
 In all these partnerships, they provide products and services aimed at mainly startups. We have built extensive infrastructure that African startups can leverage on to build their business, Oswald Jumira said.
 These range from the internet, skills development, funding for events, funding to startups through partners, as well as services from partners like Microsoft, especially cloud products like Microsoft Azure and Office 360.
 Oswald maintains that they are not running a CSR campaign or a non-for-profit program. Adding that these partnerships are profit initiatives that can self-sustain. “This is not a CSR initiative and is actually a profit driven initiative for sustainability,” he said.
 “We believe partnerships are key to our growth into the future and African founded and nurtured startups are the ones we are working with.
 Commenting on their partnership, Ck Japheth, the founder of The Innovation Village said that “Innovation is the new competition.”
 “Our partnership has a lot of benefits for us and our startups. For example, if a startup is to launch a new market where Liquid Telecom is, they give them a soft landing. Additionally, we are about to roll out cloud services for startups,” Ck Japheth said.
 While as telecoms and other enablers are continuing to support hubs across Africa, the GSMA report indicated that “in the past eighteen months, around eighty hubs have shut down across the two regions [of the Asia Pacific and Africa].”
 Read more: Liquid Telecom releases report on “the generation that will define Africa’s digital future”
 This is due to a lack of a perfect understanding of the uniqueness of each market. This implies that in all these partnerships, telecom companies ought not to only look out for their interests by providing anything they can. Rather, they should study what needs these hubs have and go ahead to provide exactly that.
 “One-size-fits-all business models, no matter how widely tested, are not necessarily successful in such fragmented markets,” read part of a statement in the GSMA 2018 report.

"Is Bribery why some winners of UCC&#8217;s ACIA awards haven&#8217;t received prizes yet?
","Last week [12/01/2018], James Wire Lunghabo tweeted that apparently some winners of the UCC organised ACIA awards havent been paid. He added that Mbu (a Luganda word meaning apparently) they might need to forfeit a 30% cut to you know who'. Of course, you know who implied the unofficial brokers in some government MDAs that stand in the way of anything until they are assured of a cut before speeding up the process.
 
 Apparently some winners of the @UCC_Official organised #ACIA awards havent been paid. Mbu they might need to forfeit a 30% cut to you know who.#WhistleBlowing
 — James Wire Lunghabo (@wirejames) January 12, 2018
 
 Responding to the allegations, through their official Twitter page, UCC said that All ACIA winners are aware that prizes are awarded to profess innovations only. This requires the innovators to develop project plans with clearly measurable milestones to which their prize releases will be made.
 In subsequent tweets, they also added that they have been engaging with the innovators to help them fine tune [sic] these work plans into MoUs which will guide their progress. Each of the innovators is at different stages of achieving their milestones and payments are made upon verification.
 
 UCC has zero tolerance for such behavior [sic] and welcomes the said winners who claim they haven’t been paid and are being asked for a bribe to inform the relevant authorities
 
 However, Ronald Ssebuhinja the founder of School Masters and a member of the ICT Association of Uganda interjected and challenged UCC to publish a full list of all the 2017 ACIA Awards winners with their milestones. Which seemed to imply that perhaps UCC was using the milestones explanation as a paper cover for the issue at hand  bribery.
 
 I doubt the @UCC_Official handler knows exactly whats going on. I challenge you to publish a list of the 2017 winners and their milestone status. If none of them has done enough to receive their prizes in 8 months, then explain why.
 — Ronald Sebuhinja K (@sebsronnie) January 13, 2018
 
 Three days later, James  who brought the issue to light, again tweeted that his efforts yielded some results as UCC scheduled a meeting with the award winners tomorrow [today].
 The rot has been exposed, he added.
 Which sparked a threaded reply from UCCs head of PR, Pamela Ankunda, accusing James of working so hard at trying to find non existing [sic] info about what you call whistleblowing'.
 
 James, I know you are working so hard at trying to find non existing info about what you call whistleblowing #ACIA. @UCC_Official has an open door policy where you can get all the https://t.co/KMmYrnFcsf though are the facts- plz follow the thread #ACIAFacts.
 — Pamela Ankunda (@Pamankunda) January 15, 2018
 
 She also went ahead and repeated the same earlier communication by UCCs official Twitter page insisting that all disbursements are milestones based. And dared James to produce any evidence to unearth the rot at UCC he was talking about.
 
 Disbursement of the #ACIA prize money is made in phases,based on milestones achieved and progress reports provided by the #Innovators.#UCC routenily assess the progress and verifies these milestones. We monitor and guide innovators. We are interested in seeing them fly higher.
 — Pamela Ankunda (@Pamankunda) January 15, 2018
 
 
 Please bring forward any evidence-youve had three days in a row to do it. We know who has made progress on their #Innovations, who is struggling, who is excelling. Beyond PR, our database is clean. Please visit #UCC at your own time and get more info.
 — Pamela Ankunda (@Pamankunda) January 15, 2018
 
 Pamela informed James that they know who gave James the side of the story. Which she followed up with asking James to tell that individual to to speed up his innovation, guide him, lets engage him and yes, hell pick his funding.
 
 We both know who has given you his side of the story. Other than generalise, ask him to speed up his innovation, guide him, lets engage him and yes, hell pick his funding. Unfortunately,it works that way.
 — Pamela Ankunda (@Pamankunda) January 15, 2018
 
 Though James maintained that he is working with over five innovators who havent received their prizes. Before concluding that instead of Pamela focusing her efforts on dispelling his allegations, she should clean her house instead.
 
 Dont get me there madam. Who has given me isnt the issue because Im dealing with at least five innovators, all disgruntled. Just clean your house. Stop the victimisation. @UCC_Official @FrankTumwebazek @UCC_ED @Tybisa @NITAUganda1 @Snottyganda @tomddumba @Dignited

 Later in the day [yesterday], UCC issued a statement  still on their Twitter page. It was basically explaining the genesis of the ACIAs, their role and how they award prizes. However, it didnt seem to point out specifically if there are any innovators they havent awarded yet and how they are handling it.
 The statement read;
 
 BRIEF ON ACIA WINNERS
 This is to inform that UCC has run the ACIA Awards initiative a platform for showcasing, recognizing, and promoting outstanding ICT innovations in Uganda. This initiative, aimed at promoting the development of indigenous ICT solutions has run successfully for 8 years. Winners have received various forms of support, enabling them further develop their innovations.
 Each year, a call is issued out, inviting innovators to responded [sic] to a predetermined challenge relating to a social economic issues [sic] faced by the public. The Call is structured under various categories to enable participation from as many groups as possible. Submitted applications are taken through a rigorous selection process before a shortlist of outstanding innovations is generated by a panel of distinguished judges comprising of eminent persons with knowledge and experience in innovation, ICTs, and business.
 The shortlisted innovators/finalists are invited to pitch their innovations before the panel of judges, who identify the winning innovations. The winners receive various prizes ranging from seed funding; innovation support; capacity building; exposure visits; equipment, etc. These prizes are intended to support the innovators to progress their innovations.
 Access to Prizes
 Winners under the ACIA Awards Initiative access prizes following achievement of agreed milestones contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the winners and UCC. This is to ensure that resources are utiliced [sic] for purposes of developing the ICT innovations. Milestones are tagged to the implementation Plans provided by the innovators. Disbursement of prize money is made in phases, based on milestones achieved and progress reports provided by the innovators. Routine assessment of progress made by the innovator is made to verify the milestones achieved.
 UCC also collaborates with leading ICT incubation services providers and incubation hubs like outbox, HiveColab for capacity building and incubation support services to selected winners. A tripartite MoU is signed between the Incubator, Innovator and UCC. The MoU also contains milestones that are tagged to the implementation plans. Achievement of the milestones forms the basis for disbursement of funds. The periodic follow up of winners is aimed to establish progress made and providing support where applicable. This includes making referrals to partners in the innovation ecosystem locally, regionally and globally.
 
 Albert Mucunguzi, the Chairman of the ICT Association of Uganda first responded to the statement by citing the spelling mistakes in it. Before issuing his own.
 In his statement, Albert pointed out that the timing of the [UCC] statement seems deliberately intended to coincide with the ongoing debate about whether or not individuals within UCC solicited bribes from past winners in order to facilitate access to their prizes.
 However, he said that UCCs attempt  through the statement  to explain the process of access to prize looks like an attempt to dismiss James Wire’s [bribery] allegations. Read Alberts Statement here.
 Earlier on, Vincent Bagiire, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance had interjected the back and forth between James and Pamela. He assured James that the ministry is engaging with UCC to establish the cause of delays with a view of addressing the innovators concerns. And promised to communicate the outcome as soon as possible.
 
 @wirejames we are engaging with @UCC_Official to establish cause of delays with a view of addressing the innovators concerns. Thereafter, we shall communicate to all concerned ASAP. @FrankTumwebazek https://t.co/RUR8FnqYjs
 — Vincent Bagiire (@Tybisa) January 15, 2018
 
 If it turns out to be a case of bribery, it would have done a dent in the credibility of the awards as some people already had a belief that one cant win and if they won cant get their prize.
 
 Its true.. Seeding funds are never paid If paid then you cant get full payment They just keep the puzzle puzzling. If you win seeding fund And after wining they again set milestones to get it Its all crap

"Communicate in a language that government officials and policymakers understand, Minister Frank Tumwebaze Tells Innovators
","Yesterday, Swarm Summit 2017  an event that brings together tech and startup stakeholders in Uganda  took place at The Square Place in Industrial Area, Kampala. It was at the event that Hon. Frank Tumwebaze, the minister for ICT and National Guidance advised innovators and their supporters to revise their mode of communication.
 He advised them to tailor their proposals and communications in a way that government officials and policymakers can easily understand. The minister said this while on a panel that was discussing Creating an Enabling Environment for Innovation in Uganda. Which came immediately after him giving the opening remarks to officially open the two-day summit running from the 7th to 8th December.
 
 
 Tell them how your innovations and solutions will impact the GDP, Jobs or something they understand, the minister said.
 
 
 He said this in defence of the analogy that it is currently hard to engage government ministries, departments, and agencies regarding innovations and local solutions. However, TMS Ruge  the co-founder of Hive Colab, later argued that actually, how about the government employed people that can understand the language innovators use?
 On the same panel, the minister was joined by Richard Zulu, the founder of Outbox Hub but representing the Association of Uganda Innovation and Tech Hubs  BICU, Albert Mucunguzi, the Chairman of the ICT Association of Uganda, Joshua Akandwanaho from NITA Uganda and Maria Kyamulabye from Andela Uganda.
 Richard Zulu and Albert Mucunguzi, being heads of associations, emphasized the essence of unity and coming together to ensure a robust ecosystem is built to support startups and technology. Richard Zulu cited an example of an association like Kampala City Traders Association (KACITA) which can access anyone in the government, the president included.
 This, however, did not sit well with the minister who thought they were trying to politicize the issue. Instead, he urged them to always ensure they engage him and other necessary parties before any hardcore steps are taken. He also cited a few successes that have resulted out of this sort of arrangement.
 Several other panels discussing issues affecting the tech and startup ecosystem in Uganda as well as how to forge a way forward wrapped up the day. These included a panel on Building the Connectivity Infrastructure for Uganda’s Digital Economy which was moderated by James Wire Lunghabo. Followed by an all-female one on The Importance Of Diversity In The Digital Economy moderated by Barbara Birungi Mutabaazi.
 To wind up the day, a Tech Journalist Round Table was moderated by Patricia Kahill. They dissected the top stories of the year as well as their predictions for the year 2018.
 The summit will be closing today with panels on Building investible technology Startups in Uganda, Social Media as Change Catalyst, Realizing the Fintech Opportunity in Uganda’s Emerging Digital Economy, and The State of Hardware Innovation in Uganda.

"MultiChoice Group lists on the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange
","MultiChoice Group Limited (MCG) today listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The listed MCG includes MultiChoice South Africa (MCSA), MultiChoice Africa Holdings (MAH), Showmax, as well as the global digital platform security provider Irdeto, and all their subsidiaries and affiliates (MultiChoice Group). The company announced the plans last year in September.
 As Africa’s most loved storyteller, MultiChoice Group brings leading local and international entertainment and sports content to around 14-million households in 50 African markets, providing viewers with access to content from 8 out of 10 major international studios. Importantly, MCG is differentiated by its production of over 4,500 hours of local content in 10 studios across Africa. Showmax alone has 17,500 hours of content with half being local content. Furthermore, MCG offers a world of champions with over 37 sports channels providing sports fans viewership of most iconic global sports events.
 Calvo Mawela, Group CEO, commented: “Today’s listing is an important milestone in our exciting journey of growth. As one of the fastest growing pay-TV broadcast providers globally, our strong financial position at listing is backed by attractive long-term growth opportunities in both subscriber numbers and revenue. MCG has a high cash generative core with no financial debt, and we are poised to deliver value to our shareholders over time.”
 While MCG continues to drive incremental mass-market growth in its South African base, the business on the rest of the continent has stabilised with a value strategy driving operational and financial improvements. Moreover, there is a meaningful scope to drive up pay-TV penetration in the rest of Africa in the mid to mass market while the connected video services represent a fast-growing, longer-term opportunity.
 The cutting-edge innovation of Irdeto, our global digital platform security company, further underpins our competitive position. Irdeto provides a world-class technical capability to MCG as a global leader in protecting platforms and applications for video entertainment, video games, connected transport and IoT connected industries. Irdeto is independently profitable with more than 400 global clients including Airtel, Charter, Electronic Arts, Fox, Foxtel, IBM Security, KPN, Liberty Global, Premier League, Tata Sky, Warner Brothers, XPENG. Irdeto allows MCG to rapidly deploy the world’s best technology to global customers and generate a healthy revenue stream.
 The listing and impending unbundling of MCG by Naspers Limited reinforces the commitment of both MCG and Naspers Limited to broad, socio-economic transformation in South Africa. Phuthuma Nathi (PN) shareholders will be allocated an additional 5% stake in MultiChoice South Africa (MCSA) for no consideration, thereby increasing their indirect interest in MCSA from 20% to 25%, and result in a 25% increase in PN’s share of MultiChoice dividend flows. Through PN, MCSA has provided long-term, far-reaching benefits to 90,000 individual and institutional B-BBEE shareholders, with a return on investment of approximately 17 times since inception.
 Bob van Dijk, Naspers Chief Executive Officer, commented:
 “Today is a proud day for Naspers. Listing MultiChoice Group through an unbundling unlocks value for Naspers shareholders by creating the opportunity for them to own a direct stake in MultiChoice Group, a top-40 JSE-listed African entertainment group. We are also very pleased to be able to create further value for Phuthuma Nathi shareholders, who, through MultiChoice South Africa, have already participated in one of South Africa’s most successful empowerment schemes. As MultiChoice Group embarks on its next exciting chapter I look forward to seeing the team build further on their impressive success story.”
 Mawela concluded:
 “We are overwhelmingly positive about MultiChoice Group’s future. With the largest pay-TV footprint across Africa, we understand our customers and tailor our offering and services to suit market-specific video entertainment needs. This, coupled with a leading content offering, world-class technology and infrastructure, pan-African scale and strong in-country capabilities, positions us well to generate shareholder returns and future growth.”

 — useremit (@RemitUg) March 10, 2018
 In February, Useremit wrote on its Facebook page that March is coming with a lot of changes here at useremit. And focusing on intra-Africa money remittances must be one of them if not the only one.
 The amount of money remitted to Africa has been steadily growing ever since it dipped in 2016. Remittances to the continent are projected to hit around $39.2 billion this year and $39.6 billion in 2019 according to the World Bank.
 
 However, the cost of remitting money to Africa is the highest compared to other parts of the World. WorldRemit, DusuPay and Flutterwave are some of the major players in the African money remittances business.
 Most money remittance service providers currently focus on the Africa diaspora community. Ignoring the intra-African opportunity. According to Send Money Africa, sending money across Africa is almost twice as it is to send to Africa. Stating that the top 10 most expensive corridors [for sending money] are predominantly intra-African.
 While as it costs 9.1% to send money to Africa as of 2017 Q3, according to the World Bank, the cost of remitting money between South Africa and Botswana stood at 19.86 percent in Q4 of 2016 according to Send Money Africa. Making it the most expensive corridor in the world.
 Theres still a lot of potentials to be explored when it comes to remittances within Africa. Especially sub-Saharan Africa. Within sub-Saharan, the South African and Tanzanian corridors remain the most expensive to remit money in.
 Of the top 10 most expensive corridors in the World, 9 are between the South African and Tanzanian corridors. These include; South Africa to Botswana, South Africa to Angola, South Africa to Lesotho, South Africa to Swaziland, Tanzania to Uganda, South Africa to Zambia, South Africa to Malawi, Tanzania to Rwanda and South Africa to Mozambique.
 In one of this weeks TechCabal newsletter, Bankole detailed his woes trying to send money from Nigeria to Kenya. Concluding that besides Western Union, there is no real way to move money between African countries.
 Yet, even though MTOs, Mobile Transfer Operators, like Western Union are cheaper and more convenient than banks, their cost is at an average of 7.35%. This is still higher than the global average of 7.2%.
 Useremit is up against a big and very rewarding challenge. It wont be surprising if WorldRemit, DusuPay and Flutterwave also look inward and give intra-Africa remittances more focus soon.

"MTN Uganda announces $250k startup fund, Open Mobile Money API
","Last night, at an event that took place at The Innovation Village, MTN Uganda announced that developers can now access the API. The company is the first telecom company in Uganda  and MTN Group  to do that.
 The service will be of utmost use to those who are looking to integrate mobile money for different purposes. That includes payments, remittances or enable mobile Money payments off an E-commerce site.
 Services created using the open API can be accessed via Web, App, and USSD channels.
 
 “Our expectations are that this decision will enable innovators to monetise their products, ensure that there is fast turnaround of innovations to get to market and improve the value created for innovators and entrepreneurs, why not a Ugandan Ebay or Amazon in the next few months” Elsa Muzzolini, the General Manager, Mobile Financial Services MTN Uganda.
 
 According to the company, the open APIs are open to both local and international innovators to use. As long as they comply with the terms and conditions of using the API.
 This takes away the lengthy process where developers had to submit paperwork. Instead, developers can now test their product using an online sandbox.
 Currently, the time it takes is unclear because the service is still under the development and testing phase. But, once done, integration to go live via the Open API will take approximately 10 days. This is quite shorter as opposed to over 3-4 months it used to take.
 There has been a tremendous success in countries like Kenya where telecoms opened up their APIs. MTN Uganda hopes to achieve the same.
 In partnership with several hubs in Uganda, the company will facilitate the training of developers on how to use the platform. Elsa, says that the target number of developers is 100.
 Beyond Uganda, the company is also looking to extend the open API initiative to other markets. In the future, we intend to extend the scope of the Open API to other MTN operations, wrote MTN.

 At the same event, MTN also announced the launch of a UGx. 1 billion (approx. US $250,000) Startup Fund to support local technology start-ups in Uganda.
 Before, MTN organized Innovation Awards and app challenges. Yet, none of the two took place this year. The company is perhaps moving away from the above with the introduction of the Startup Fund.
 The fund will allow them the flexibility to get equity in startups as well as support them at the same time.
 MTN noted that it will provide a financial boost to startups that take part in the MTN innovation challenge series. The first of these is the MTN Open API Challenge which starts on December 3, 2018.
 To end the launch, the MTN Uganda CEO unveiled a UGx. 310 million (approx. US $85,000) offering to The Innovation Village. It covers high-speed internet connectivity courtesy of the MTN Foundation.
 
 The package includes free internet connectivity for use by young developers and innovators as part of its youth empowerment drive, MTN Uganda wrote.
 
 But, exactly a year ago, The Innovation Village entered into a partnership with Liquid Telecom. It also involved access to their internet connectivity. Therefore, it is still yet to be understood whether they will be ending that particular arrangement.
 Worth noting also is that this wont be the first partnership between the two. Earlier this year, the MTN Foundation and the tech hub launched tukole.ug  a marketplace for skilled labor.

"Report: Why 90% of Fintech Investment in East Africa goes to American and European founders
","On 20 June 2017, venture capital firm Village Capital released the report “Breaking the Pattern: Getting Digital Financial Services Entrepreneurs to Scale in East Africa and India”. This was carried out with support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation
 The report focused on why the biggest chunk of digital financial services (DFS) startups in both regions are not receiving the investment required to scale.
 For the report, Village Capital interviewed 55 entrepreneurs plus 23 investors, researchers, and other entrepreneur support organizations in India and East Africa. These weighed in on the barriers to scale for financial health innovations.
 One of the key insights from the report was that Investment is highly concentrated in just a few companies. Despite a few well-known DFS companies operating at scale, like Safaricom’s M-Pesa in Kenya and India’s PayTM, most are not receiving the investment they need to scale.
 For instance, in East Africa, startup investment is at an all-time high, but 72% of venture capital went to only three startups in 2015 and 2016. Most fintech startups are not getting the funding they need. Companies like M-Pesa are the exception, not the rule: in East Africa the past two years, 72% of venture capital went to only three startups.
 
 Investors arent investing in the East African region due to a perception of risk in the digital payments space. One of the causes is the fact that it is difficult for DFS companies to access the digital payments infrastructure  Heather
 
 The second key insight was the Human Capital Trap and Business Model Challenges: Investors in East Africa and India consider DFS companies to be risky because of human capital challenges and structural barriers in the marketplace; but these challenges are hard to overcome without investment. As one Indian entrepreneur notes: “The traditional Silicon Valley model of building a product so viral that you dont need a sales force cannot be applied to India.
 Also read: Is Kampala Angel Investors Network the solution to local startups’ funding problem?
 Lastly, the report found a “pattern recognition problem”. This was attributed to the the high cost of early stage due diligence in India and East Africa. Investors often fall back on patterns to find companies and make investment decisions – relying on networks and indicators like prestigious universities or accelerator programs.
 
 If you’ve been paying attention to the Economist or the New York Times, you might think we’re in a golden age for digital financial services in India and East Africa. In fact, we’re only at the very beginning  Ross Baird, CEO of Village Capital.
 We’ll need hundreds of companies to reach scale to truly improve the financial health of communities in India and East Africa, requiring us to look beyond the ‘one size fits all’ model of venture capital in markets that operate under an entirely different set of rules  he added.
 
 When we spoke to Heather Strachan, Manager of Product &amp; Emerging Markets Operations at Village Capital, she revealed to us that the startups that have been able to get these investment in the fintech sector are those that have partnered with other big players or follow specific patterns.
 She also pointed out that the digital payment infrastructure is dominated by Telecom companies like Safaricom and MTN which makes it extremely difficult for one to succeed without them.
 However, to ensure that this pattern is broken, the report provided several recommendations for all stakeholders including. These were explored at length with Heather.
 One of them is that the ecosystems increase the number of local entrepreneurship organizations as well as local investment funds. These can be used to identify and grow local talent as well as build connections with some of the top foreign investors.
 Also Read: African startups are stronger together: What we learned hosting our first cross-continental African program
 The other recommendation was pulling local capital together with foreign capital so that entrepreneurs can more easily access funding and raise full rounds. Lastly, the report recommends that investors should think differently about their investment structures when it comes to the East African region.
 
 Right now, most investors come with the Silicon Valley one size fits all approach which means only equity investment  Heather
 
 Investors should look at what exactly a particular startup needs and they structure their investment around that.
 Asked about the possibility of investors bringing more than just money on the table but also their expertise, she says that is incredibly important to help companies leverage additional expertise, skills, and relationships. It is important that there are also local investors supporting companies to provide some of this expertise and individual support.
 However, for the period of 2015 and 2016, 80% of the investors in East Africa have been foreigners, which highlights the lack of local investors active in the region.

"African e-commerce giant Jumia releases post-IPO results amid securities fraud allegations
","After going public on the New York Stock Exchange last month (April 2019), African e-commerce giant Jumia (JMIA) has released the results of its financial performance for Q1 2019.
 However, this news comes against a murky backdrop of allegations by short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research.
 Despite starting off strong after the bell – Jumia stock grew by 70 percent on a $14.50 per share offering – the company’s stock tripped over accusations of filing false documents with the Securities Exchange Commission in March in the run-up to the IPO. The stock dropped 26 percent in the wake of the report.
 The earnings results, therefore, come at an opportune time to try and remedy the losses being incurred due to what Jumia executives believe are false accusations.
 Q1 earnings
 In the first quarter of 2019, Jumia posted operating losses of $51million up from $38.4 million with $44.3 million in negative earnings before interest, tax and depreciation up from $33.8 million.
 Despite the fact that Jumia is still hemorrhaging money, there are some figures that will prop up the hopes of investors. The e-commerce company’s Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) rose by a significant 58 percent to $270 million. The GMV is the total worth of goods moved over the platform during the quarter.
 Citibank Frontier Markets Analyst Andrew Howell, speaking to TechCrunch, was of the opinion that GMV was not the be all end all but was a starting point to generate revenue.
 “The side that was less encouraging was the expenses are still very high,” he continued.
 In other positive reading for investors, however, Jumia more than doubled its marketplace revenue growth to $17.9 million.
 Fraud allegations
 Activist short seller Andrew Left through his Citron Research published a report on May 9 that claimed that there were discrepancies in some of the paperwork that Jumia filed with the SEC in the run-up to the IPO.
  Andrew Left, Executive Editor Citron Research
 Left’s report claims that there is a difference in the number of active customers and merchants when one compares the contents of an October 2018 Jumia investor presentation and the SEC Form F-1 the company filed in April 2019.
 The difference? 600,000 active customers and 10,000 merchants.
 During the earnings call on Monday, Jumia CEO Sacha Poignonnec refuted the contents of the Citron report, labeling them as market rumors instead of facts.
 He said, “Jumia stands by our prospectus and audited financials and will not be distracted by those who look to create doubt, to profit at our expense and that of our long-term stakeholders.”
 Interestingly, Left does hold short positions in Jumia stock – putting him in prime position for a good payday if the stock continues on its downward trajectory.
 Moving forward
 These accusations complete a rocky first quarter of 2019, coming on the heels of several assertions from the general public that Jumia isn’t truly as African as it claims.
 However, the company – with operations in 14 African states – brushed these off. There are also plans in the works to expand operations to Ethiopia, Angola and DR Congo in the coming years. The company is also toying with the idea of partnering its in-house payment tool JumiaPay with MasterCard in a deal worth around $56 million.
 The JMIA stock also rebounded by close of business on Monday, rising by 5 percent. With the books open now that the company is public, it only remains to be seen how Jumia will cope with the accusations. Mr. Poignonnec said that legal recourse against Citron might not be out of the question.

"Uganda&#8217;s Geoffrey Ssekatawa wins $50,000 for recycling motor oil
","Towards the end of last year, African Entrepreneurship Awards announced the list of winners for itss annual USD $1,000,000. Ugandas Geoffrey Ssekatawa was part of the list, winning $50,000.
 His innovation fell under the Innovation category, Geoffrey together with Moroccos Meryam El Ouafi of Green Engineering Mission and Badr Idrissi of Atlan Space® and Christelle Kwizera of VOMA Groundwater Solar Kiosks from Rwanda. They each won $50,000.
 Geoffreys startup is called Brent Technologies and it recycles motor oil as an alternative to expensive oil using new technology, according to the African Entrepreneurship Awards description. He founded Brent Technologies to stop the harmful dumping and burning of used motor oils, and instead create recycled oil products for sale in Uganda.
 He says, “we recycle waste motor oil, which would end up in landfills, water sources, or burnt into the atmosphere.” And, besides helping the environment, Brent Technologies meets a big need for affordable oils.
 In Uganda, imported lubricating engine oils are expensive. And, when their effectiveness is depleted, they are dumped. Just one litre of oil can contaminate up to a million litres of water. And when dumped on soil, Geoffrey says it “leads to a loss of up to 90% in agricultural yields.”

 Geoffrey is on his way to well-oiled solutions. The entrepreneur developed in-house Surfactant Technology as well as a yet to be patented technology for recycling used motor oil. This technology meets an urgent need in Uganda, where Geoffrey says, “We have only two recycling facilities and their turnover is very low.”
 For his efforts, the Presidential Jury award a $50,000 Innovation prize to the entrepreneur. They stated,
 
 “This entrepreneur demonstrated a passion for the transformation of used products into new products. He invented a technology that transforms used motor oil into reusable oils, thus also reducing pollution by way of used oil spillage into landfills.”
 
 Winning the $50,000 prize, Geoffrey says, will increase his “ability to scale up the amount of waste oil extracted from society thereby increasing our impact on the community.” In the near future, he hopes to take Brent Technologies up to 50,000-100,000 litres a day of production.
 The winners for the $1,000,000 prize also included Allen Kimambo of Zaidi General Enterprises from Tanzania and Folashade Amusa of VicFold Recyclers and Sylvester Mujakperuo of Saint Michelles and Joey Ltd from Nigeria, Adan Mohammed of Ecodudu from Kenya, Kwame Ababio of Green Afro Palms from Ghana. These fell under the Environment and each won $100,000.
 South Africas Louise Williamson of Sustainability Professionals was the only one under the Education category. She too won $100,000.
 Those under the uncharted category were Flavien Simo of Save Our Agriculture from Cameroon and Paul Bartels of WaterBok from South Africa. They each won $100,000.
 The African Entrepreneurship Award, powered by BMCE Bank of Africa is a $1 million award launched in 2015. Last year was the third edition. So far the Award has disbursed USD $2M to 21 businesses across 14 countries in Africa in 2 years. Uganda has had winners in all the years.
 Last year 40 applicants made it to the finals, out which two were Ugandans. The other Ugandan is Arthur Woniala from Khainza Energy Limited.

"Cellulant and Stanbic Bank partner to lend to Kenyan artistes
","
 
 Kenya is among the countries in Africa with the highest number of micro-loan providers. Yet, it seems there is still room for more. Cellulant and Stanbic bank are the latest to join the club. But targeting Kenyan artists, against their royalties from Safaricom.
 In Kenya, artists can opt to earn an extra income by having their songs used as ringback tunes. That is through Safaricoms Skiza scheme. Skiza allows Safaricom subscribers to set a song as the tune that callers listen to. The service comes at a daily fee of Ksh 1 ($0.0098).
 There are 11 million subscribers using the service with over 132,000 songs available for download.
 In August this year, Safaricom reported that they had disbursed Ks 200 million (est. $2,000,000) in Skiza royalties to the over 21,000 artists that are registered.
 But, Safaricom deals with the artists through other companies. Called Content Service Providers (CSPs) or Premium Rate Service Providers (PRSPs), they handle this. Currently, the number stands at 11 and its these that represent artists to Safaricom.
 Out of the fee charged to subscribers, Safaricom pays the artists 30% as the royalty. But, the amount is paid through their respective CSPs or PRSPs. Who, in turn, pay the musicians under the contracts they have signed the artists.
 
 The loan facility will also enable artists to purchase homes, land, construct, purchase cars as well as personal borrowing exclusively from Stanbic Bank. The royalties earned will guarantee the loans through a monthly check-off repayment plan, being managed by Cellulant.
 
 Cellulant is among those 11 CSPs and PRSPs, after launching its ringtone platform in 2004. To date, they count over 5,000 artists signed to it who each earn a monthly royalty.
 Yet, Cellulant says that the royalties these artists are earning arent enough. They have been seeking alternative means to get direct access to capital for their different project initiatives. Hence the move to start issuing loans against those royalties.
 Under the initiative, the 5,000 plus artists will access bank loans from Stanbic. They will be able to secure loans for their various projects. These include recording, video production, event sponsorships, album production, marketing &amp; advertising.
 To qualify, artists should be earning at least Ks 25,000 (est. $250) in monthly royalties. Additionally, they should have a clean Credit Reference Bureau record. There were no details about the amounts of loan amounts and interest rates.
 Founded in 2004, Cellulant is among the companies that have raised a significant amount of funding in 2018.

"AfDB approves $25M Investment in Fund for Renewable Energy Projects
","The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank Group has approved an equity investment of up to US$ 25 million in ARCH Africa Renewable Power Fund (ARPF), a US$ 250 million private equity fund for renewable energy projects across Sub-Saharan Africa.
 ARPF will provide equity for the development and construction of 10 to 15 greenfield renewable energy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, adding approximately 533MW of installed energy generation capacity from renewable sources in the region. This will provide both base load and peak load power in underserved markets.
 ARPF projects will focus on mature technologies including wind, solar PV, small to medium hydro, geothermal and biomass. These would include grid-connected independent power producers (“IPPs”), and decentralized energy projects (commercial &amp; industrial solar, mini-grids and solar home systems companies). The Fund’s strategy is to prioritize projects with a clear timeline to financial close, with emphasis on de-risking early stage greenfield projects.
 Also read: Africa Tech Ventures closes $7.5M from AfDB for seed-stage investments
 The Bank’s presence is expected to act as a catalyst for other investors to commit a further US$ 60-75 million equity from non-DFI sources. The Bank would also ensure that the highest environmental and social standards, together with climate change and gender considerations, are applied to the ARPF’s projects.
 “Energy investments in Africa are constrained by limited well-structured, bankable projects, as well as by unavailability of risk capital. Renewable technologies require additional support to be fully competitive over fossil fuel-based energy generation,” said Amadou Hott, the Bank’s Vice-President for Power, Energy, Climate Change &amp; Green Growth.
 “ARPF will expand the pipeline of bankable energy projects in Africa, and complement and deepen the work of the Bank in this critical area. This is vital for economic growth, and to foster the transition to low carbon across the continent,” Hott added.
 The Project is in line with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy and High-Five priorities, specifically the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which aims to achieve universal access by 2025. ARPF will also assist governments in meeting their renewable energy objectives through on-and off-grid renewable energy technologies.
 In addition to the contribution to renewable energy, the project construction and operation will result in the direct creation of at least 272 full-time jobs and 5,320 part-time jobs.
 The Fund is expected to reach first close in early 2019. The ARPF anchor investing entity is ARCH Emerging Markets Partners Ltd, a London-based emerging-market investment joint venture.

"Alvin Kabwama: His Experience in Silicon Valley and Why Innovating in Health isn&#8217;t for the Get-Rich-Quick
","Entrepreneurship is a journey one embarks on with no understanding of the final outcome. But, just like Mark Cuban says, you only need to be right once. That applies to Alvin Kabwama, a Ugandan innovator who never saw himself ever training at NASA in his lifetime.
 Alvin Kabwama has been innovating since S.5 at St. Marys College Kisubi  when he got introduced to robotics. He has, since then, won several awards and a couple of learning and mentorship opportunities  yet nothing compares to training with NASA.
 A graduate of Makerere University, Alvin is currently training with a group of researchers at Singularity University after emerging winner of the Global Impact Challenge in East Africa. The challenge was launched jointly by Singularity University, the East African Community (EAC) and the ICT Authority of Kenya.
 Seeing that his 8 weeks training opportunity is soon coming to an end, we reached out to find out his experience in Silicon Valley. The conversation ended up talking about the status of Health Innovation in Uganda too.
 Also read: Innovation Village Co-Founder Invited for Forbes Under 30 Summit in Boston, Africa Angel Investors Summit in Cape Town
 How it started
 The idea that landed him the opportunity is UriSAF, which is a maternal sexual reproductive product for mothers in rural areas.
 They are looking at having the kits in clinics because many mothers go for antenatal healthcare and many youths go Urinalysis tests which both require testing urine.
 But you find that the urine samples at these clinics take so long to be tested and consequently, the results are delayed he added.
 One particular incident that he singled out was at Nsambya hospital where they had gone to test their hardware. To their surprise, the laboratory technician had over 100 samples to test that day, yet only a few people got their results that very day.
 
 This implied that the remainder was pushed to the following day. So, they imagined if this scenario of carrying forward was not dealt with, what would be the end result?
 They also found the testing methods flawed. Thats when they decided to double down on developing a kit whereby you can just put in a urine sample and in 2-3 minutes is able to give you the results.
 Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
 It is no doubt Alvin has found Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence the most exciting experiences in Silicon Valley. This can be linked to his previous passion and fantasy about robotics.
 In these two, he has seen an opportunity to better UriSAF which should make carrying out the tests faster and more accurate compared to a human doctor.
 At Singularity University, I have gained knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, he added.
 Before continuing to say, you actually do realize that machine learning, now, does better diagnosis than a human doctor. We are seeing machine learning engines that are doing better radiology tests than a normally trained radiologist who has been trained for 5 years.
 Aside from Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Virtual and Augmented reality are some of the things he is also learning. Of which he says that since he is attached to the department of bio-electrical and computer engineering at Makerere University, he would like to introduce some of them in student learning.
 He thinks this will lift the students interest as they will be moving away from the boring learning through printing handouts.
 
 [With VR and AR] you dont just learn a motor on paper, put on the set and are literally inside the motor. Allowing you to see all that is in the handouts of how the electricity and energy flow  Alvin Kabwama.
 
 Why do Health Products take long?
 I have followed innovators in the health field in Uganda and none of the products have been able to roll out beyond prototype, so far. And since UriSAF is in the same sector, I was curious to find out what Alvin had to say about this.
 He pointed out that people should already know why, for what he thinks are obvious reasons. His tone indicated that several people have asked him the same question before.
 One thing that we need to understand is that health products are not as easy to bring to market as other products. It is not like creating a maize shelling product, he emphasized.
 Before continuing to say that health products are tested for years, even here in the USA.
 He made reference to Becton Dickinson, one of the leading medical equipment companies in the world  and one of the companies sponsoring his training at NASA  whose equipment go for over 10 years of testing.
 Also read: Meet Manuela Pacutho: The Founder of The Cradle and a 2017 Mandela Washington Fellow
 Health products are not something you can just push on the market. It has to go through the different tests, he added.
 Another example he cited is Matibabu  an innovation that can allow one to do tests of malaria using fingers  a team he is part of.  Currently, they are on their sixth prototype which they contracted a Portuguese company to manufacture.
 On top of the long list of the tests, one should also expect approval from the relevant authorities, which takes time.
 
 Health sector requires patience and if youre the person investing for quick money, then it is not your sector. Thats something that we need to understand.  Alvin Kabwama.
 
 What does going to NASA mean?
 For a person who never dreamed of training at NASA, it means something. So, i asked Alvin what it means to him and other people back home who would savor the opportunity.
 I didnt know that through doing entrepreneurship, i would end up at NASA one day. I only used to see NASA on TV but i didnt know that I would end up here, Alvin said.
 He continued to quote Steve Jobs who said: you cant connect the dots looking forward.
 By mere being at NASA, Alvin has been able to cultivate a good number of connections. For example, he is now part of a team that is going to work on air pollution in China in December this year.
 
 My advice is that believe in what youre doing. Sometimes, it is hard. You dont know where it will lead, Alvin advised before citing the scenario when his Visa application was denied.
 For example, the first time I applied for the visa, I failed to get it, he recalled. They didnt give him the visa because, by that time, he hadnt got the invitation letter yet.
 But then i asked myself, should i really apply again? Another $160? Because thats like UGX. 600,000 and you know how much money that is in Uganda. But i told myself let me believe and just apply again, he added.
 What Hurdles are you facing?
 As innovators in a developing country, there are quite a number of challenges when it comes to bringing products to the market. Yet while as we do share some, different people in different sectors and backgrounds face different challenges. For Alvin, the main hurdle yet is peoples attitude.
 We, as Ugandans need to develop an attitude of supporting our own things. For example, people were criticizing the electric vehicle made in Uganda. But it is not much different from the electric vehicles made here [Silicon Valley], he pointed out.
 Before adding that there are more Tesla cars in Silicon Valley more than anywhere in the world. But it is not much different from all-electric cars made from other parts of the world.
 He laments that even if they bring UriSAF to the market and Ugandans dont believe in it, it wont scale.
 Any Observations?
 Seeing that Silicon Valley is the mother of the startup culture that has spread across the globe, i asked Alvin if theres any observations he thinks we can pick.
 He pointed out one in particular; Treating failure as experience and a learning process.
 One observation i have made is that here, everyone i have talked to including  mentors and pitch coaches  knows that the success rate of startups in Silicon Valley is 10%, Alvin informed me.
 This implies that 90% of startups in Silicon Valley fail. But are not looked at as failures. Instead, theyre looked at as experiences. He wound up by urging Ugandans to stop looking at people that create startups and fail as failures.

"Only one Woman selected to participate as a Data Scientist in DataHack4FI in Uganda

 Datahack4FI, a competition aimed at financial inclusion, recently announced the data scientists and fintechs to take part in its program. The i2i organized competition is targeting established Fintechs whom they are pairing with expert data scientists to help them unlock the potential of the Fintechs vast internal data.
 
 
  
 
 
 The selected fintechs in Uganda are True African, NFT Consult, Mambo Pay, Pegasus Technologies, Mcash, Futurelink technologies, AkelloMoney, EzeeMoney, Sula and Moqiud. While the selected data scientists are Peter Erskine, Vitalis Asiku, Edward Kashegu Omara, Kenneth Legesi, Steven Ntambi, Musisi Brian, Nelson Mulera Mugisha, Otim Samuel, Sophie Nanteza and Katto Dickson.
 
 
  
 
 
 Yet, one notable and outstanding fact is that Sophie Nanteza is the only woman in the list of 10 data scientists. While as financial inclusion is an issue that affects both men and women, this publication by The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor argues that Financial inclusion of women and girls can create gender equality by empowering them and giving them greater control over their financial lives.
 
 
  
 
 
 The Global Findex database also points out that as of 2014 Forty-two percent of women and girls worldwide – approximately 1.1 billion– remain outside the formal financial system. Which implies that any efforts geared towards financial inclusion must have a strong consideration of gender equality to ensure they reap most benefits of the efforts.
 
 
  
 
 
 Given that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as the MasterCard Foundation-funded project is running for 5 years, this should be a lesson. They should focus on how best to reach out to more women.
 
 This writing is not suggesting that the problem is with the organizers of the program nor the women who could be participants. It seeks to hold all concerned parties accountable and request them to come together and find out why.

"How Liquid Telecom has been the most active teleco in Africa this year
","Founded in 1997, pan-African telecom, Liquid Telecom, has had one of the busiest years ever. From the onset of 2018, the Mauritius domiciled Group has made a couple of major announcements.
 In this article, we take stock of the companys most outstanding announcements this year.
 We have grouped them into four categories; Partnerships, Acquisitions, Organizations restructuring, and Connectivity.
 Partnerships
 Liquid telecom closed 2017 with two significant partnerships. The telecom partnered with The Innovation Village in Uganda in November as well as Zambia’s Bongo Hive in December. They ended up signing a mega-partnership with AfriLabs  a network of over 120 hubs across Africa  in July.
 In the same month, Telecom Egypt and Liquid Telecom announced a MoU signing to “enable completion of the first fiber network from Cape Town to Cairo.” The Telecom was also named as a Microsoft Gold Partner for cloud productivity.
 Yet, Liquid telecom had earlier entered 2018 by announcing a partnership with Strathmore Business School in Kenya to “drive Africa’s data revolution through new analytics center.” They followed this with a Sudatel partnership, in February, to “launch FTTH in Sudan”.
 In April, they partnered with Serianu to “tighten pan-African cybersecurity”. They also partnered with Impact Hub Kigali to nurture digital innovation in Rwanda”.
 Also read: The IFC is considering a $3M equity investment into Nigeria’s Kobo360
 While, in May, they formed a partnership with China Telecom Global “to step up network collaboration between Africa and Asia”.
 Liquid telecom wrote in the press release: “China Telecom Global has already established a Point-of-Presence (PoP) at Liquid Telecom’s East Africa Data Centre in Nairobi, and will establish further PoPs at its data center facilities in Johannesburg and Cape Town. CTG and Liquid Telecom will also continue to explore joint service opportunities under the partnership.”
 Acquisitions
 Unlike partnerships, Liquid hasn’t been quick to snatch other businesses. But, in mid-October, the company finalized its acquisition of the Zambian Subsidiary, CEC Liquid Telecom.
 “Liquid Telecom has completed the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent stake in its Zambian subsidiary, CEC Liquid Telecom, from Copperbelt Energy Corporation PLC,” they wrote in the press release.
 Liquid Telecom and CEC first entered into the joint venture in 2011.
 Organization restructure
 Ever since the company announced the departure of Kyle Whitehill from Liquid Telecom South Africa in February 2018, they have been on a recruitment craze. The company is restructuring to an org chart that looks like most pan-African banks and telecoms.
 The company then appointed Reshaad Sha as CEO for Liquid Telecom South Africa in April.
 In May, Liquid Telecom appointed Phil Moses as the Group CFO. He replaced Kate Hennessy, who the company said would “continue to serve in an advisory role to the Group CEO and senior finance team.”
 In July, they introduced a new position in the group by appointing Ahmad Mokhles as the Group COO. While Stephane Duproz was appointed to head Africa Data Centres (ADC).
 Recently, in October, Adil Youssefi was promoted from CEO of Liquid Telecom Kenya to Regional CEO of East Africa. And Wellington Makamure from CEO of Liquid Telecom Zimbabwe to Regional CEO of Southern Africa. Both positions are new in the group.
 Yet, it was also reported that the company is also cutting some jobs along the way. At the beginning of October, Liquid Telecom South Africa pointed it out.
 The company announced a new “digitally-enhanced operating model. This includes the automation of many tasks for which people are currently responsible.” Implying that many jobs are likely to be cut once this is rolled out across their different markets.
 Connectivity
 Most of the partnerships that liquid telecom has secured have been around connectivity. The notable one being with Telecom Egypt in July. This enabled the company to complete the first fiber network from Cape Town to Cairo.
 In the same month of July, the telecom installed a 24-meter communications tower at Sauti Kuu Foundation (SKF) in Alego K’Ogelo village, Kenya. This created the “capacity to connect thousands more Siaya residents to high-speed internet.”
 The company also announced the “first Microsoft ExpressRoute within Africa”.
 According to Liquid telecom, this “allows businesses to establish private connections to Azure because, before, customers could only access ExpressRoute via peering locations in Europe.”
 In August, they announced a partnership with Sigfox, to build and deploy a nationwide IoT network covering up to 85% of the Kenyan population. The company said that the “new base stations will be connected to Liquid Telecoms fiber network, to deliver guaranteed reliability and speed.”
 While, in February, they announced the opening of Africa Data Centers in South Africa. They followed this up with opening another data center in Nairobi in April.

"MEST to invest a total of $700k in these 7 African startups
","Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology  MEST  has announced seven startups that will receive $700,000 in total funding according to Forbes. This investment will coincide with its 10th anniversary.
 MESTs 2018 cohort has 7 startups from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Cote d’Ivoire, and Zimbabwe. These have graduated from its year-long training program and each will receive $100,000.
 The seven startups, as described by Aaron Fu, MD of MEST, to Forbes, are:
 
 ShareHouse; kicking off in Kenya, is on a path towards being the Airbnb for warehouses. Their founders are driven by a mission to democratize and bring efficiency to warehouses that have been out of reasonable reach for many SMEs.
 Nvoicia which is launching almost simultaneously in Lagos and Accra will use machine learning to unlock liquidity for SMEs via accessible and consistently assessed invoice discounting.
 Truckr has a founding team obsessed with ground logistics. Theyve spent the last few months in cross-country trucks, parked trucks, with trucking unions, in the ports, and in warehouses. Now armed with these insights are bringing efficiencies to an industry with so much spare capacity in Africa, utilizing robust and affordable software and hardware tailored for the land freight ecosystem in Africa.
 Jumeni from Ghana is starting with waste management as a cornerstone sector but has already seen incredible interest from all forms of businesses requiring remote workforce management.
 Judy in Nigeria is using AI to empower lawyers in Africa. Its just weeks into launch and has already secured a customer in one of the continents largest law firms. But beyond Africa, Im thrilled at how there is strong applicability for their solution through all common law jurisdictions globally.
 CodeIn solves a problem everyone in the tech industry in Africa is keenly aware of: efficiently and consistently testing and hiring software developers, by providing an end-to-end testing and hiring platform, CodeIn hopes to unlock work opportunities for freelance software developers in Africa and the world.
 Bace brings cutting-edge facial recognition technology to bear on the problem of identity and KYC in Africa, beginning with financial institutions that have some of the strictest KYC requirements of any industry, the founding team hopes to scale this and provide identity verification universally on the continent.
 
 Launched in 2008, MEST is among the earliest incubators to have launched across Africa.
 In September last year, they hired Aaron Fu from Nest Africa to take over as its managing director. They followed this with opening other incubators in Cape Town and Lagos. Though they are still headquartered in Accra, Ghana.
 Founded by Jorn Lyseggen, who still serves as the CEO, MEST has made at least 35 investments, 8 of which they have been the lead investor. The 8 are; Kudobuzz, ClaimSync, Asoriba, Dropifi, Mpawa, AdsBrook, Freelancepro.me and Saya. Most of the incubators investments are at the seed stage.
 To date, MEST has also been able to score at least 4 exits. Some of which have been acquisitions among their portfolio companies. For example, Kudobuzz acquired RetailTower, another MEST portfolio startup.

"India &#038; East Africa focused Shortlist closes $2M Series A
","Shortlist, a staffing and recruitment startup focused on India and East Africa, has closed a $2 million Series A round led by Blue Haven Initiative. The round also saw participation from Compass Venture Capital, existing investor Zephyr Acorn, and several others according to Paul Breloff, Shortlists CEO.
 This funding follows Shortlists $1 million University Ventures led Seed round that it raised in September 2017 with participation from Zephyr Management, Spike Ventures, Samir Shah and Bodley Group. It also takes the startups total funding raised todate to at least $3 million.
 According to Paul, this funding will allow us [to] build out our vision for how companies in Africa and India build their teams, Paul wrote. We’re building Shortlist to be a scalable way to collect signals that really matter, like demonstrated skills, interests, aspirations, work style preferences, and motivation — and use them to match the right job seeker with the right company at the right time.

 Founded in 2016 by Matt Schnuck and Paul Breloff, the Mumbai headquartered recruitment startup has more than more than 300 clients and 400,000+ job seekers.
 But we’re just getting started. There’s so much more we want to build to get to know candidates better — their passions, personalities, and potential — and to use that data to find them jobs they love, wrote Paul.
 The startup is betting on filling the gaps that automation of the HR processes is leaving behind. These days, most of the sound bites about HR tech champion artificial intelligence and machine learning as the chief protagonists of the revolution, it points out. Adding that a lot of this innovation is missing something essential, and (nearly) all of it is built for markets other than ours.

"3 Ugandan Bots Among 60 Finalists in Facebook&#8217;s Challenge
","Facebook launched the Bots for Messenger Challenge in February 2017. It covered the Middle East, North and Sub-Saharan Africa. Over 1000 submissions from 64 countries in the above regions were submitted, and from these only 60 managed to make it to the finalists list.
 The announcement was made yesterday through the challenges official site. 30 Bots were selected from the Sub-Saharan region and 30 from the Middle East and North Africa region. Among these, there were 3 Ugandan bots.
 These were Mamas League, Nutshell Bot and Daktari Health. Daktari Health and Mamas League were developed by teams from The Medical Concierge Group which is led by Dr. Davis Musinguzi, who took to Facebook to congratulate his team immediately he learnt of the results.
 Mamas League, according to our interaction with it, is aimed at pregnant mothers. Nutshell, on the other hand, is aimed at giving you all the news taking place in Uganda  in a nutshell. Unfortunately, we didnt get any response from Daktari Health.
 Could this be one of the reasons some of the participants think the entire process was unfair according to the posts and comments in the official Facebook group for the challenge.
 From each region, Middle East and North Africa, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa, the 30 finalist teams will each win a Gear VR and mobile phone, one hour of Facebook mentorship, and up to $40,000 USD in tools and services from FbStart  a Facebook program designed to help early stage mobile startups build and grow their bots.
 All student teams or individual student entrants who made it to the finals will win an additional $2,000 USD. Unfortunately  of the 12 students that made it to the finals  none was from Uganda.
 There will be 6 overall winning teams, 3 from each region, and these will win $20,000 USD and 3 months of Facebook mentorship (1 hour per month). We wish the three teams luck!

"Uganda to host one of the biggest blockchain conferences in Africa
","The Blockchain Association of Uganda is organizing Africa Blockchain Conference slated to take place on May 23 and 24, 2018. According to Kwame Rugunda, the current head of the association, the conference is poised to be “the biggest” of its kind in Africa, to date.
 Themed “the role of blockchain technology in Africa’s transformation”, it is aimed at being one of the first steps towards “positioning Uganda as the leader in the blockchain conversation across Africa,” said Kwame.
 The conference’s website has an ambitious list which includes H.E Yoweri Museveni as the expected guest of honor.
 Additionally, the Governor Bank of Uganda, Prof. Tumusiime-Mutebile, the chairman of the recently formed Kenyan Blockchain Taskforce, Dr. Bitange Ndemo, CEO of BitPesa, Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of Stanbic Bank Uganda, Patrick Mweheire, CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao and the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Llew Claasen, are among the key speakers.
 Asked if all the listed speakers and panelists and speakers will be in attendance, Kwame maintained that “everyone on the list has confirmed his or her attendance.”
 The two-day event will take place at Kampala Serena Hotel with 15 speakers, 30 panelists, 6 break-out sessions, and 700 participants are expected as well as a hackathon. It is organized with support from the Government of Uganda.
 According to Blockchain optimists, the technology is the next big thing after the birth of the internet. Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, has been quoted on several occasions in support of cryptocurrencies, one of the many products of blockchain technology.

 “It may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies,” Fortune Magazine quoted her. Adding that, “Instead, citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies.”
 In Uganda, Laboremus, a software company has positioned itself as one of the few that are embracing the technology, with Timothy Musoke, its CTO, regularly writing about the topic.
 Elsewhere in Africa, Kenyas BitPesa and Zimbabwes Golix have leveraged the technology to branch out in cryptocurrency. While Bitland in Ghana “aims to provide services to allow individuals and organizations to survey land and record deeds onto the Bitshares Blockchain.”
 Apart from this conference, Blockchain Africa conference has taken place before in South Africa. Although organized in Johannesburg, the event had only one person of color. Something many criticized it for.

"What Ugandans Must Know About Building Profitable Businesses
","Building a profitable business in Uganda and anywhere in the world is not easy at all. The road to success is always full of ups and downs. Uganda, according to Charles Ocici – the Executive Director of Enterprise Uganda, tops all the countries with the highest rate of failing businesses.
 Surprisingly, Uganda is among the highly entrepreneurial countries in the world. Worldwide, Uganda rates high in terms of enterprise creation. This is not small. But why do Ugandan fail to build profitable businesses?
 Some business experts say that lack of research on enterprises and market is the major cause of the downfall of Ugandan businesses. No research on niche discovery and products. No research on the target market.
 While many families in Uganda do business and they even boom, they don’t last long because of lack of research. In other words, to build a profitable business, carrying out research before and after starting your business is so crucial.
 However, building a profitable business does not only depend on research. It depends on several other factors. You could be having a well-researched business idea, but if you lack discipline, good personal branding, knowledge, good values and much more, you may still not succeed.
 Success-conscious people have known in life a few things, which actually make them build successful businesses. Through this post, let me share with you great ideas that have enabled a few people to sustain their businesses profitably over a long time.
 One day, I was conversing with a colleague of mine, who has actually made his fortune from a real estate business. He narrated to me how he started his journey to building a profitable business, the obstacles to business success, the lessons he learnt and his future plans.
 I really saw a simple man in body but a great man in mind. It’s not easy to find such visionary people and if you can have two or three of them around you, you can count yourself among the lucky persons.
 This colleague of mine hinted on 5 important ideas that helped him to become a very rich man and I got convinced that the same ideas can be of great importance to others. This is the reason why I chose to share them with you through this article.
 5 Key Ingredients to Building a Profitable Business
 #1 – Success takes time
 Building a profitable business takes time because it takes long to grow a business to the level you want. You have to work hard and determinedly long to make money in business. You have to take action every day, every week, every month and every year.
 Years can pass by before you begin to see some good money coming in from your business. Yes, good money starts coming after building a strong foundation for your business. If you persistently work on your business and remain focused, you begin to see some good results.
 Rome was not built in one day. Similarly, it takes years for one to study before he or she begins to work and to get some income. People, who have gone through formal education, are my witnesses. The same principle applies even to business.
 #2 – Be knowledgeable about your business
 Knowledge is power, so goes the saying. It’s therefore so important to educate yourself about the type of business you want to undertake before starting it. Why? Because it’s very risky to venture into business on which you have limited knowledge. Even after starting it, you have to keep renewing yourself with new knowledge and skills.
 However, a good number of people rush into businesses they have not fully understood. They just hear that a particular business is lucrative and they jump into it. That’s a wrong and disastrous approach to business. You have to do some research to establish the facts.
 Carry out research and read continuously to build your capacity. It helps you to learn new ways of doing business and to anticipate changes in people’s tastes and preferences, desires and needs. Besides, it enables you to keep yourself up-to-date and to achieve your goals.
 #3 – Happy relationships lead to business success.
 This sounds strange, but it’s a reality. Having a stable family and a trusting relationship with people is a key to building a profitable business.
 No man is an island. And some people say that where there is a successful man, there is a woman behind that success. Business success also depends largely on the trusting relationships you have with the people around you and those who do business with you. If you are disorganized at home and in the way you relate with your customers and other people, you cannot build a profitable business.
 #4 – Credibility leads to success in business.
 Be honest and trustworthy in your dealings with your customers. If you cannot pass the test of credibility, then you are just wasting your time and you will never build a profitable business. Trust protects you and it has actually protected most successful business people.
 The colleague of mine mainly deals in real estate whereby he buys land, puts social services in place and sells it. Of course there are many other established property dealers in the marketplace. But because he has built a strong credibility, people feel confident and comfortable doing business with him.
 Do you see what trust can do for you? How trustful are you to your targeted customers? Do they feel you are trustworthy enough? Secondly, do you exhibit it in your actions?
 #5 – Understand that obstacles are part of life.
 As you walk your way to building a profitable business, you will inevitably come across so many challenges, risks, failures and roadblocks. But if you want to succeed in your business, you should never allow those obstacles to derail you from achieving your goals. Remain focused and determined.
 A temporary defeat should never make you pull out of business. When you pull out, it becomes a sure way to failure. How about the time, the energy and the money you have invested in business, aren’t you going to lose them?
 Conclusion
 When my colleague finally went through the above five contributing factors to his business success, he left me contemplating over the future of my business. I reflected on how I could apply the same ideas to grow my small business.
 Eventually, I also realized that I needed to continue rubbing shoulders with successful people like him. It’s good to bring closer such people, who have made their way through. They add a lot of value to your life and their ideas, knowledge and experiences can help you to build a profitable business.

"Global accelerator Antler launches in Nairobi, to invest in 16 startups every year ($100k in each)
","In the past few years, there has been a growing list of global accelerators who also double as micro-VCs interested in either setting up across the African continent or admitting African startups. From Silicon Valley darlings like Y Combinator  which has backed over 30 African startups  and 500 Startups to TechStars.
 Last year, in October, London-based corporate-backed accelerator Founders Factory also launched its African arm called Founders Factory Africa backed by Standard Bank as the first corporate investor. The accelerator has already gone on to back five fintechs from across the continent.
 According to Digest Africa data, there are at least 80 accelerators targeted to the African continent and offer a cash investment in the range of US $5,000 to US $350,000 per startup in the cohort following an average 6-month acceleration program. The investment instruments being used are mostly straight equity and non-equity assistance even if a model incorporating Simplified Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) is beginning to be adopted.
 The latest accelerator to launch in Africa is Antler which describes itself as a “global startup generator and early-stage VC firm”. Antler was founded in 2017 by Magnus Grimeland, the co-founder of Zalora, a Rocket Internet VC backed e-commerce platform.
 The accelerator leverages a matchmaking model where it admits individuals who are then encouraged to identify co-founders with whom to work on a startup idea.
 “We push our founders through a number of tests, team building exercises, team challenges and hackathons to evaluate compatibility and ask the tough questions early on. Through our co-founder pairing framework, we dramatically increase the chances of finding a suitable co-founder with complementary skills,  Antler
 According to the Antler, to date, they have held ‘successful’ programs in Singapore and Stockholm. They are therefore looking to replicate this success by expanding to the African continent. “[Antler] has expanded its operations to include East Africa as well as London, Amsterdam and Sydney,” wrote Antler.
 It started operations in East Africa at the beginning of 2019 with their team distributed between Kenya and Ethiopia. “The Antler team has been working out of Addis Ababa and Nairobi since January 2019”.
 They have already set up the program and will be looking to accept “future founders” for Nairobi by close of August 2019 while the Addis Ababa plan will be effected immediately after they finalize in Nairobi.
 The Kenyan cohort will accommodate at least 40 “future founders” who will then come up with startups that Antler will invest in. “We are looking to invest in a minimum of 16 startups every year in Nairobi, but this could be even higher depending on the quality of the ideas coming out of the programme”.
 The accelerator is also looking to spread its wings across the African continent over time. “Over the next 5 years, aims to expand to additional African countries, such as South Africa, Nigeria and more”.
 Antler takes the “future founders” through two initial phases  each lasting a month  before they are admitted into the accelerator.
 The first phase, over one month, is to sort out those that they think meet their criteria including a clear indicator of what one is great at, grit as well as inner drive. At this level, all the participants receive a stipend of US $1,500 to cater for the basic expenses during the period.
 Once one makes it to the second month, they are then eligible to receive investment provided they successfully go through a final investment committee. “At the end of the second month, Antler invests in companies that pass our investment committee and these proceed to the second phase of the program.”
 Antler invests US $100,000 of which US $85,000 comes in the form of cash while the remainder comes in kind to cover the “5-month program and comprehensive support.” In exchange for the investment, Antler takes a 20% equity stake in the startup.
 This model is similar to that operated by other accelerators including MEST Africa as well as Founders Factory Africa. Each of these makes an investment which comes in a mixture of cash and services in kind.
 However, according to Antler, their model differs from that of existing accelerators. “Antler differs from traditional startup accelerators because it builds companies from the ground up by focusing on ambitious professionals and removing the barriers which normally prevents people from starting their own business,” they wrote.
 In April 2018, it debuted in Asia with a $3 million seed investment which came from a couple of high profile angel investors.
 The funding round included the participation of investors such as John Riady (Director of the Lippo Group in Indonesia), Birger Nergaard (founder of Verdane Capital, which is known to be the first venture capital fund in Scandinavia), and Andreas Ehn (first CTO at Spotify).

"Startup of the Week: Coupon Book  &#8211; a Low Cost Advertising Ugandan Startup
","Theres been a need for low cost advertising that hadn’t been addressed over time and hence grown over due. Coupon Book is here to enable all businesses regardless of their industry to have affordable advertising services at  their disposal.
 With the Ugandan Market being rapidly responsive to products as opposed to services, Coupon Book primarily solves the problem of consumers not benefiting from the advertisement loop. So the coupon book integrates both of them (products and services) seamlessly as a cross vendor platform and yet still a saving tool for consumers on their expenditures.
 The coupon book is a smart marketing tool for vendors providers looking to connect directly with their target clientele. Allowing for brand visibility to grow with their distribution policy as well as their reach.
 Some of the discount coupons fro different vendors in the coupon book.
 The startup offers discounts and promotions, as dictated by the vendors, to end users of the book when they purchase products and services from the business entities that rent space in the book as vendors.
 Such vendors also get the chance to ultimately determine the sales they make by advertising with the platform. With this, the coupon book is being the first of its kind advertising platform in Uganda that gives power to vendors to experience the above explained benefits through keeping track of coupons they receive.
 Also Read: What you Should Know Before Launching and an E-commerce Platform in Uganda
 Currently the startup has over 1800 subscribers with the number expected to increase to at least 2500 by the drop of the 3rd issue in July 2017. The Coupon Book is also planning to release a mobile app that will enable convenience for both vendors and consumers.
  Next year, we anticipate to have a brick &amp; mortar, click &amp; mortar mechanism working in tandem by having the physical coupon book operating in conjunction with the mobile application and website as we give our clientele a triple boost in terms of audience all rapidly scaling to give them a rock solid unmatched brand awareness and sales drive effect  Keith Ashaba, General Manager Coupon Book.
 One of the challenges Coupon Book faces is making masses both the consumption and business world community appreciate and embrace the innovative concept of how the coupon book operates.
 Keith Ashaba says encouraging consumers to buy sold copies of the book makes it hard to convince them that the “spend money and save money” concept actually works.
 The Coupon book is a win-win for both vendors and finals users. The vendors get more traffic or customers while the customers get affordable prices, promotions and discounts. You can register/subscribe here and got yourself a copy.

"The Medical Concierge Group now has a &#8220;Search-for-everything-medical&#8221; option
","The Medical Concierge Group, a Ugandan company that enables 24/7 medical consultancy through call centres has introduced an online search option.
 Launched in 2012, the company has been hailed for its medically related innovations. So far, the company has won Google Africa Connected Award and UCC ICT4D Award in 2014 and Ericsson Excellence Award for Innovation, Microsoft 4Afrika and Deutsche Telekom Innovation Awards in 2013.
 Going by the video posted on Youtube, the company introduced the services either in January this year or late last year. In the video, it says that one can now visit search.tmcg.co.ug to find doctors and other specialists, hospitals in their locations, ambulance services, medical insurance and other.
 The company gives the user a diverse range of options to choose from. For example, the category of Medical Insurance Services which allows one to search for which hospitals and clinics are accepted under your health insurance has over 500 entries.
 I personally find the service for medical insurance relevant given that one-day I travelled from Kisaasi to IAA on Ntinda Complex only to be told that they hadnt started accepting Jubilee Insurance cards. I had to go to AAR.
 Another scenario happened when I went to Ibanda and Iganga districts mid last year. I had to hop from one clinic to another asking for one that accepts Jubilee insurance.
 Yet, I doubt most of the areas may be relevant. For example, despite having over 600 entries, I dont think someone would use the platform to simply search for a pharmacy. Unless it is specifically recommended by a doctor or another person.
 Perhaps, the only way that option might become relevant is when they list some rare drugs that people cant easily find in their neighbouring pharmacies. Otherwise, Uganda  even at Village level is populated with Pharmacies. Though some may not be up-to-standard, they still service the respective communities theyre in.
 Teheca, another health-related startup, offers patient care services. Through their application, one is able to find a healthcare assistant.

"We&#8217;re grossing over $50 Million annually with Ezeemoney &#8211; Kevin Lubega
","2018 has been a wonderful year for Kevin Lubega, the Group General Manager at Ezeemoney. Not only was he named among the Forbes Under 30 for Africa, he was selected among the 200 Obama Emerging Leaders and won himself a scholarship to do an MBA at Stanford Graduate School of Business.
 I had a sit down with him and we explored how he started Ezeemoney and EasyTicket, what he thinks has propelled him to these achievements and what they mean for him as well as his ventures at large. Enjoy.
 Malinz: So Ezeemoney, 2012 right?
 Kevin Lubega: Yes! So we registered in 2012 and started doing the groundwork about July and then officially launched in 2013 January.
 And what did you launch as? As the company you are today?
 It was a very different company then. Initially what we were targeting was to empower the population that did not have mobile phones. It was mobile money at the time and people could send money to each other.
 At the time I believe there was about 30% of the population with phones. So we were thinking, ‘the other 70% how do they get their money?’.
 So we came up with a solution, very similar to Western Union, where you can transfer money between people and they can receive it whether they have a phone or not. But now we are primarily focused on payments and extending financial access through agents.
 Did you begin as one person or a group?
 Right now we are 5 shareholders and we started that way. There are some Ugandans, a Kenyan, a Tanzanian guy and a Malaysian.
 So the five, was it financial pool or different resources brought together?
 A bit of both. For example, the guy from Malaysia owns a company that is providing our system so we outsourced the technology function. Its called mobile money international.
 They were doing this for about 7 years before we started.

 So we thought it does not make sense to reinvent the wheel. We might as well partner with someone who has the existing knowledge who can be able to help us scale. And so we found this guy in Malaysia. He had a great system and the partnership has been great so far.
 The company has also helped us with the expansion. Its not as expensive as this guy knows the part of the business and so we are working together to grow the company.
 How many countries are you in currently? And, what is your market entry strategy?
 We have managed to grow to another 5 countries. The model is that every country we go into, we find a local partner who understands the market, preferably someone whose business involves a distribution network or someone in Mobile money.
 The reason we do that is that these people understand what it takes to build an agent distribution, and also to maintain it.
 We also thought it does not make sense for us to go into a new market and think Ugandans can entirely run the show. We wouldnt have a clue what to do there. And so we try to partner with people who have that local knowledge.
 Did you have any prior experience of running a business before Ezeemoney?
 Yes and No. We started Ezeemoney about a year after I graduated. For the first few months from when I moved back home, I worked with Comtel Integrators Africa doing IT consultancy.

 I had also started a company, again with some of my EasyTicket partners. That failed miserably. So I guess I was gaining experience of what you should not be doing.
 When did you start EasyTicket?
 We started EasyTicket and Ezee money at the same time.
 So is there a coincidence in directors apart from you being on board?
 No. I’m the only common factor in the two companies. The rest are all independent.
 But, do the two companies crisscross anywhere? 
 Not in the past. We are just starting to try and create those synergies. So EasyTicket, for example, we sell tickets online. What we are trying to do now is to use EzeeMoney’s distribution to sell those tickets.
 So far we have done the technical work and piloted the solution. Fully operationalizing the concept is all that is left. EzeeMoney has about 3000 agents across the country. We are trying to see how EasyTicket can leverage that distribution to create more points for our event owners to vend their tickets.
 You had a partnership with Quicket, is it still running?
 Yes, it is. So we got this partnership in 2016. We were looking out for a system at that time and tried to reach out to already existing players on the continent but everyone was quoting a figure of over $100,000, an amount that we didnt have.
 When we had just started, we thought it did not make sense to spend much money on systems—we didn’t have the money to spend anyway. We ended up developing our own internal system.
 Funny enough, we had already contacted Quicket when we had just started as well, but they were also a fairly young company at the time and they were still making their mark on the South African market.
 So in 2016, they emailed my partner John. And I think our old system had run its course and for us to expand we needed something a lot more versatile. The partnership with Quicket made a lot of sense. So they brought in a new online system which is working perfectly.
 But also they helped us now expand into the physical ticketing aspect. Right now we actually print tickets and distribute them. These tickets come with security features like barcodes and holograms and we also have a means to validate all tickets that are sold through our platform.
 I have seen the branding change over time. Now it is more of Quicket than Easy Ticket. Did you get an equity stake in Quicket?
 No. We thought it made sense to have a uniform brand across the continent. So we are working with Quicket to expand that brand on this side of the continent. We are already doing so in places like Rwanda as they are working on expanding into other Southern African markets.
 Also read: Chipper cash wants to do to money what WhatsApp did to texting
 But for us, together, it makes sense to put one brand as opposed to two and yet we are in a partnership. Easyticket now has other business lines, and so we decided to separate the ticketing function (Quicket) with those new businesses.
 And both ventures, what was the range of capital that you guys started off with?
 EasyTicket wasnt that much initially. So we came up with a few thousand dollars in the first few months. I think slightly under $10,000 for the first few months to do the system. We didnt hire anyone. It was just the directors working and we had free space here [at Ezeemoney] to use so we didnt pay rent. But all the time we have kept increasing the capital.
 Ezeemoney started differently so we raised about $3million to start in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. And since then, we intentionally havent raised any more capital.
 Was that external factor or internal?
 Shareholders still. So we havent looked to raise external capital yet. But it is something we are thinking about. We havent made that decision just yet. We think in order to scale faster, it might make sense to raise more capital.
 And in your space as Ezeemoney, who is your direct competitor? Is it the Telecoms or the banks?
 It’s not the telcos or the banks for that matter. We work with both. I think the direct competitor would be someone like PayWay. They are providing a very similar service although we have very distinct offerings.
 Payway, for example, has the Kiosks, that they put in high traffic areas. Thats not our model. We only extend our service through agents. We put people in high traffic residential or commercial areas and 65% of our agents are in urban areas. The telcos and banks are therefore not really our competition.
 Its actually shocking because when we started we had a very big fight with MTN over the same issue. They said we were competing and yet in our mind, we were not. I suppose that feeds into the initial product offering that we were trying to give in money transfer. So you could see how they could interpret that as us trying to directly compete with them.
 But it wasnt in our interest to compete with the telcos. We identified areas where we could have collaborations and we thought that would be a good place to play.
 But has that affected your relationship with MTN since then?
 We dont work directly with MTN. They stopped providing their service in 2014 I think. We havent worked directly with them since.
 But do you foresee any future partnerships between the two?
 We are willing to work together. The case is still in court because they appealed the initial ruling. Once it is dispensed off and the people at MTN are willing to work with us, we are ready.
 Right now, where would you put your team sizes?
 EzeeMoney in Uganda specifically, we are about 45 people but close to about 80 in all the countries. The agents in Uganda are about 3000 and across the region close to 8,000.
 EasyTicket is a much smaller operation and I also took a little step back from EasyTicket as well because of the demands at EzeeMoney. But we directly employ about 4 people as the permanent staff, and then for each event, we have temporary staff who help us run the operations. That team can be as big as 20.
 Are your financials  publicly available or confidential?
 For Ezeemoney yes. We are turning over about $50 million annually.
 Profitable?
 Yes. Slightly profitable but still growing. And it has been very organic growth. So you will get a month on month growth of maybe 7-10%, which is not bad.
 But right now, what is your main focus, is it growth or profitability?
 Its growth. Profitability will come. We are carrying our costs now, so we are finding that we just need to keep increasing our distribution, increasing our service offering and growth in more countries. Then profitability will come.
 When you talk about more countries, do you look to cross to Southern Africa or West Africa?
 Both. We already have Mozambique and Zimbabwe and are looking to do Zambia. West Africa is an appealing market. I am currently engaging someone in Cote dIvoire, so that could be a possibility. Though we havent really found the right partners in countries like Nigeria or Ghana, or North Africa. But we are looking to do that expansion.
 There are very few Ugandan companies that have scaled and done it well. What are the main challenges with scaling?
 Even before scaling, the main challenge I have seen in Uganda affecting many companies is mathematics. People do not do the right calculations. Let me give you an example; if I am pricing a product, I have seen many companies here that will just pick a number and say ‘I will charge ten thousand shillings’. Which is not how it should be.
 Also read: Uganda’s CiplaQCi set for IPO with a valuation of US $12.5 Million
 And so you get to a year or 2 years down the line and realize that ‘you know what, it will cost me twice this amount just to develop this product’. Thats really one of the biggest problems. And you cant scale without having a right pricing model.
 The other one I believe is people or companies seem to be pushing out products that are not scaling. And you cant build a company like that. So many companies struggle to find products that can easily scale or products that are solving huge problems as opposed to individual customer problems.
 In a world of external funding, how can one still achieve organic growth?
 Yes, definitely. Though, right now, I dont think its as sustainable anymore to have just an organic growth when all your competitors are raising ridiculous amounts of money. But also, capital gives you a lot more flexibility to experiment with your innovations.
 When you don’t have a lot of money, you’ll end up being very risk-averse with whatever you are going to do because you want to be sure it will bring you a return. But there are other things you need to do in order to grow your business. You need to experiment with different new products for you to be able to identify what might work and what might not, for example.
 So, I think there is a need for external capital. The problem I see in Uganda and many African countries is companies are not prepared to receive that capital. Many won’t have audited books, some won’t want to give up a lot of equity, other have a board but it is only comprised of the people who are running the company.
 An investor might not be willing to put money in a company where managers are the exact people on the board, auditing yourselves so to speak. I believe having a few independent and highly competent people on your board can go a long way.
 What do you think it took to you to be part of the Forbes list?
 So in the back end, I have been doing too much to try and get to that level of Forbes. It has taken 7 years to get there. So 7 years of failing, iterating and trying to build the business. It has not been overnight for sure. I told you before, I had a failed company. We have been doubling down and continuously experimenting at EasyTicket for the last 6 or so years.
 I have failed sometimes and succeeded others. So it has been quite a journey to get here. I think there have been a lot of sacrifices to do that, both professionally and personally as well.
 What impact do you think Forbes will have on you and your businesses?
 I am yet to predict the long-term impact that Forbes is going to have on my businesses. But, already, I am seeing people getting a lot of interest in my companies. Some are trying to see how we can have collaborations together but it’s still very early days. It has just been about a month. But I am eager to see what we can get [out of this].
 You hinted at the fact that you may be considering external funding as a company. Do you think Forbes might accelerate that?
 I hope so. I have noticed that many companies that have raised funds in the region seem to have a connection to the countries where the funding is coming from. For example, the directors went to school there, or they worked there for a bit, and venture capital is a very network-based industry.
 So it will depend on who you know. But also, its based a lot on credibility. So I hope this publicity will give me the credibility so when I go to raise capital, people will know that I am half serious at least.
 But then you have enrolled for the Stanford Business School. And thats the center for Venture capital. Do you think it will also accelerate that process?
 Well, that is one of the reasons I chose to go there. One because Silicon Valley is a tech hub but also a lot of the Venture Capitalists are based right outside Stanford on Sand Hill Road. So building those networks will be super important.
 And I believe many of them might have reservations about investing in Africa, I think because they dont know much about the region. But also there might be a trust issue. How do I get in there? Who do I speak to?

"Partech Ventures Launches Partech Africa, a $70M Africa focused VC Fund
","Partech Ventures, a European based VC firm has announced the launch of its African arm called Partech Africa. In the official communication, on the funds blog, Partech Africa fund has secured above €57M (US$70M) commitments toward its target size of €100M ($120M). With offices in San Francisco, Paris, Berlin &amp; (now in) Dakar, Partech Ventures calls itself the transatlantic venture capital firm.
 Partech Africa intends to focus on early-stage growth funding, providing €0.5 to €5M initial tickets to talented African teams using tech to address large emerging market opportunities. Partech Africa is a generalist tech fund with target industries ranging from Financial Inclusion (Fintech, InsurTech, new distribution models) to online and mobile consumer services (commerce, entertainment, education, digital services), as well as mobility, supply chain services and digitization of the informal economy, part of the statement reads.
 “Tech VC investment in Africa, with ticket sizes from 200K to $40M, has grown almost 10x from $40M in 2012 to $367M in 2016, and is already growing faster than projected $1B annually by 2020” explains Cyril Collon, General Partner of Partech Africa.
 
 “Most investment rounds so far have been led by the US or EU based investors. The ecosystem is ready for local players, with African teams being able to finance the best African startups”.
 
 The launch of Partech Africa is supported by major financial institutions led by IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and including the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Averroès Finance III (fund of funds managed by Bpifrance and co-sponsored with Proparco).
 Partech Africa is also backed by corporate investors led by major global mobile player Orange and including leading emerging markets players such as Edenred and JCDecaux Holding.
 Africa has witnessed a growth in both Africa-only focused Venture Capital as well as existing venture capital funds elsewhere extending their activities to the continent. According to the website of African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, there are at least 79 Private Equity and Venture Capital funds based in or focused on Africa.
 Last year, CRE Venture Capital, an African venture capital fund founded by Pule Taukobong and Ardon Makumbe led the raising of Andelas $40 Million. This very round had the participation of TLcom Capital  which is also an Africa-focused fund and led by Dr Omobola Johnson, a former Nigerian ICT minister. (See also: Andela Raises $40M in CRE Capital Venture Led Series C Round).
 Partech Africa has Cyril Collon who recently served 4 years as the VP Sales for Europe &amp; Africa at Verscom Solutions and Tidjane Dème, who spent 7+ years in executive roles at Google in Africa as partners.
 Being located in Dakkar, the fund will give an edge to Francophone African ventures that have often been left in isolation.

"The making of Brenda Katwesigye, founder and CEO of Wazi Vision
","The past two years have been great for Brenda Katwesigye. Not only was she named by Quartz Africa among their 30 innovators of 2018, in September, but Forbes’ Contributor Allyson Kapin also named her startup  Wazi Vision  among her “60 women-led startups that are shaking up tech across the globe.”
 But that’s not all. In October, last year, German-based GreenTec Capital Partners announced that they had made an investment into Wazi Vision. The firm shortly stated on its website that the value of the investment was $800,000. But, they have since pulled the amount down.
 Brenda clarified that this was not an actual cash investment. Rather, it was a collaboration agreement where GreenTec would help Wazi Vision with business strategy and also raise money on the startup’s behalf.
 Brenda has also before, participated in a couple of accelerators and fellowship programs. The most notable ones are; Mandela Washington Fellowship, F-Lane, and Westerwelle.
 Looking at the fact that the above came in a very short period of time, one could think that she has had it easy. Yet, Brenda says that everything did not just happen. “It did not come easy,” she says. Adding that it is a “result of compounding of several experiences and failed businesses.” In an interview, she was able to walk me through where she started from and how far she is looking to go.
 The beginning
 Brenda never thought of herself as a businesswoman until when she joined Makerere University. “I seriously got introduced to business while at the university,” she says. Her first attempt at business happened in 2013 and 2014 after she had just finished her university studies.
 “I noticed that people attend graduation but are not allowed to get into the graduation grounds with their phones or any electronics,” Brenda talks of Makerere University graduation ceremonies. “I found it a bit strange,” she adds, “why would someone attend a graduation party without a phone or camera to capture the moment?”
 She thus decided to place shelves at every checkpoint, hired some young people to attend to customers and police officers to keep watch over the electronics. “We charged UGX 1,000 ($0.27) per phone, UGx. 2,000 ($0.53) for cameras, and UGx. 3,000 ($0.8)for laptops,” she says.
 This, however, never came to last as it proved to be a short stint, after realizing that it would never be profitable. That was partly because they had to pay a lot of people in the value chain; from the police to the members of the students guild, everyone wanted a share of it.
 They were also plagued by other challenges. “My brother was arrested just because he had not given the policemen the money they wanted,” she says. They thus decided to call it quits. Nonetheless, she maintains that it is “when I made my first [UGx] million.”
 The next step
 Although Brenda’s first business efforts were frustrating, she already had a cushion. Besides pursuing the ‘side hustle’, she had a day job at Deloitte in Uganda. At the same time, she decided to start another venture, to move past her frustration.
 After looking around, she remembered something they had worked on before while at the university. “After University, we had done this project of using tech to bring health care closer to people,” Brenda says, “I figured I could actually push it as a project outside the university.”
 This came to be known later by many as m-Tambula/InstaHealth in 2013. Yet, InstaHealth  too- did not live long. The startup shut down completely at the beginning of 2016 due to a multitude of things that went wrong. “We did not want to close it, but we had to,” Brenda pointed.
 Also read: 6 lessons a founder learned from the Alibaba eFounders Fellowship
 She blames the failure to naivety as well as having no prior experience running a business. “I was a bit clueless,” she says, “I understood the basics of costs, revenue and profit but I did not understand what it took to get people to pay for such a product.”
 Not only did it take them so long to figure out the R&amp;D, but the business model also wasn’t clear as well. “Of course, we had raised some money from a few grants and prizes but it was not enough to meet some of those costs,” she says.
 Yet, from InstaHealth’s failure, she points out a key lesson learned. Since then, Brenda has made ‘keep it simple’ her mantra when approaching innovation. “Everything has to be simple,” Brenda cautions.
 “A layman should be able to get it well enough to be able to understand its value and pay for it. When you talk about your product, do people easily understand? When you talk about mobile money, even my grandmother knows I need to get a message that has money.”
 Enter Wazi Vision
 Using her conventional way of doing business, Brenda looked around for something she could take advantage of. “Again, I saw an opportunity to give people an alternative to expensive eyewear and eyecare generally,” she said.
 So, as InstaHealth was shutting down at the beginning of 2016, she was already thinking of a potential replacement. That later came to be known as Wazi Vision. “They almost overlapped,” she talks of InstaHealth and Wazi Vision.
 But this time around, the new idea was to come “with a better business model.” She also “worked on branding it better, being more clear on what exactly I was trying to sell and also make better use of opportunities to grow.”
 She also wasn’t able to face financial challenges as was the case with InstaHealth. “I started out with my own cash for R&amp;D,” she says, “but I got a USADF grant, thats not a secret.” The grant amount totaled to at least $75,000 which she received towards the end of 2016.
 Though she also held her job at Deloitte until January 2017 before quitting to focus on Wazi Vision 100%.
 Even though Brenda walked into Wazi Vision more enlightened, still, a couple of challenges were awaiting her. “Nothing is ever too straightforward with no challenges. We are still very far from what we want to achieve but the desire for growth drives me.”
 A lot of changes have happened since she started, like where the production is happening. Before, production of the glasses took place in Uganda, however, Brenda says that it was very expensive to make the end product affordable for their target market.
 “We couldnt also maintain the consistent quality and it was very frustrating in a way,” she added. “But you also know the manufacturing scene [in Uganda] as regards to new products and R&amp;D, and expectations in the market.”
 So they had to start outsourcing the production. “We are moving the production to Switzerland,” she hinted, declined to reveal the company’s name. Though pointed out that the “company is a luxury brand manufacturer which is looking to do goods in Africa.”
 They have already rolled off a few pairs of glasses from their partnership with the Swiss company and Brenda says that “they do not break.” “For me, I think that is a value add because I have seen people who wear glasses and their hustle,” said Brenda.
 Social Impact
 Wazi Vision started out on the back of social impact which involved recycling plastics to make glasses. Moving the production away from Uganda, thus, significantly reduces the amount of social impact the startup boasted on the outset.
 Though Brenda disagrees. “The social aspect is there [but] the story is a bit different now,” she says. Maintaining that recycling plastic for the production of the frames wasn’t the only social aspect of Wazi Vision.
 “When it comes down to certain things, they are designed in Uganda by Ugandans. The glasses are designed here, though not manufactured. So the design stays here.”
 She also adds that they are serving people who otherwise could not afford the glasses. “We are tapping into a market that is not you and me,” she said, “people who can afford to pay, but cant afford to pay too much.”

"Tugende Secures $5M To Expand Financial Inclusion In Uganda
","Founded in 2012, Tugende is a Uganda-based for-profit social enterprise dedicated to putting people in control of their economic future. An asset-finance specialist, Tugende provides finance and support to help self-employed entrepreneurs own income generating assets.
 Tugende’s primary product is a lease to own package for motorcycle taxi drivers, helping them own rather than rent their essential equipment, as well as providing training, life, medical, and vehicle insurance, and safety equipment.
 The company serves over 10,000 active customers across 9 locations in Uganda, with 7,000 additional leases already fully repaid and ownership transferred. Tugende is expanding quickly within Uganda and preparing for further growth regionally and into other income generating asset products. In an August 2018 interview with Digest Africa, Michael Wilkerson, Tugendes co-founder and CEO, pointed out their desire to move into leasing cars.
 However, at the same time, the company is also looking at closing in on unemployment as well as expand financial inclusion in Uganda following their recent fundraise.
 On February 4, 2019, global impact investment firm, PG Impact Investments announced that it had made a $5m debt investment into Tugende. PG Impact Investments has become a lender to Tugende, a Kampala-based provider of lease-to-own financing to financially excluded individuals to help them own income-generating assets, read part of the release.
 Last year, Michael told Digest Africa that they couldnt meet their current demand for motorcycles. “We are getting 100-200 new applications a week,” he said then. This particular investment, therefore, will go towards ensuring that Tugende meets that demand for its primary assets (boda-bodas).
 Lack of transportation has been highlighted by the United Nations as one of Uganda’s most significant obstacles for economic development, while high unemployment and exclusion from financial services compounds a lack of opportunity for the majority of low-income individuals.
 Also read: How Michael Wilkerson turned a side hustle into Tugende
 Tugende works to provide financial stability and to increase access to wealth through their unique financial products in the transportation sector, including insurance, safety equipment and training, as part of its financing packages.
 The companys clients are considered too risky to lend to by most banks, but with 7’000 leases completed, the company has found that customers on average double their daily net income as a result of owning through Tugende. This ownership allows customers to invest their own higher earnings to buy land, property, livestock, healthcare and education, which Michael says is key to creating economic growth.
 “There are millions of self-employed entrepreneurs in East Africa who will make and save more money with the right access to finance, particularly for productive assets,” Wilkerson says. “The impact created when these new owners invest those gains back into their own communities is transformative, and Tugende is dedicated to continuing to help people drive themselves up the economic ladder.”
 Tugende has been looking for growth capital of at least $10 million throughout the past 24-plus months. On July 31, 2018, they announced that they secured $5 million in debt from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Between 2014 and 2015, Tugende also raised $780,000 in funding, the majority of our fundraising in that round was debt.
 In the interview with Digest Africa, Michael pointed out that he prefered debt financing compared to other funding types. There were two things that were different for us than for a lot of early-stage companies,” Michael told Digest Africa then, first, Tugende was raising both straight debt (loans), and convertible debt which could turn into equity at a later stage.
 The main reason for preferring debt is his desire to control the destiny of his company. [We] are very cautious about keeping control of our direction, Michael said. “We want to make sure that we control the strategic direction so that we don’t get pushed into something that is profit maximising at the expense of our customers.”

"E.A Incubators Should Push Young Entrepreneurs to Talk to &#8220;Real People&#8221; &#8211; GrowthAfrica CEO
","Last week, GrowthAfrica held its first GrowthAfrica’s Acceleration Programme 2017 workshop in form of a boot camp for its Ugandan cohort at the Innovation Village in Ntinda. The boot camp was the first of seven workshops that the 11 businesses in the cohort will be subjected to.
 It is a very intensive program, just like one would expect an accelerator program to be. The trainers pump so much in those five days they get to interact with the businesses.
 These three days a workshop will go on until December 2017 with occasional follow-ups on the participating businesses by GrowthAfrica staff, who are called Growth Catalysts and Financial Modellers who work with the businesses to essentially get them ready for investment.
 When I paid a visit to one of their training sessions, I found Dr. Edward Isingoma, Managing Director at Pearl Capital Partners taking them through a session on investment readiness.
 Johnni and Dr. Edward Isingoma, Managing Director at Pearl Capital Partners
 In between, I was able to get a quick chat with Johnni Kjelsgaard, the Founder, and CEO of GrowthAfrica. Johnni speaks so proudly about this cohort as well as his commitment to see that they get equipped with whatever is necessary to enable them funded.
 This is the second time GrowthAfrica is running the programme in Uganda. Prior to shifting to the innovation village, the programme workshops were been held at the Bugolobi based Venture Labs.
 For this cohort, there are 11 businesses. These include IntelWorld, GRS Commodities, Global ICT, Smart Watch Solutions, Patasente, Gorilla, Lipa Mobile, Bee House, Bold in Africa, Ugabus and Eco International. They span Agribusiness, IT, renewable energy and other sectors.
 Asked the first thing they do with their cohorts, Johnni says they “investigate if their [business owner’s] assumption about their business is correct and that primarily has to do with their customers”.
 Edward receiving a gift from the GrowthAfrica team
 The team at GrowthAfrica tries to establish if the customers see the products and services of these businesses the way the business owners think they do. This is aimed at removing any chances of one of the business founders living in a bubble.
 Often, according to Johnni;
 What is common with not only entrepreneurs generally but also the cohort that we have here, is that because youre so busy developing your products and trying to sell, you never really feel you have time to take two steps back and ask if what you assume about your customers is real.
 Yet, that’s just one of the many things the team at GrowthAfrica investigates. The other thing is what they do about figuring out what my customers think about their products. They find out how they take that input and put it into a process that informs them about refining their products and services.
 Focus
 Johnni emphasized that their focus is not too much on startups. They usually take on post- revenue businesses- ventures that have been existence for a couple of years, already have a product or service that is in the market and existing customers.
 Businesses mostly admitted into GrowthAfrica’s Acceleration Programme, are those that are still trying to figure out how to scale, start or keep growing as well as those looking to accelerate their growth. But, amongst of all key things considered, these businesses should be creating enough value for the customers to justify charging whatever they are charging for their products and services.
 Similarities
 Although all the startups accepted in the cohort are not in the same industries, Johnni says that “most of the businesses accepted have a few things they share in common.”
 For the current cohort of 11, “the thing they have in common is the stage theyre at”, says Johnni. Which, as highlighted in the focus section, is that they are just about to figure out how to grow exponentially as businesses. Johnni believes all businesses accepted have the capacity to significantly grow and reach full scale.
 Cohort Participants taking a Selfie with Johnni
 “Another thing that they have in common is their willingness to ask for help”, Johnni adds. This is one of the things GrowthAfrica screens for. He says “there is a lot of entrepreneurs who often say they are not open to input.” The kind that believes they have everything in check and all they need is funding.
 The kind that believes they have everything in check and all they need is funding. Johnni says that’s not a group they’re interested in. On the contrary, they look for those that “have the humility to say they actually need some guidance”.
 Scale
 Given that GrowthAfrica’s focus isn’t startups, I engaged Johnni in clarifying the nature the of business and what level of scale they focus on. Not surprisingly, they prefer pre-scale businesses.
 They also look for businesses that have the ambition of growing internationally. Though, as Johnni emphasized, they are “not necessarily talking about ‘unicorns’.”
 But, it has to be growth outside of Uganda, East Africa and perhaps it can be global. Most importantly, they are after businesses with the potential of becoming medium sized companies that can, in turn, employ hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
 Success stories
 Along the way, GrowthAfrica has been at the center of some of the successful companies in East Africa which gone through their accelerator program and eventually raised funding. Some, are looking to expand across the continent. These
 Though the website indicates a figure of US $46 Million, Johnni says GrowthAfrica has now helped business raise funding that has surpassed that figure. He estimates the current figure in the region of US $53-57 Million.
 Participants in a session
 One of the businesses he is most proud of is M-Kopa solar. It is one of the companies that they have assisted. M-Kopa spent the first few years of their existence at GrowthAfrica. They were in effect incubated at the GrowthAfrica facility.
 Unfortunately, for Johnni and GrowthAfrica, that was before they started taking a small percentage of each business that used their facility. M-Kopa indeed is a success story given that their last raise was over
 M-Kopa indeed is a success story given that their last raise was over US $20 Million at a valuation of over US $200 Million. Plus, they were named alongside Jumia among the 50 Smartest Companies of 2017.

 That, according to Johnni, so far is their biggest success. However, he also highlights other businesses like Soko that raised over US $2.5 Million in their last round. This he follows up with EcoFuels, an agro-processing company that also raised around
 This he follows up with EcoFuels, an agro-processing company that also raised around US $1.5 Million for their last round.
 Altogether, he puts the total estimate of those that have raised above US $1 Million at around 5 companies. Though they have also had over 18 companies raise somewhere between 300,000  800,000 USD.
 Partnership with incubators
 Given that GrowthAfrica focuses on pre-scale businesses, I  was interested in finding out if they have any form of partnership with hubs or incubators across East Africa to create some sort of conveyor belt that can continuously supply them with businesses. They don’t.
 This he attributes to the fact that most of the entrepreneurs in these incubators are still young. Johnni clarifies that “not that we havent partnered with the incubators, but we have not seen much come through from the incubators at least in Kenya where we have been the longest.”
 Though they have had a couple of businesses come through from ChandariaBusiness Incubation Centre as well as a couple apply from Nailab. Though these never made it through.

 He says that incubators seem to mainly attract students who are very young entrepreneurs. Yet, GrowthAfrica’s ideal entrepreneurs should be in their 30s. This he says is not aimed at age discrimination but that’s the age that usually has what they’re looking for.
 He says that what seems to work well for them are entrepreneurs that have had some work or industrial experience as well as those that understand the sector or industry that theyre in. yet most of the entrepreneurs in the incubators lack these.
 
 Most of our entrepreneurs are early to mid-thirties. We have even had entrepreneurs who are in their late 50s. So the age span for our entrepreneurs is from late 20s upwards  Johnni.
 
 Young Entrepreneurs
 Incubators should burst the bubbles of these entrepreneurs who are seated in their incubation spaces and force them to go out and talk to real people, says Johnni, GrowthAfrica CEO. This was when i asked him about what incubators should do to ensure they can put out entrepreneurs that meet their criteria.
 They, according to Johnni, need to “tell them how they engage with customers, how they engage with potential users as well as how to engage with other partners and stakeholders.”
 Johnni says that at GrowthAfrica, they have constantly asked themselves “how to do we crack the nut that is startups”.
 Also read: Andela Uganda Opens Application for Third Cohort
 And in their experience, from running a couple of cohorts with entrepreneurs who are pre-revenue, theyve seen that these entrepreneurs dont listen. This, he repeats, is partly because they think they know everything.
 “And they think they know everything because they have not been in the market”, he adds, and continues, “they have not been out there and receive some ‘beatings’ from customers, suppliers and other entrepreneurs.”
 He believes that if incubators in East Africa can burst the bubble in which these young entrepreneurs are, “all of a sudden youll have entrepreneurs who are more mature”.
 This is because theyll be forced to see things from other peoples perspective which will teach them a valuable lesson in terms of who their customers are and how valuable their product is.
 Previous cohorts
 I was very anxious to get feedback on the previous Ugandan cohort which included RoundBob, Clinic Master, Amagara and many others. But, Johnni revealed to me that their program actually runs for around 42 months – not just six. The first six months are just a preamble to the real support.
 Also read: This Ugandan Youth is Slowly Building A Film Company With Friends
 So, he says, you can’t expect that much from these companies until that time is done. Though Clinic Master has raised some undisclosed funding but mostly debt.
 Johnni also adds that they have realized that things take time in Africa. This is especially in economies that are not as mature as Kenya. Like Ethiopia, Uganda, and Zambia – where they cover. Theres a little bit of Kenyan bias in Johnni’s opinion.

"Endiro Expands to the US, Temporarily Closes in Iganga
","A week ago, we broke the news of Endiro Coffee expanding to the US. A week later, we have learnt that they are planning to close their shop in Iganga  temporarily.
 Endiro is set to launch its first guest house soon in Iganga and is in the process of finishing the property.  They are looking to have their visitors enjoy life out of the hustle of the city in a retreat style environment. They believe this will give them opportunities to learn from local farmers and artisans.
 The coffee shop in Iganga will temporarily close so that they can re-build it in an improved location nearer to the guest house. They are optimistic that building a new location from the ground up will create jobs for local workers as well as improve amenities for their customers. The Endiro shop located on Iganga main street will close by the end of this month.

 GOOD NEWS: Endiro Coffee to open its first USA branch in downtown Aurora, Illinois, in just a few weeks time. Pic Credit: DT Auroran pic.twitter.com/L5u6C3KnpI
 &mdash; StartupDigestAfrica (@DigestAfrica) March 21, 2017
 
 On March 6, 2017  in a press release which we received by email  Endiro Coffee, through Cody Lorance  the Director of US Expansions  announced itll be opening up its first branch outside Uganda. This branch is soon to be launched in downtown Aurora, Illinois.
 
 In a few short weeks, the Endiro story will start yet another chapter as the company opens its first location in the United States.  Just outside of the American city of Chicago lies Aurora, Illinois. There on the banks of the Fox River, Endiro is getting ready to launch a coffee shop in the heart of the city’s historic downtown district.
 Aurorans, Chicagoans and even diaspora Ugandans will soon be treated to single-origin Ugandan coffee from the village of Bukalasi in Bududa, specialty grade Ugandan tea from Mityana, and even some Ugandan street food favorites such as rolex, samosas, and muchomo.
 In true Endiro fashion, a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu will compliment a coffee, tea and juice menu that will be difficult to beat.  Endiro’s Corporate Executive Chef explained:
 “We call our culinary style, ‘Glocal Food’ because we like to take popular dishes from around the world and put our own, distinctly Ugandan twist on it. Aurorans are going to love it!” 
 Today, Endiro has established itself as one of the most popular coffee brands in Uganda and has seen its operations expand from the coffee cup all the way to the coffee tree.
 Currently, some 2,000 coffee farmers – most of whom are women – are members of the Endiro Growers network and 100% of Endiro’s Ugandan coffee comes from these farmers who receive training, equipment, mentoring and the nation’s highest prices per kilogram of coffee through the partnership.
 In 2015, Endiro opened its 4th and 5th locations amid growing popularity and launched its first coffee growing project. The Auroran coffee shop will be its 6th after the shops in Kisementi, Mbale (2), Iganga and Naguru.

"Uganda&#8217;s Wazi Vision secures investment from GreenTec Capital
","GreenTec Capital Partners today announced that it has made an investment into Uganda-based Wazi Vision. In the official communication, GreenTec Capital will support Wazi Vision through its “results4equity” investment approach providing business development, technological support, and funding.
 Founded in 2016 by Brenda Katwesigye in 2016, Wazi Vision was recently selected by the German Ministry for Economy and Energy (BMWi). The startup qualified as an example of the dynamism and innovation of African startups.
 This got Brenda Katwesigye invited to Berlin recently, together with other African women, where she attended Startup Night Africa.
 Wazi Vision, developed an innovative mobile app and manufacturing process to expand access to affordable eye-care in East Africa.
 It leverages technology and mobile eye-care testing camps bringing affordable vision assessments and eye-care to poor and rurally living people. The startup provides screenings for $1 and glasses from between $8-20.
 Currently, the app provides basic vision tests and eye screening, relieving the burden of travel to urban specialists and the high-cost of optometry services.
 Using recycled materials, the company provides a range of hand-crafted eye-glasses designed to high-quality, stylish, and durable.

 The startup has been very active in the last year, receiving awards from the Land of African Business and being accepted into Vodaphone’s F  Lane accelerator program.
 “We are very impressed with the team’s innovative approach to expanding eye-care access in Africa and their achievements in a short period of time. We expect great things from Wazi Vision” says GreenTec CEO Erick Yong.
 With this investment, Wazi Vision joins Safarini Translator and Divine Masters Limited as Ugandan startups invested in by GreenTec Capital. GreenTec invested USD 100,000 and $5,000,000 in both startups respectively.
 Focused mainly on Africa, GreenTec has also made investments in startups from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Rwanda.
 UPDATE
 An earlier version of this article stated that Wazi Vision received $800,000 from GreenTec Capital Partners. We based this figure on an amount that GreenTec stated on their website. However, they have since pulled it down. Brenda also reached out and informed us that the investment isnt in cash and has a lot of non-monetary aspects.

"Here&#8217;s why we are retracting the mPharma article
","Hello everyone, I am writing to inform you that we are retracting the article titled Ghana’s mPharma secures $9.7M of the $12M it sought for its Series B that we published on January 15, 2019. The basis for the retraction is that there are some elements of it that are not true according to Gregory Rockson, mPharma Co-founder and CEO.
 We have, therefore, put it down (for now) and will only put it back up after mPharma has clarified on the deal or issued a public statement about it.
 One of the things that we pride in at Digest Africa is speed and accuracy. Yet, the latter wasnt given a critical consideration in the publication of the article, something that I  in particular  and the Digest Africa team regret tremendously.
 Our overall vision is to organize all the data and information about Africas technology ecosystem and disseminate it in ways that are easy to understand and consume. In the process of doing that, we are trying to as much as possible automate the processes.
 One of the things we are automating is the fact-checking of data in real-time  without having to require human intervention  as well as writing articles that are repetitive in nature like raising funding. This, in the end, will make it faster and cost-efficient to report on such topics. Yet, our technology is in the early-stages hence prone to running away with articles or flagging data accurate that should instead be flagged red for further human intervention.
 Nonetheless, this is something we should have considered seeking clarification from the mPharma team.
 We therefore deeply apologize to the mPharma team  especially Gregory who I have in the past interacted with on a story about mPharma  as well as publications like Techpoint, Ventureburn and others that trusted us and quoted the publication.
 This is a significant lesson for Digest Africa as the publication and me as the leader of the team and we shall use it to further tighten our processes of fact-checking the accuracy of the data and information that we publish.
 Going forward, we have resolved to contact the companies involved in the deals beyond $1 million especially those that are discovered through our automated processes from public archives like SEC for those incorporated in the USA and Companies House for those incorporated in the UK.

"What Ugandan Startups Should Know Before Scaling
","There’s no standard definition for scaling. However, some people have given their opinions on what they think is close enough to define what scaling is. One of these is Fred Distin, a former partner at Accel Partners London.
 In his answer to the question, on Quora, “What is involved in a startup “scaling”?” he defines scaling as the period in a startup’s life when management and board feels like they can systematically accelerate growth with  confidence that the resources they put in will yield great and measurable results.
 However, with the exception of the likes of Jumia, anyone who follows the startup scene will note that very few bred in Africa have been able to scale beyond the borders of their country.
 Yet with the increase of funding to startups in Africa, we suspect that whoever is investing in these startups will eventually target the continent as a whole – not just a country where the startup has been founded.
 In a bid to equip startups that might look at going this way, we spoke to Kenneth Ntende. He’s a co-founder at DusuPay which is currently operating in 8 countries including Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania and the UK.
 
 We have learnt quite a lot along the way during our expansion life cycle – Kenneth Ntende, Co-founder DusuPay
 
 
 Here are some of the cautions Kenneth has for any startup that’s looking to expand beyond its country or region.
 1. Do a proper analysis of the market you want to expand to.
 Africa is a continent with more differences than similarities. Different markets have different languages, ethics, religions and so much more. An advert that may work perfectly in one region or country can turn out to be a disaster in another.
 Kenneth recommends that you take time to really understand these varying distinctions. In the end, it gives you an added edge when approaching clients and potential partners.
 2. Understanding the payments landscape is key.
 You need to know how you will get the money from your clients in the country you want to expand to. In Africa for example cards account for only 1% market share of all payments so it is relevant you get a partner that enables you tap into the multiple local alternative modes of payment like Mpesa in Kenya, online banking etc.
 Kenneth goes on to emphasize that this is one of the reasons they came up with DusuPay – to ensure one can access all payment modes in one place.
  3. Get local partners 
 It is very hard to penetrate a foreign market. However, Kenneth suggests something that will enable you to get around any hurdles that may be presented by this. He recommends that you get in touch with a local trusted partners wherever you expand to give you an added advantage.
 
 Take an example of a startup that is into e-commerce expanding to another country. You may need to get a new logistics partner for each country you expand to. This is because chances are your partner in one country doesn’t operate in another, hence the need for local partners.
 4. Listen to the numbers
 Scaling – once rightly done – can turn a startup into a market dominant. Yet, if wrongly executed can result into its death. Analysis of data in the new markets is key.
 Kenneth recommends the use of tools like mixpanel to help get a better understanding of how you are fairing. As long as you’re willing to be brutally honest with data, it will help you know whether you should proceed with the scaling or not.
 When your startup thinks of scaling, you should consider talking to those that have been able to successfully do it. This will help you avoid making mistakes that have already been made by others.

"Egypt&#8217;s street food vendor Zooba Eats raises $4M for US expansion
","Zooba Eats, an Egyptian street food restaurant chain, recently raised a $4 million Series A from an undisclosed group of investors. Although the deal was announced on January 14, 2018, according to their SEC filings, it was concluded last year and the filing made on December 27, 2018.
 Now, with the cash in the bag, the company says that it has set its eyes on expanding to New York.  [The funding] will be used to open a flagship outlet in Manhattan’s Nolita neighbourhood by next summer and then scale out the Zooba brand in the city, with a long-term aim of spreading across the US like bessara on baladi bread, wrote Zooba in the press release.
 We could not be more thrilled to share the news that we are set to become the first ever restaurant concept 100% homegrown in Egypt to launch in the US (we think), the company added.

 Though, this is not only opening a branch in New York but shifting the companys headquarters too  and highly likely their market focus. This is because Zoobas founder and CEO Chris Khalifa and key senior team members will be relocating to NYC. Instead, former Zooba Marketing Manager Ahmed Fahmy taking over as Egypt Country Manager.
 According to Enterprise.press, Zooba is also expanding to other parts of the world with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain on top of the radar. Khalifa told the blog that they recently signed their first franchise agreement. He also added that he expects the company’s first location to open in Riyadh before this summer. 
 The run caps a busy fall-winter season for the restaurant company, which launched a new menu in October and opened a branch in Sheikh Zayed in November that gives it six locations in the Greater Cairo Area.
 According to Eater New York, Zooba offers classics, as well as twists, on Egyptian street food. The menu centres on dishes like ta’ameya, the local variant of falafel made with fava beans instead of chickpeas, resulting in a fluffier texture. Besides a classic flavour, Zooba offers a spicy pepper ta’ameya, an eggplant ta’ameya, and a pickled lemon ta’ameya.
 Founded on March 31, 2012, by Chris Khalifa and head chef Moustafa El Refaey, this is the only publicly known funding round raised by the street food vendor since inception.

 However, the story doesnt end there. Fezah is intensifying its efforts in events by either organizing its own or finding event organizers to partner with.
 Fezah runs or partners with great events (we call them stages), Elijah told. Adding that they are currently involved in 7 events.
 Tomorrow, Fezah is organizing its Fezah Saturday Unplugged event at Design Hub Kampala in the industrial area with local Ugandan artist, Naava Grey, set to be the performer. Naava wont be the first to perform on the stage. In June, Sauti Ya Africa graced the same stage.
 In addition to the Saturday event, Fezah App has 6 more events that they organize or participate in as partners according to Elijah.

"Godel wants to fix Uganda&#8217;s broken last mile delivery system
","When Jack Ma pointed out the areas that still presented opportunities in Africa, logistics was among them. This is because of the broken logistics system across the African continent.
 In the end, not only does it drive up the cost of e-commerce, it makes it impossible sometimes. Godel, a logistics startup based in Uganda, wants to fix this. Starting with the last mile.
 However much e-commerce has been on an upward trend in Uganda, last mile deliveries are still a huge challenge. A problem faced by both emerging and already established companies.
 For example, Transtel is a Ugandan authorized distributor of Samsung, Beko and Skyworth products. Yet, they couldn’t find an efficient way to fulfill their logistics needs. Hence, the creation of an internal logistics arm.
 “We [Transtel] have to distribute products,” Anuj Thakrar, Godel’s Managing Director said. “We [thus] need an organized logistics network.”
 He added; “Thats why we launched into Godel because within our existing companies, we already have a logistics need.” Godel was, thus, born out of necessity.
 Early this year, it spun out as an independent startup. With the aim of fixing the last mile delivery problem not only for Transtel but other businesses.
 Currently, they serve clients ranging from Jumia, Prudential, Orient Bank and more. “I would say we work with over 20 large customers that we are servicing,” Anuj pointed out.
 The startup operates two models.
 They can deliver the parcels on your behalf. “[If] you have a package you need to deliver, we charge you on a per package model,” Anuj says. Or, you can hire their bikes and vehicles. This applies to banks and insurance companies with sensitive deliveries.
 Also read: How Michael Wilkerson turned a side hustle into Tugende
 Currently, one can access them through the website. “Thats the per package model where you put in your respective dimensions and our pricing algorithm computes based on weight,” Anuj says. Though, the same platform supports those looking to hire their bikes and cars.
 The Godel team sits at over 20 full-time staff and around 80 distributed agents. The agents are for circumstances where it wouldn’t make economic sense for the startup to do it by itself.
 “If you have one package and weve only got one package going to Mbarara, I cannot send my own truck,” he points out. Adding that, “through our agency network, we are able to use what we call third-party logistics providers to move our cargo.”
 The startups’ main competition is two multinationals; German-based DHL and Aramex, the first Arab-based company to be listed on the NASDAQ. Apart from that, the country has a couple of other “informal players” that Anuj declined to point out.
 While as the bigger and more established players like DHL have unrivaled service delivery, their high price rates are a turnoff. Yet, the much smaller informal ones with a great pricing are inefficient.
 “A lot of the smaller players are using manual processes,” he says. “Yet companies want affordable service without compromising on the level of service.” Godel wants to position itself between the high-end players and the informal players.
 Given that they were spun out of an existing company, the startup already had existing clients. They also enjoyed the financial backing from Transtel. Which implies that they didnt need any external funding, and are not looking to do that anytime soon.
 Except, when the time for expansion comes. At that point, Anuj thinks that there’s a lot they will be able to learn from VCs and PEs. Especially scaling to new markets.
 “More than being from the financial perspective I would say you know the expertise that some investors can bring to scale the business that would be more of my focus.”

"[UPDATE] KCCA announces innovation competition with ridiculous T&#038;Cs
","Kampala Capital City Authority  KCCA  recently launched an innovation competition targeting university students and graduates. According to KCCA, the competition is looking for solutions addressing some of the challenges faced by the citizens.
 Innovation is one of the core values of KCCA and in support of this KCCA has launched the Technology Innovations competition targeting students and graduates who can give working solutions to challenges faced by citizens and the government.
 This year, the focus is on solutions that can improve reporting on their services. The feedback would be on a couple of on-going projects as well as other areas that are still lacking.
 There are a number of services offered by KCCA in the City which include; maintenance of roads, street lighting and waste management, they wrote.
 Adding, it is important that citizens have a solution where they are able to report to KCCA on the status of such services in their areas so that they can be identified and resolved by the right officials in the shortest time possible.
 Related: Does MTN Organize Innovation Awards and Competitions to Steal Ideas?
 Yet among its terms and conditions, for participating, one stands out in a very ridiculous way. It requires the participant to give up control over their innovations.
 KCCA requires that upon award of these prizes the owners transfer to KCCA the entire right, title, and interest in and to said Innovation, and any patent and patent applications deriving there from for any such innovation, it read.
 What is even ridiculous is that they do not specify exactly what the innovator will get in return for giving up their innovation. Apart from vaguely stating that its a cash prize.
 But, if youve been around the Ugandan innovation space for some time, then you know that the said cash prize could easily be US $1000.
 Now, the questions are; Is that worth one giving up their innovation? Is this a new way for corporates and agencies to steal innovations legally? Where will this leave innovators?
 Update: They removed the part requiring innovators to surrender their IP and any rights to their innovations. Check it out here.

"French Spirits Group Pernod Ricard Buys Stake in Jumia
","French spirits group Pernod Ricard is buying an unspecified stake in Jumia. This will allow it to become a “strategic shareholder” in Africa’s leading online retailer.
 The two companies will develop innovative distribution strategies in the region. The companies said in a statement. It seems the investment is to help Pernod expand its product offering to consumers in the continent.
 Pernod Ricard is present in 13 African countries. It says that it will share its expertise on consumers and physical distribution networks. While Jumia will bring its digital, logistics and payment platforms.
 “We are very proud to welcome Pernod Ricard as a new strategic partner of Jumia,” said Sacha Poignonnec and Jérémy Hodara, co-CEOs of Jumia. “This investment is an acknowledgement of the growth and innovation that Jumia has achieved since 2012.”
 Gilles Bogaert, CEO of Pernod Ricard’s Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America unit, said:
 
 “Pernod Ricard has made Africa its new frontier, as shown by the successive openings of subsidiaries over the last few years. Jumia is a partner of choice as digital and e-commerce represent real strategic accelerators in this region for us.”
 
 Paul-Robert Bouhier, president of Pernod Ricard Sub-Saharan Africa, added:
 “Our business relationship with Jumia traces back to 2016 with the successful launch of Jumia-Party. This innovation has experienced solid growth in cities such as Lagos, Nairobi and Accra.”
 Besides its online services platform, Jumia operates a restaurant delivery platform, Jumia Food. As well as a hotel booking service, Jumia Travel. Together, these represent around 25,000 establishments in Africa. Pernod Ricard said it will be able to rely on this network to develop the presence of its brands in the out-of-home segment.
 Jumias last round of funding was a Series C that it raised close to two years ago, in March 2016. The e-commerce giant raised over $400 million from six investors led by its major shareholders  MTN Group and Rocket Internet. To-date, they have raised a total of over $700 million in a period of over 6 years.

"In Brief: Malawi wants to make accepting digital payments a must for businesses
","The country’s monetary authorities are working on a regulation which would make it mandatory for businesses to accept digital payments. The regulation would require businesses in Malawi to have at least one digital payment channel.
 The Deployment and Usage of Electronic Payments Channels Regulation 2018 seeks to set minimum mandatory requirements for businesses operating in Malawi by facilitating and enforcing usage of electronic payment products for payment of goods and services.
 Electronic payment channels will include mobile money, mobile banking, point of sale devices, internet banking and products approved by Reserve Bank of Malawi.
 The regulation further says a business shall not surcharge customers on the usage of any deployed electronic payment channel, adding that any business that does so commits an offense and shall be liable to a fine of K50, 000 (around $4,200) for every surcharged transaction.
 If this finally comes to pass, startups like South Africa-based Yoco  which recently raised $16 million from Partech Africa  will be looking to expand into the Southern Africa country.

"Why I am launching Uganda&#8217;s first Founders Lab
","Entrepreneurship is a 26-hour day job and an 8 days a week commitment. That is the best way I can explain how much it takes to build a sustainable venture.
 It is easy to describe an entrepreneur as a person who undertakes risks to bring to life an aspiration. But, the description says little about the hours of work, commitment and sacrifice one has to make. It will not mention the judgment you face from those closest to you, for exploring a path less traveled.
 At The Innovation Village, we carry a belief that we should fix the broken innovation economy. As a nation, we are building and supporting our entrepreneurs the wrong way.
 No wonder 95% of these are dying in their first year of operation. Currently, I spend my 26/8  26 hours and 8 days a week  sitting down with Founders and stakeholders. Aiming at exploring new pathways to a different story.
 Through this journey, I have earmarked three challenges we need to overcome.
 1. The challenge of FOCUS
 Do any of these sound familiar?;
 First scenario: A young entrepreneur walks into my office and pitches 6 startup ideas. All at 10%, developed over a period of 6 months and no least viable product.
 Second Scenario: An entrepreneur believes he has the next big idea. S/he won’t bother sharing with you because you might steal it, yet you actually know 4 other people working on the same.
 Third scenario: An entrepreneur changes the business model to match a grant objective. Believing that this is a viable plan to build a startup.
 Fourth Scenario: An entrepreneur that hops from competition to competition. Hoping to win the prize money, instead of building their venture.
 Firth Scenario: A corporate with a business that can become their life’s work. But, they will never quit their job because of the things that might go wrong.
 I have had conversations with all the above. And, if they actually focused on one thing, they would be halfway to their destination.
 2. The challenge of STORYTELLING
 The British say “don’t blow your own trumpet.” The Americans say, “if you are lucky enough to have a trumpet, blow it.
 If you are an entrepreneur and you don’t tell your story right, how will the world discover you? Half the opportunities we miss out on come down to our inability to share our stories of impact.
 Again, do any of these sound familiar?
 First Scenario: My business is just…. insert any words that paint a picture of someone completely downplaying their work. A potential $1M story sold as a $1 story.
 Second Scenario: The fear of pricing right because people may not afford it. The best advice I have heard about pricing is;
 
 “think of a crazy price that you believe no one will pay you for your services and then double it — then work your way to why they will pay you for it.”
 
 Third Scenario: Ask any entrepreneur what they do and they will struggle to explain in a brief to the point. In fact, they might leave you thinking — why dont you find a day job?
 3. The challenge of our ECOSYSTEM
 How do you build entrepreneurs in an early ecosystem where you don’t have investors? Corporate partners are yet to realize the opportunities they might tap into. The government is trying to help but going about it the wrong way?
 How do you begin to connect the dots to the many independent initiatives? All which are competing with one another and together not delivering.
 How do you brand Uganda as a destination for capital? Yet search results are more likely to bring up chairs flying across parliament first.
 I have traveled the world. And, I am left convinced that entrepreneurial zeal is alive in Uganda more than anywhere. Unfortunately, all the 98% Founders I meet have one thing in common. They have got battered by the challenges that come with entrepreneurship.
 They become victims of reality and spend their focus on the frustration and less on their vision.
 The one lesson I have learned is that it is hard for all, but you don’t have to embark on this journey alone. You might be thankful for your own challenges if you listen to what other people have to go through.

 The Founders Lab will gather those seeking new pathways to their entrepreneurial journeys. It is for those interested and dedicated to creating, nurturing and leading something.
 It is for those that want to challenge assumptions and expand worldview of their struggles.
 Together we will explore how to solve some of our biggest challenges. And, soon, this is where you will find the people you want to meet  to take your venture to the next level.
 I am excited to be hosting Connor Sattely. A Business Accelerator Agent with HiiL — Innovating Justice for our first Founders Lab. Connor is passionate about building entrepreneurs.
 You don’t want to miss out on his insights and journey of building 40+ companies a year across the globe. Are you a Founder? This is for you.

 Ever wondered if JavaScript is a programming language or a scripting language, whether it’s a server-side scripting language or client side.
 Though being one of the most misunderstood languages, JavaScript is being used everywhere. The use of JavaScript has changed dramatically over the years and so has the language itself.
 The JS meetup on the 2nd of December, 2017 will aim at exploring the above. It will take place at The Innovation Village, Ntinda from 10.00 AM. The meetup will also have Tech talks, Flash talks, and Open Discussion.
 Four speakers for the event have been named so far. These include; Lorna Maria, wholl talk about developer communities, Ronald Kasendwa, to talk about react native, Christian Nuwamba talking about Vue Js and lastly Kato Julius talking about offline first (Chrome Apps).
 Launched in July 2017, forLoop Kampala is a community of software developers. It is part of the wider forLoop Africa  which was founded in 2016 as a community for every and any software developer.
 It is rumored that Africas Talking invested around $20,000 in the forLoop Africa community in October 2017. This was to help it carry out its activities. However, when we reached out to Graham Ingokho, Africas Talkings Developer Outreach, he neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.

"Jumia Uganda starts using DHL and Aramex ahead of Mobile Week
","E-commerce company, Jumia, is now using German logistics company DHL and Dubai-based Aramex for its deliveries in Uganda. This brings its number of 3PLs, Third-party Logistics, to three. Including the already existing Pink Tie.
 Until recently, little-known about logistics company, Pink Tie, handled Jumias deliveries. The company also handles deliveries for Kilimall, Jumia Food, Jumia Party, Jumia, KFC and Pizza Hut in Uganda. Thats according to a conversation I had with Jay Cho, MD of Motorcity, the company that owns Pink Tie.
 In its initial stages, Jumia Uganda worked with Amari Couriers and Makizto. But, they dropped both for lack of consistency in service quality. Something that was reflecting badly on Jumias services.
 According to a trusted source, Jumia received a lot of orders on Black Friday last year. Yet Pink Tie couldnt fulfil all. Something that resulted in many failed orders. This could be one of the reasons they are bringing Aramex and DHL on board.
 However, Jay refuted this. Saying that the two companies are still having the same relationship. Only that it is a different contract where hell provide drivers on hire. Under the new contract, Pink Tie will provide ten motorcycle drivers and one truck Driver per day. He called it a better deal for me.
 Yet beyond that, Jumia could be looking to foster more trust among its users. Given the reputation and respect, the two newly added logistics companies command in Uganda.
 I had a phone call with Ham Namakajjo, Jumia Ugandas Country Manager. He confirmed that it is true, the company has started using DHL and Aramex for deliveries on top of Pink Tie.
 We are just adding the number of delivery 3PLs we use, Ham said. Re-affirming that Pink Tie is still very much our [delivery] partner.
 Recently, Kilimall outsourced its Ugandan business to Jays company. Implying that he controls Kilimall Uganda. A direct competitor to Jumia. When asked whether the decision was because of Pink Tie having ties with Kilimall, both said no.
 Ham said that delivery 3pls work for multiple clients. Maintaining that the decision was as a result of growth in order volume. We want to make sure we cover the country very well, Ham said. Jay also added that Jumia has always used another company for upcountry deliveries.
 According to Ham, Jumia experienced tremendous growth after Black Friday last year. And he is not looking to take any chances ahead of the looming mobile week.
 Generally we monitor our delivery success rate, he said. Adding that the decision was driven by coverage.
 You want to be able to get upcountry or handle all sizes of packages.
 Though cagey about exact figures, Ham projects the company to grow 4x this year. We plan to grow about 4x this year, he said. Thats some crazy growth. You cant do business as usual.
 The company has also made some of its products in Uganda available on Express service. Jumia Express, Ham says, will be a 2 days delivery service. There are some things on Jumia express already that can be got within 2 days. But were making it 24hrs for Mobile Week, Ham said.
 Jumia Group has an in-house delivery service company called Jumia Services. This works with partners in each market Jumia operates.

 In Nigeria, Jumia Groups leading market, its website says that it already works with DHL. Others include UPS, Zippy, Trolog, Courier Plus and Exponential. In Kenya, the biggest market in East Africa, the company uses Aramex, Posta, Wells Fargo and G4S.
 Mid last year, there were talks of Jumia Uganda partnering with Posta Uganda to smoothen upcountry deliveries. When asked, Ham said he cant comment about plans in the pipeline. Adding that we are always working to optimize [our deliveries].
 Recently, Jumia said it had reached the threshold of 1 billion visits across Africa in 2017. Other groundbreaking figures for 2017 included the number of products available on the platform. This they say skyrocketed from 50,000 in 2012 to 5 million this year [2017].

 Some of those supported from Uganda, as cited from HiiL’s website, are Justice 2 People (J2P), Sauti, Wetaase, Evidence &amp; Methods Lab as well as Lawyers for Farmers.
 Barefoot Law, a Ugandan law firm that leverages technology to drive accessibility of legal services to the masses, was also part of the HiiL Justice Accelerator.
 For this years entries, HiiL has announced a call for application for innovators in the justice sector for the Innovating Justice Challenge 2018. The deadline for application will close on 31st May 2018.
 According to HiiL, “the three most pressing justice needs for Ugandans are Land, Crime &amp; Law Enforcement and Family Justice.” Which indirectly implies that innovations in those  areas stand a higher chance of getting accepted into the challenge.

"Nairobi-based Lori Systems raised $6.1M this year according to SEC filing
","Lori Systems, a Nairobi-based logistics company, raised $6,170,000 in funding this year. That is according to their Securities and Exchange Commission filing in January. This is the most significant external funding the company has raised. After the $25,000 received from winning the TechCrunch Battlefield Africa last year.
 Though it is not clear who the investor is, they are likely to be from the US. Given that US investors prefer their investees to incorporate in the country. And, from the SEC Form, Lori Systems incorporated as a corporation in Delaware in 2016.
 There is a growing list of startups and companies in Africa that are incorporating in the USA. This includes; Flutterwave, M-Kopa, PayGo Energy, Paystack, Lidya, Halan, mPharma and more. Most of them are being incorporated in Delaware.
 Joshua Sandler  the sole signatory on the form and CEO  founded the company together with Ernest Gichini Ngaruiya. Ernest, a Kenyan who resides in the US, also co-founded E la Carte, which went on to raise at least $35 million in VC funding.
 Over the past year, Lori Systems has undergone a significant expansion. Expanding from serving only Kenya to Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan. It also states Nigeria among the countries where it is present. Though there havent been any significant announcements of their operations there.
 
 The company has experienced 30% month-over-month compounded growth since product launch in May 2017, says Lori Systems.
 
 Three months ago, the startup said that it counted 70 employees on staff — up from about 15 almost a year ago. They also counted a network of 2,500 trucks using its service. The startup also partnered Kenya’s Standard Gauge Railway. The goal was to help reduce the costs involved by truckers in moving bulk imports and exports.
 Lori Systems operates a marketplace  Uber-like  logistics model. According to the company, they are tackling a massive issue. Across Africa, $180 billion is spent annually on haulage. This means that up to 75% of a product’s cost is due to logistics.
 Aside from Lori Systems, there are other startups in Africa that are tackling the problem.
 Y Combinator Kobo360 is among them. A month ago, we reported that the IFC was considering investing at least $3 million into them. They announced the investment  $6 million  alongside TLcom Capital Partners a week ago.
 The recent $6 million in funding brought Kobo360s total raised this year to $7.2 million. This leaves the logistics battle  across Africa  largely between Lori and Kobo360.

"We have helped 11 startups raise over $380,000 &#8211; Imuka Ventures co-Founder
","
 Startups are likely to point out lack of funding as their biggest challenge. Thats why, Imuka Ventures  a post-incubation accelerator  is working to bridge the lack of funding gap. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Roy Gakuo, co-founder of Imuka Ventures, told us how they plan on doing that. He also mentions the kind of startups they focus on, why they started Imuka Ventures. Roy also hints that two of their startups are about to raise 100s of thousands of dollars before this year ends.
 
 
  
 
 
 Startup Digest Africa: Whats Imuka Ventures?  
 Roy Gakuo: It is a post-incubation accelerator. Imuka Ventures focuses on early-stage startups with high growth potential and impact. It offers them tailored business development and investment readiness support. 
 
 
  
 
 
 We also provide other services like training and supporting business model innovation processes. Research, benchmarking and impact measurement and much more.
 
 
  
 
 
 What are some of the successes to date? 
 We have developed partner programs to identify entrepreneurs to support in our programs. For example, in Adansonia partner program we have supported over 300 entrepreneurs. These we have supported through peer to peer entrepreneur learning and sharing.
 
 
  
 
 
 In Imuka-Grow program, we are in the final stages with our first cohort of 15 entrepreneurs. One of them already won this year’s Anzisha prize of 10,000 dollars.
 
 
  
 
 
 We also have a partnership with Makerere Food Technology Business Incubation Center (FTBIC). We support the Graduate incubatees of FTBIC.

 What are the challenges of running Imuka Ventures in Uganda? 
 We have many entrepreneurs but few have the ambition, commitment and will to go the extra mile. 
 
 
  
 
 
 What are some of the lessons you have learned from this experience? 
 
 
 Innovators are critical drivers of their early stage businesses. Thus, an enabling environment with the right networks is very critical. Early-stage startups bemoan lack of capital, but oftentimes, its not the capital. A right strategy and model of execution is what they usually need.
 
 
  
 
 
 What is the future of Imuka Ventures [5 years]?  
 Imuka Ventures will have accelerator programs in at least two East African countries. We are also looking at an established fund to co-invest with partner investors. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Anything else people should know about Imuka Ventures? 
 We will be launching the Imuka Series at the end of November 2017. This will provide peer to peer experience sharing, networking and business support clinics. All entrepreneurs interested can send us an email: imukaventures@gmail.com

"UCC ACIA Awards are a scam initiative, says Evelyn Namara
","In January this year, James Wire Lunghabo blamed bribery at UCC as the cause of the delay in awarding prizes to the winners of the 2017 UCC ACIA awards. However, Pamela Ankunda, the UCC PR personnel came out and dispelled the allegation.
 UCC also went ahead and issued a statement in which they claimed that winners under the ACIA Awards Initiative [only] access prizes following achievement of agreed milestones contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the winners and UCC.
 But, last week, Evelyn Namara tweeted that next week, we will expose the scam that was #ACIA2017 awards. And yesterday, she tweeted a thread with allegations of how the entire initiative is a scam.
 Evelyn called out Uganda Communications Commission, the authority responsible for organizing the Annual Communication Innovation Awards, for organizing a scam initiative that claims to help innovators in this Country.
 In a threaded post on twitter, Evelyn pointed out that no award winner has been fully paid. For awards whose winners were named on the 26th May 2017, that implies over 9 months of waiting.
 
 The following thread exposes @UCC_Official #ACIA2017 awards initiative scam that claims to help innovators in this Country. #UCCat20 @FrankTumwebazek @Tybisa https://t.co/Jl9uqJOHuv
 — Evelyn Namara (@enamara) February 26, 2018
 These fresh allegations, from one of the award winners, raise red flags on the credibility of the awards. Evelyns Innovation, M-Voucher, won the ICT FOR DEVELOPMENT AWARD.
 M-Vouchers prize was $7500 and the rest of the other categories winners were supposed to get prizes ranging from an estimated $1,000 to $8000. But, according to Evelyn, they have only received between 50-80% of the entire prize. To receive the remaining amount, UCC is demanding them to finish certain set milestone achievements
 
 After a lot of pressure and many emails, last week the #ACIA2017 team finally sent us half (50  80%) payment. They now still require us to send milestone achievements for them to send the balance, Evelyn Namara tweeted.
 
 Though, this time around, despite all the rants from disgruntled winners and their supporters, neither UCC nor any of its leaders usually active on Twitter have come out to dispell or acknowledge the allegations. Even when she tagged the Minister for ICT and National Guidance, Hon. Frank Tumwebaze, under which UCC falls.
 What is clear is that most, if not all, of the winners, havent received their prize money. Though the reason as to why is not clear given that at first James allegation was bribery and Evelyns is milestone achievements.
 But, theres consistency in Evelyns complaint and the statement that UCC issued in January when James complained. That is attaching the award to milestones. Perhaps thats why UCC hasnt come out to issue another press statement to comment on the issue, yet.
 Though both Evelyn and TMS Ruge disagree with attaching the receiving of an award prize to milestone achievements. They argue that once one wins an award, there shouldnt be any anything attached to it.
 Because, as Evelyn tweeted, once you put up a Gala dinner and announce winners, you are rewarding them FOR the work they already did. Awards are meant to reward someone for the work or achievement they have already accomplished.
 
 It’s not an award if I have to beg for it after I won it. Imagine waiting a year to take home your Oscar because you have to pass additional “milestones”, TMS Ruge tweeted.

"Kalon Venture Partners leads $1.5M Series A for SA startup Flow
","South African venture capital firm Kalon Venture Partners today announced that a lead investment of R10 million (~ $1,465,400) had been made in local proptech platform Flow, an app that rewards tenants for good behaviour.
 With Flow, the first app of its kind in the world, tenants in South Africa get rewarded for registering, adding their property details, paying their rent on time, looking after their homes, and much more. Tenants can use the app and be rewarded for good rental behaviour even if their landlord isn’t active on the app (although, there are many benefits for landlords to sign up to Flow too).
 Great tenants can earn thousands of points every month, increasing their Flow score and accessing incredible rewards. For these rewards, Flow has struck partnerships with a number of leading brands in the lifestyle, entertainment, homeware, fashion and travel space, all of which are valuable within the lives of millennials (those between the ages of 22 to 37) – a group which makes up a large portion of renters in South Africa.
 The proptech startup was founded by serial successful entrepreneurs, Daniel Levy, Gil Sperling (Popimedia co-founders) and Jonathan Liebmann (a property disruptor and innovator best known for creating the highly successful Maboneng Precinct in downtown Joburg).
 In addition to the R10 million invested by Kalon Venture Partners, there is a co-investment of an additional R10 million from an international VC, which is in its final stages. Funding will be used to accelerate the development of South Africa’s #1 app for tenants; to fuel growth and increase the base of tenants already using Flow; as well as to increase the range of rewards available to tenants.
 Gil Sperling, CEO of Flow, notes that the property industry, locally and globally, is one of the few verticals which has not seen much innovation, making it an industry ripe for disruption. “Compared with any other industry, the property industry – and in particular the rental market – is archaic and disconnected.
 Also read: MFS Africa secures $2.5M to lower remittance fees to Africa
 There’s also a massive paradigm shift in how people should rent which is inspired and driven by their lifestyle choices and is something proptech could and should leverage big time. People are used to being connected all the time and transacting digitally, in real-time; and they want transparency in their dealings with companies (including their landlords). These are some of the key factors that inspired the creation of Flow. Through scaling with technology and economies of scale, we can revolutionise the economics of rent, providing a more seamless experience and more value to tenants,” Sperling adds.
 Kalon venture Partners CEO, Clive Butkow, said in a statement that the investment committee’s decision to invest in Flow was strongly motivated by the quality of the entrepreneurs and the proven track record they have. This combined with the tech offering that they have built and continue to develop, made it an easy decision for the VC.
 Clive expressed his admiration for the quality of the entrepreneurs that they have now added to their portfolio:
 “At Kalon Venture Partners we invest in technologies that are disrupting their respective industries and have large target addressable markets. Flow passed both these criteria with flying colours and also passed our most important investment criteria which are having the ‘A’ team. The three founders have all built successful businesses, which is quite rare in South Africa, and have the ‘execution intelligence’ to grow a product into a large profitable enterprise”.
 This announcement follows on from Kalon’s latest announcement in November last year of their investment into financial services chatbot providers FinChatBot.

"ARED surpasses halfway mark in crowdfunding campaign to raise €250,000
","ARED Germany UG has surpassed the halfway mark in its crowdfunding campaign seeking to raise €250,000. It is a Germany company set up to finance projects of ARED Group, a social enterprise that operates in Rwanda.
 
 The ARED Germany UG is owner and borrower of the project. She was established for the financing projects of the ARED Group (ARED  African Renewable Energy Distributor Ltd.), which operates in Rwanda, reads the company profile.
 
 Germany-based GreenTec Capital Partners, one of the investors in ARED Group, congratulated it yesterday when it hit €128,000. A figure slightly above the minimum fundraising limit of €125,000.
 Related: We raised funding from Greentec &amp; Village Capital, Henri Nyakarundi
 After raising the funding, from reading the details of the campaign, ARED German UG will then advance the funds in form of a loan to ARED Group.
 The ARED Germany UG is solely responsible for the transfer of the loan to the ARED Group, which implements the project on site, reads part of the details.
 The campaign is running on a Germany crowdfunding platform called Bettervest. With the current progress, It is highly unlikely that the company will fail to attain its target. Given that the campaign has over 2 months to go.
 According to the campaign details, the funds will go towards the production and installation of 80 mobile solar hubs called Shiriki Hubs in Rwanda. These will be operated by independent franchisees and offer important services to mobile device users.
 Shiriki Hubs are equipped with a foldable 135 W solar module, which is supplied by the German company Wattstunde GmbH.

 They also have a locking system for security as well as a router and an IOT hardware system, speakers and a lithium-iron-phosphate battery from Chinese manufacturer Winston Battery Ltd. All assembling takes place in Germany with the exception of directly deliverable parts from China such as the batteries.
 According to ARED, the Shiriki hub can offer the following services; mobile money, access to the internet, telephony, mobile charging and more.
 ARED  which is Africa Renewable Energy Distributors in full  is a social enterprise with operations in Rwanda and recently Uganda. Founded by Henri Nyakarundi, the company has a hybrid business model.
 So far, from my conversation with Henri earlier this year, the company has managed to attract a sizeable amount of funding. Some of the investors are Village Capital and GreenTec Capital.

"Uganda&#8217;s Innovation Village to launch startup fund
","The Innovation Village, a hub and incubator in Kampala, is launching a startup fund. Dubbed The 97, the fund will focus on startups that find it hard to get early stage investment.
 For a long time, a standard approach to nurturing innovators has been through innovation competitions and award ceremonies, writes the Innovation Village. But, these focus on the top 3 winners out of 100 submissions.
 
 In trying to answer what happens to the 97 ventures, we built The Innovation Village to be a destination they call home.
 
 The fund, thus, will continue with that vision of giving support to that group.
 The entrepreneur we are looking for is one whose venture or idea might not get to see the light of day if we dont intervene, says Japheth Kawanguzi, founder of the Innovation Village.
 The fund is at formalization stage. Though they are already having conversations with investors, and one has committed. The fund will have a combination of individual and institutional investors.
 Usually, funds have a size or a target they look to raise. The 97 is different, for now. According to Japheth, they are leaving it open-ended. It is an open-ended fund, not your typical $10M to $20M fund. That is because it is our first fund and we are experimenting a lot.
 As an early stage fund, the funding they will provide will go towards those at idea or prototyping. They will thus be looking to write ticket sizes not more than $100,000.
 The Innovation Village launching a fund is not an exception. Instead, it is becoming the rule across the continent. Especially as hubs are being forced to create an ecosystem around themselves.
 Theres is, therefore, a growing blurred line between a hub, an accelerator, an incubator and an early-stage investor.
 Nigerias Co-creation Hub and Ghanas MEST are among the hubs to adopt this arrangement. The former launched a growth fund three years ago which has invested in LifeBank, Riby, Edves and more.
 While MEST invests up to $100,000 per startup that it incubates. This year, they invested a total of $700,000 into 7 startups that participated in their accelerator program.

"The Bureau: Is it the &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; Ugandan Entrepreneurs have been Waiting for?
","The entrepreneurship scene in Africa gets more and more exciting each and every passing day. Those that follow the happenings will agree with that statement. This is partly due to the fact that most African youths see more potential in stepping out of their comfort zones and build a startup rather than sitting back and wait for the governments to handle the biting unemployment.
 This wave has swept across all the regions of the continent  though not in equal magnitudes. Yet, the regions that are lagging behind arent sitting back. Theyre doing whatever they can to catch up with their peers as fast as possible.
 Unveiling the Bureau to the public
 In this particular case, we focus on Uganda. It is still not among the top 5 destinations for investors and still lacks a couple of top class startups to its name that have stretched beyond its borders and getting everyone across the continent talking. Some people attribute this to the fact that theres no ecosystem in the country, those who are trying to do something are doing it alone, plus the fact that the government is doing little  if any  to help the situation at hand.
 Yet, there are still key individuals, organizations and institutions that have  despite the above challenges  stuck their necks out to help entrepreneurs and startup founders in the country. These have setup hubs/co-working spaces, lured investors into the country as well as inspired startup founders to keep going when they feel like its not worth it anymore.
 One of them is CK Japheth, Founder of The Innovation Village, who recently contacted us about their newly established facility  The Bureau. In a lengthy conversation, he was able to reveal to us the intentions of the facility and why they have decided to open it just alongside the already existing co-working facility which houses early stage startups, wantprenuers and freelancers.
 The Bureau accommodates partners to the Innovation Village which Japheth believes will establish a collaborating environment between the already established entrepreneurs, investors, accelerators, startups, wantprenuers as well as key thought leaders in the ecosystem. This is something that has been really missing in the equation.
 For example, Allan, founder of Intel World, that recently relocated to The Bureau was working from Kanjokya street. But, his neighbors were law and architecture firms that he may need to interact with but not on a daily basis as compared to being near Andela, Ace Capital as well as freelancers as is the case now with being at The Bureau.
 Evelyn Namaras !nnovate relocated to The Bureau
 Some of the partners/startups that have moved into The Bureau already include Andela, Enventure Enterprises, Milima Technologies, Britech limited, Kola Studios, Panya, Innovate mart, Leo Africa Institute, Open sustainability institute, Intel world, Challenges worldwide and Ace Capital. Those yet to relocate include FinAfrica and others that we shall communicate when we get an update.
 When you closely look at the above list, you can easily tell the variety in expertise as well as industries. Each of them has their own strengths as well as weaknesses  which when brought together can be a game-changer for the Ugandan eco-system. On top of the partners, The Bureau also houses an in-house tech team for The Innovation Village which it outsources to individuals as well as organizations in a project dubbed The challenge driven accelerator. The team is called SOLVE!
 
 Apart from The Bureau, The Innovation Village has developed a couple of arms each with the sole purpose of solving a pain point in the ecosystem. This is aimed at ensuring that a startup can access everything at one place. Look at it as establishing a one-stop Silicon Valley where you can get investors, talent to employ, mentors and everything an entreprenuer may need. It started with setting up Labs like Media, Climate Change, FinTech, Agri-Business, EdTech and Health labs. On top of these, they established Kampala Angel Investors Network.
 The Innovation Village as a business got funding from an undisclosed foreign angel investor to setup shop. Just like any other business, the facility has to become profitable in order to remain self-sustaining in the future. The Village is looking for further funding to enable it scale its operations in order to achieve the profitability goal. This is very crucial for them given the fact that some very promising hubs across the continent have closed shop in the recent past for failure to secure funding for their operations.
 
 Given that none of the very many arms established by the innovation village has turned a profit yet, the question we have is whether theyre expanding at a pace that maybe difficult to sustain in the long-run or theyre on the right track. Time will tell!

"4 Things Every Ugandan Startup founder Assembling a Team Should Know!
","Theres no worse nightmare for a startup as hiring the wrong talent. If qualified and experienced human resource professionals blunder during recruitment, how about inexperienced startup founders like you and me?
 There are good practices recommended by several top recruitment professionals and firms that will enable one spot the right talent. Yet, to a certain degree the entire process seems to embed some bit of luck. A startup and its idea are only as strong as the people working on it.
 From my experience assembling a team for SDA as well as working for Jumia in Uganda, these are the things i have identified that i believe anyone thinking of assembling a solid startup team in Uganda should watch out for!
 
 Part-time labor
 
 Unless you have deep pockets  a startup like Jumia has, be prepared for half attention. Most of the people youll get to work for you will give you only a portion of their time per day or during the week. Yet you can not blame these people.
 Lets face it, most startups in Uganda can not even afford to pay off internet for their employees, but these people have to survive. It is therefore just logical that theyll have to part-time, freelance or actually take up a full-time job somewhere. Your only prayer should be that at the end of the day they spare sometime and dedicate it to your startup.
 My advice is that, in case these people are valuable to your startup, dont try to push them so hard because while as youre fighting for your life (running your startup), they do have a fall back position and can easily quit.
 
 Varying passion
 
 I got to learn this while working on my very first startup in 2015. We were a team of 5 friends and ventured into making paperbags. However, just mobilizing for a meeting was hard  you could never get a full house. Later, i realised that some of the members were not as passionate as i was about the idea.
 Similarly, when i worked on an idea that translated into SDA, i had several members whose passion  anyone could tell  wasnt even 50% of mine. My quick reaction was always to fire there and then. However, overtime, i have come to realize that i am in the real world and try to handle someone according to their level of passion. This also helps me align my expectations as well as iterate the way i handle them to ensure i get the best i can get out of them.
 Say, a startup founder can easily do something outside their area of expertise. This is not the case for a person who just joined as an employee at a later stage. My advise; get to understand things from that persons point of view.
 
 Very Green talent
 
 One thing you should expect is totally green talent. By this, i mean people who barely know what to do. This has two sides to explain it;
 Number one is because the highly skilled and experienced people are not willing to (or cant) work for a typical Ugandan startup (look around you for one). This is because you can not afford their services, plus we all know how risky it is to work for a startup.
 Secondly, Uganda has one of the highest rates of unemployment in Africa (something i hate to repeat because it has been cliched a lot). This means theres quite a good number of desperate souls looking for something to do (even nothing) so that they can fill their empty stomachs. So, it shouldnt surprise you when you receive an application from only people with little or no knowledge.
 My advise; Be ready to train these people. Establish a critiria of how things are done and take them through a rigorous training thatll polish them into something you need. However, this doesnt mean that you take on every Tom, Dick and Peter. You should be sure to be spot those that are worthy your time and training.
 
 High turnover rate
 
 This is sad but true. As a startup, expect people to walk in and out of your startup at the fastest rate. Even those you baby sit and train  YES!
 Some leave because they actually think they can now steal your idea and put up a similar or better startup. While others leave  because they have got better opportunities. The truth is that as a startup, you shouldnt be surprised when you start feeding the more  established companies.
 
 My advice; This doesnt mean that you shouldnt train people. In fact, do the best you can do to equip them. After that, do the best you can do to ensure they are motivated, appreciated and challenged. Not everyone desires to work for the big companies or start a company. Some just like to experience the benefits that come with working with a startup.
 So, as you prepare to hire for your startup, have these four at the back of your mind. In case you have hired and are running a successful startup team, share your what other startup founders should expect in the comments.

"DATAHACKS 4FI: Hack for Financial Inclusion
","DataHack4FI is an innovation competition that promotes evidence-based decision-making for improved financial service provision to low-income individuals. The competition brings together data enthusiasts and financial service providers (FSPs) to crowdsource data-driven solutions to real-world challenges.
 The competition is aimed at the delivery of appropriate financial services to undeserved and low-income segments of society, in a way that enables them to meet their needs to consume, manage risks and unlock opportunities to improve their lives.
 The competition is set to be held in 8 countries i.e Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Uganda, Mozambique, Senegal and Kenya with the grand finale in Kigali, Rwanda. The competition seeks to promote collaboration between innovators in Africa and FSPs.
 It is open to many innovative minds across Africa. This competition and Hackathon weekend is set on bringing together data specialists (analysts and software developers) and FSPs to leverage tools and technologies for crowd-sourcing data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
 Big data and alternative sources of data will be a key basis of this competition, underpinning new waves of decision making, innovation and client insights analytics in the development of new financial services products that appeal to the undeserved/poor.
 This data innovation competitios is an initiative of i2i (Insight 2 Impact). In Uganda they are partnering with Laboremus, UNCDF and FSDU. The event will take place from 31st March upto the 2nd of April at The Innovation Village, Ntinda.
 Laboremus Uganda is part of the Laboremus Group and was established in 2013 as a stand alone profit center with its main investor being Laboremus Oslo AS. Today Laboremus Uganda has 18 employees.
 It was set up with the vision to build the IT sector in Uganda and in this way keep large IT contracts in the country. Currently, they are getting contracts from both private and government organizations as well as some from Kenya. This is surprising as one wouldnt expect Kenyan companies to outsource IT services from Uganda as the country is commonly referred to as the technology hub of East Africa.
 According to Laboremus, Uganda has many talented graduates and a growing market for IT. At the same time, few professional structures and expertise to handle large projects and they are often sold to vendors abroad. Laboremus Uganda wants to fill this gap and provide complex and high standard software services to clients in Uganda and the rest of the region.
 By doing this, they are creating much needed jobs for young graduates, as well as contributing to the development of the country by paying taxes.
 Laboremus area of expertise is Electronic Document Archives, Internet and mobile banking, Fintech and innovation, Mobile payments, Websites, Financial Inclusion, Microsoft Cloud, Office 365 Licences, Dynamics CRM, SharePoint, Mobile Apps and Data analytics.

"Rwanda&#8217;s Kasha &#038; Kenya&#8217;s Arifu raise $250k from Optimizer Foundation
","Kasha, an e-commerce startup that sells mens protection and contraceptives via an SMS-based, Arifu  an edtech startup -raised funding from the Swedish Optimizer Foundation. The foundation made the announcements towards the end of last month.
 The foundation invested $150,000 and $100,000 in Kasha and Arifu. Unlike the former, Arifu had before received an investment from the Optimizer Foundation. In September last year, Optimizer invested $100,000 into Arifu. The same amount they received this year.
 Kashas business idea is based on the fact that about 30% of schoolgirls in Africa stay home simply because they can not afford to buy binders.
 The startup, which started in Rwanda in 2016, has created an e-commerce platform. They sell everything from soaps and hygiene products to contraceptives. Through agreements with Unilever and Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kasha can offer cheaper products sent in discrete packages.

 Arifu  on the other hand  has an app that works like Apples assistant, Siri. The only distinction is that it does not need an internet connection or even a smartphone. Rather it relies on USSD.
 The users can text a keyword to a country-specific card number. Based on questions and answers, they are forwarded to relevant information about everything: from opening a bank account to streamlining their cultivation.
 According to the founder and CEO, Craig Heintzman, the Arifu app has about 800,000 users in Kenya. Founded in 2013, Arifu has been operations in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. They are also looking to launch in Zambia and Nigeria.
 Optimizer Foundation, which launched last year, opened an office in Nairobi the same year. The goal was to get closer to the East African market. The investments in Arifu and Kasha marked the fourth done in by the foundation, so far.

"Outbox and partners have launched another edition of Up Accelerate
","Yesterday [14/07/2018], Ugandan local business incubator, Outbox Hub announced the return of another edition of the Up Accelerate incubator program. The edition is dubbed Up Accelerate WAY which stands for Women, Adolescents and Young people.
 The incubation program is being launched in partnership with past partner UNFP as well as Reach A Hand.
 The United Nations Population Fund Uganda in partnership with Outbox, a local business incubator and Reach A Hand  a youth led organisation have launched another edition of its health based social incubator dubbed “Up Accelerate WAY edition, read part of the press release.
 Like the previous two editions, Up Accelerate WAY will also focus on Sexual Reproductive Health. The main aim will be to identify and implement innovative solutions that address challenges in Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) and Gender Based Violence (GBV).
 Though, this time round, the program will have a primary focus on women, adolescents and young people especially in Northern Uganda.
 Also read: These 5 individuals will be speaking at Kampala Innovation Week next week
 Up Accelerate WAY edition is focused on supporting young people (nationals and refugees) from eight districts of Adjumani, Agago, Amuru, Arua, Kitgum, Lamwo, Moyo, and Yumbe.
 The key words here are refugees as well as young people and women. Which perhaps is a reflection of an intersection of the objectives of the funders of the program as well as the area where the need could be most.
 At the end of the programme, it is anticipated that women and young people in Northern Uganda will increase their usage of Sexual reproductive Health as well as Gender Based Violence Services.
 The overall outcome of the programme is to enhance utilization of SRHR and GBV
 services among the women and young people in northern Uganda, including refugees, in
 order to realise their right to live healthy and productive lives.
 The organizers are therefore calling upon young people to participate in the incubation program. These should expect to receive training, mentorship as well as seed funding to help them work on their solutions further.
 Young people selected to participate in the social innovation incubator will receive
 business training, mentorship from industry experts, technical guidance and seed funding
 of up-to UGX 18 Million per team to enable them to realise their dreams.
 There havent been many opportunities for young innovators in Northern Uganda. Even in cases where solutions have been demanded for such communities, it is innovators from Kampala that have always been selected.
 A case in point is the Hack for Refugees which was a hackathon by UNCDF, DanChurchAid, The Innovation Village and Mercy Corps to come up with solutions to problems refugees are facing.
 This, therefore, is a unique opportunity for any talented and innovative young people in the region.
 “Up Accelerate WAY edition provides an avenue for talented young people in the Northern
 and West Nile region of Uganda to tap into innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities
 that are otherwise limited to major urban cities of Uganda. Outbox is excited to be part of
 such bold initiatives,” says Richard Zulu, Lead at Outbox.
 A couple of channels have been set up for those interested in applying to the program. This includes online through the website as well as offline at partner centers. The partner centers are upcountry.
 Up Accelerate is in its third year of running with this being the second edition and third cycle. A couple of interesting solutions like Teheca have resulted from the program. However, the question for many has always been market viability as well as continuity of the solution.
 This is partly because bringing health innovations to market is not easy. But also because there is a mentality of participating in a competition or program for the money. After which, the team is disbanded.
 Up Accelerate is mainly supported by UNFPA as its flagship innovations incubator. This in itself is a testament of where funding for innovation in Uganda as well as some parts of Africa comes from. Innovators as well as those that support them  including hubs like Outbox  are largely funded by development and donor agencies.
 Note: We had earlier on written that this is the third cycle of Up Accelerate. However, we have been corrected and since changed it.

"5 Things Ugandan Startups Should Consider When Choosing a Co-working Space
","Co-working has been on the rise and rise for the previous decade across the globe. Yet, the wave is just sweeping across Uganda. In the past, it seemed as though it is something only startups can take-on but lately even more established companies are buying into the concept. This is mainly due to the benefits associated with the concept.
 Despite all the buzz and advantages of a startup being situated in a co-working space, once one chooses the wrong co-working space, these may not be realized in the long-run. In fact, you might curse ever listening to someone who made the suggestion.
 Unlike before where we had just a few spaces to co-work from, now the number has grown. So, with this many co-working space options available in Uganda, how can startups choose the right one?
 We took time and spoke to freelancers, startup founders as well as researchers in Uganda to find out why they opted to work from co-working spaces. These were summarized into 5 and should be considered in your search for a co-working space for your Startup in Uganda.
 
 Internet Costs
 
 This was highlighted by Mwesigwa Daniel who operates from Outbox Hub. When asked the question, he simply said,
 Id consider the speed (and consistency) of the internet  Daniel
 It is no secret that internet prices in Uganda are not bearable especially to someone who is freelancing or just starting up. For example, on average, 2GB of MTN monthly internet bundle goes for UGx. 50,000 ($14). Yet, this can not even sustain one for a month.
 On top of that, internet in Uganda  just like power  is unreliable  hence the issue of consistency. You wouldnt want to be on a Skype call with a prospect or investor youve chased for long only for the internet to betray you.
 Therefore, for a startup or freelancer willing to operate lean, it is better to locate in a co-working space to cut on internet costs but make sure the internet is consistent. This you can do by paying a visit to the available spaces and interacting with the occupants.
 2. Price and Packages
 Rukundo Collin, who has worked in hubs like Outbox, Hive Colab and Venture Labs highlights this. As a startup in Uganda, chances are youre operating on a very lean or non-existent budget. Therefore, the least thing you want is any unnecessary expenses.
 Co-working spaces in Kampala do not offer the same rates. This is because they target varying audiences. Therefore, it is very critical that you do your background research and find the one that matches your budget.
 Secondly, different spaces have different packages. For example, there are some that will allow you to work for 3 days a week or others thatll allow you to pay for only the days you have showed up while others may have only fixed monthly rates.
 As a startup thats supposed to be lean, you need to be very conscious when it comes to this area. Do your research and ask them questions as much as you can to ensure youre getting the best deal.
 3. Location location……. location
 Phillip Simbwa, a resident at The Innovation Village and the Founder of Cardiff Network, highlights this. Phillip has several established companies but he wanted to run Cardiff Networks on a lean model.
 I stay in Ntinda and The Innovation Village is in Ntinda. It is also a quiet place to work from other than my home and my other office  Phillip
 This says one thing; always checkout the inside and neighborhood environment of the co-working space. For example, how far it is from where you stay really matters as well as how quiet or noisy the neighborhood is.
 You cant stay in Luzira and opt for a co-working space in Ntinda or cant opt for a co-working space whose surrounding restaurants menus are out of your budget.

 4. Impression
 This mainly has more to do with what the world around you or clients will perceive of you. It is often said that youll have no other chance to make a first impression. Therefore, the space youre opting to move in should bring out what you want people to perceive of you and your startup.
 The first impression should translate well. If i sit at co-working space and lets say Stanbic bank walks in, do they see a student or an entrepreneur? First impression opens or closes doors by default  Phillip
 5. Facilities and Occupants
 A co-working ideally becomes your office, thats why we recommend that you pay attention to which other facilities are available. Although youre going to work, you should also have fun as well as access to other facilities like restaurants, boardroom etc. Getting a meal to eat shouldnt necessitate walking kilometers. Remember your time is valuable.
 Secondly, something that was recommended by Collin, Phillip as well as Emmanuel Chagara  Founder of Milima Technologies, make sure the space has people who think like you. This makes it even more of a home than a work station.
 These are the top five factors that we think are most crucial to consider for someone looking at moving into a co-working space. When you choose the right one, a co-working space can be the perfect place to call home  for a startup looking for a space other than traditional office space.

"Gates Foundation Releases Open-Source Software to Support Access to Financial Services in Developing Countries
","On Oct. 16, 2017, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation announced the release of a new open-source software for creating payment platforms. The software will help unbanked people around the world access digital financial services.
 According to the official press release from the Bill &amp; Melinda Foundation, the software is designed to provide a reference model for payment interoperability between banks and other providers across a country’s economy.
 It is available now, free-of-cost, for software developers to adapt and banks, financial service providers, and companies to implement.
 The new code reduces complexity and cost of building payment platforms that connect poor customers to merchants, banks, mobile money providers, governments. Further information on the code can be found at mojaloop.io.
 Current data from the World Bank shows that nearly two billion people in developing economies lack bank accounts and miss out on the benefits and security that basic financial services provider, the press release points out.
 Yet digital financial services, such as mobile money on cell phones, have rapidly expanded over the last two decades because they are convenient for users and cost-effective for companies aiming to serve new markets.
 In Kenya, an estimated 194,000 households have moved out of extreme poverty due in part to their access to M-Pesa, a mobile money platform, and users’ ability to save money more effectively.
 Digital financial services are now available in nearly 100 countries according to GSMA, an organization representing mobile network operators. However, global expansion of these services—especially to the world’s poor—has been hampered, in large part, by a lack of interoperability between digital financial services and payment platforms.
 The new software, called Mojaloop, establishes a blueprint for connecting today’s financial services sector and can be used as a solution to barriers that banks and providers seeking interoperability have traditionally faced.
 Delivering financial services to the poor is prohibitively challenging for many businesses because they struggle to invest adequately in complex technology while maintaining a commitment to low-cost, inclusive services.
 This has led to a prevalence of consumer payment options that are out of reach for many people in developing economies, or which limit customers’ ability to transact across products, banks, and borders. These and similar challenges have dissuaded many companies from expanding into developing markets altogether.
 Mojaloop can be used by financial institutions and commercial providers, to simplify and reduce the cost of developing inclusive payment platforms.
 It was designed to serve ultimately as a model for national payment switching systems that, for example, enable an individual’s digital wallet to connect with her employer’s bank account and her children’s school account to complete monthly transactions. The code can also be applied to adapt and improve existing services.
 “Interoperability of digital payments has been the toughest hurdle for the financial services industry to overcome. With Mojaloop, our technology partners have finally achieved a solution that can apply to any service, and we invite banks and the payments industry to explore and test this tool,” said Kosta Peric, Deputy Director, Financial Services for the Poor, at the Gates Foundation.
 
 “Just as the internet revolutionized digital communication, open-source solutions like Mojaloop can spark innovation and democratize access to digital payments, empowering billions of new customers and driving massive economic growth in developing markets.”
 
 Mojaloop (building off the Swahili word “moja,” which means “one”) was created in partnership with fintech developers Ripple, Dwolla, ModusBox, Crosslake Technologies and Software Group, using cutting-edge technology such as the Interledger Protocol, a solution for settling funds among multiple providers across their individual systems.
 It joins other promising digital financial software but is the first model that can help extend interoperability from mobile money providers to any bank, merchant or government institution in a customer’s economy in a way that specifically meets the needs of the poor.

 “Interoperability is necessary both for financial inclusion and market maturity, but it is a complex thing to achieve,” said Benno Ndulu, Governor of the Bank of Tanzania, the country’s national bank.
 
 “We are excited to explore the implementation of this because of how it can simplify that capability for businesses and governments, and speed up access to financial services.”
 
 “As we modernize and develop national and cross-border payments infrastructure in Africa, the only way to sustainably reach and serve the world’s unbanked communities is through new technologies,” said Chris Hamilton, CEO of BankservAfrica.
 “Our aim as an organization is to offer national payments platforms for the next generation of financial innovators and Mojaloop gives us some tantalizing new options for doing that in a way that integrates with the entire national economy.”
 Developers can access the new software on GitHub, the world’s leading open-source development platform. It includes four components: an interoperability layer, which connects bank accounts, mobile money wallets, and merchants in an open loop; a directory service layer, which navigates the different methods that providers use to identify accounts on each side of a transaction; a transactions settlement layer, which makes payments instant and irrevocable; and, components which protect against fraud.
 Mojaloop aim to level the economic playing field by crowding in expertise and resources to build inclusive payment models to benefit the world’s poor.
 Alongside Mojaloop’s development, the project also brought together four mobile systems companies—Ericsson, Huawei, Telepin, and Mahindra Comviva—to develop an Open API for mobile money interoperability. These APIs will allow mobile money providers to integrate seamlessly with Mojaloop and products built from it.
 “In order to achieve the full potential of mobile money, we must evolve today’s complex and often fragmented digital payments ecosystem,” said Mr. Shi Yaohong, President of Software Product Line at Huawei.
 
 “I look forward to exploring opportunities to leverage Mojaloop to help us achieve our goal of bringing digital financial services to all poor and low-income customers.”

"Ushahidi changes problem statement after securing grant funding
","Ushahidi, a solution that was developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election violence in 2008, has secured an undisclosed amount in grant funding from The Rockefeller Foundation.
 We are excited to announce that The Rockefeller Foundation recently granted funds to Ushahidi for our Closing the Loop  Machine Learning for Humanitarian and Development Response project, wrote Ushahidi.
 At the same time, Ushahidi has also announced that it will be changing its problem statement.
 The firms initial problem statement was that; “marginalised people don’t have a means to raise their voices in times of crisis, and those who are trying to help them don’t have a way to listen to what is happening on the ground.”
 But, the non-profit firm says that  over the past three years  it has conducted technical R&amp;D and user research into solutions to the problem of matching resources to needs.
 The outcomes of this work show there is a current failure in the sector and a massive opportunity to build a machine learning application for matching resources to needs in humanitarian response.
 However, through expanded user research Ushahidi pointed out that they have come to believe that their platform, has improved tremendously over the past decade in solving the demand side of this problem statement: better understanding the needs of those who need help. No one, however, has cracked the solution for the supply side of the equation  which is automated, targeted, and immediate response to these needs.
 Ushahidi’s new problem statement, therefore, is: “how can community resources and skills be automously [sic] matched to allow for immediate response to critical needs during all types of crisis, thereby reducing human suffering.”
 With the support of The Rockefeller Foundation, Ushahidi will build upon this R&amp;D and our existing user base to evolve and scale the Ushahidi platform into a collaborative reporting and automatic response platform for NGOs, governments, and communities around the world.
 Founded in 2008 by David Kobia, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich and Ory Okolloh, Ushahidi has raked in over $3.5 million in grant funding over the past decade. Some of the firms notable investors include; Omidyar Network ($1.4M) and the U.S. Agency for International Developments (USAID) U.S. Global Development Lab ($1.5M). Though conceived in Nairobi, they have since gone on to relocate their headquarters to Florida, USA.

"4 Key CrowdFunding Lessons Ugandan Startups Should Pick from Esther Kalenzi
","The African society is set up in a more socialistic than a capitalistic setting. Hence, the age-old African proverb, It takes a village to raise a child. However, due to the sweeping global changes, this hasnt been spared.
 Though, a few socialistic tendencies still exist. Examples including the burials, weddings, introductions, and other functions. At these occasions, expenses are shared collectively.
 The same has recently got extended to people with illnesses that a family can not afford to foot or community problems that are a mountain for the affected to climb.
 Last week, Esther Kalenzi, the founder of 40 Days Over 40 Smiles organization, applied the same approach to help her finance a project. She was able to raise $5,057.
 Yet, despite the fact we are this generous, startups are still struggling to raise capital. They havent yet been able to crack the nut, which crowdfunding is. A few months ago, Fundibots  owned by Solomon King  tried to crowdfund for a project. But when
 A few months ago, Fundbots  owned by Solomon King  tried to crowdfund for a project. But when I asked Solomon how it went, he described the experience as terrible
 Here are four good lessons we learned from how Esther successfully carried out her crowdfunding.
 
 
 Communicate effectively
 
 
 40 Days Over 40 Smiles was looking for funding to build a learning center for children who cant have access to such facilities. Very straightforward and clear.
 When youre trying to get support for your project or startup, better have a good enough reason for them too. But more than that, you must communicate it with a lot of clarity and simplicity. You should be able to answer the questions of; Why they should contribute and for what.
 You should be able to answer the questions of; Why they should contribute and for what. People are easily willing to help if something plays to their emotions. Do include that in your communication.
 In most cases, it is very easy for us to assume the other person understands why we want whatever we want from them. And, this isnt true  especially if you havent communicated it well.
 2. Cast the net wide
 It is very easy for starts to stay focused and glued to a few people  immediate family members  when looking for funding. This may work out or not. Esther reached out to whoever she could. Whether you had $100 or $1, she welcomed you.
 Ideally, it sounds easier and more logical to approach one person to give you $5,057, but it will take longer than anticipated. Because, if am to hand you that much, you better sweat out a very good explanation of how I am to gain out of it.
 Yet, throwing the net wide will return with 10s of $100s in a few hours or days. Actually, it is easier for one to give you $10 without thinking that much about why as opposed to $5,057 at once.
 3. Relentlessness
 Esther kept people up to date with what amount was remaining. Everyone knew how much was remaining every after a few hours. This, naturally, makes people want to be a part of it. I mean, who doesnt want to contribute to what is moving?
 Even a person who has already contributed will be intrigued to do so again  just to see that the figure goes down further.
 So, as youre running the campaign, dont go and sit back after posting on whichever platform you will decide to use. Follow-up with the proceedings. If it has reduced by $99, let the people know that somethings happening.
 4. Get personal
 In most cases when we are faced with a challenge, we assume that posting it on facebook or any other platform is enough. No, it is not.
 Go ahead and make a personal follow-up. If someone shows signs of being interested, inbox them  request them to make a contribution. Remember what youre fighting for here  your dream  so you better put your pride on the side.
 Ask them to help with whatever they can. In the end, help goes to those who ask for it.
 I hope this will help you in your next or very first crowdfunding campaign to keep your startup afloat.

 The summit was born out of the fact that the journey of being an entrepreneur typically comes with a lot of challenges from capital, taxes and overheads, high rates of risk, less stability and so much more.
 Yet being a female already puts women entrepreneurs at far bigger challenges compared to their male counterparts. This has in the end subdued the growth of women in entreprenuership.
 Some of the main challenges faced by women in business include cultural constraints, limited access to formal education/training and management skills, lack of access to information and difficulty in balancing work and family.

"UPDATED: These are Africa’s 10 most funded transport &#038; logistics startups
","Transportation for both goods and people across Africa is a problem. The continent is still home to cities with some of the most notorious traffic jams making it expensive for people to get around. Beyond human movement, the poor transportation and logistics network has also made it hard for those operating e-commerce platforms to scale smoothly. 
 It is also not uncommon for one to order for a product from a neighboring country or within and have it delivered at a cost that it is almost equivalent to the price of the good itself. The industry, therefore, poses great potential for disruption and investors are taking note. 2019 is on track to becoming the year that transport and logistics companies became the darlings for VC  a place that has long been held by financial services and e-commerce ventures. 
 Below we take a look at the 10 transport and logistics startups that have received the highest in venture funding to date. Subscribe to Digest Africa to get access to more funding data about African startups.
 1. Swvl [$80.5M+]
 Swvl is a premium mass transit system that was founded in 2017 by Mostafa Kandil. The startup started out by providing buses to neighborhoods in Cairo before expanding its operations to other MENA countries as well as Kenya. As of the beginning of 2019, Swvl had plans to expand to Uganda as well as Nigeria.  It allows people to share a ride in a van or bus during morning and evening commutes for a fixed flat fare with no surge pricing. To date, they have raised over $80.5 million in venture funding across 4 different rounds. Some of Swvl’s notable investors include BECO Capital, DiGAME and Careem, though Careem divested their stake towards the end of 2019. The startup  which holds the record for Egypt’s most funded to-date  also holds the record for Africa’s most funded logistics and transport across Africa.
 2. Lori Systems [$14.9M]
 Lori systems provides a logistics platform for the cargo-transport value chain. Founded in 2016 by Ernest Gichini Ngaruiya and Josh Sandler, the startup plans to revolutionize the logistics industry across sub-Saharan Africa. Although the company has not been public with its fundraising details, according to their SEC filings, they have raised at least $14.9 million across two different filings. In January 2018, they filed for $6.17 million (which we classified as a Seed) and in May 2019, they made another filing for $8.7 million (which we classified as a Series A). Details regarding the investors behind Lori Systems are not public and the startup is not likely to make them public.  
 3. Sendy [$8M]
 Kenyan startup Sendy offers on-demand door-to-door package delivery services. Founded in 2014 in Kenya by Don Okoth, Evanson Biwott, Malaika Judd and Meshack Alloys, it has structured its model to help businesses ship their products using its trucks, pick-ups, vans, and motorcycles. Across 2 major funding rounds, Seed and Series A, Sendy has now raised $8 million in venture funding according to its CEO,Meshack Alloys. Some of their notable backers include DOB Equity, Toyota Tusho corporation and Safaricom through their venture arm.
 4. Max.ng [$7.5M]
 Lagos is becoming a critical battleground for many ride-hailing startups and MAX is one of those that are seeking to take a share of the market. The startup is on a mission to make motorcycle taxis safe, affordable and accessible across West Africa through its MAX app. Founded in Nigeria in 2015 by Chinedu Azodoh and Adetayo Bamiduro, it has now raised $8.5M in funding over 3 rounds  though this figure includes the $1 million that they raised in grants. The majority of MAXs investment was recorded in their recently concluded $6 million Series A that Novastar Ventures led with participation from Alitheia Capital and Yamaha Motor Ventures.
 5. Kobo360 [$7.32M]
 Nigerian logistics startup Kobo360 was among the African startups that were last year admitted into Y Combinator’s summer cohort. The startup has a digital logistics platform that connects truckers to companies with freight needs with operations limited to Nigeria but there is a clear indication that they will be expanding beyond the country into other African countries. Founded in 2017 by Ife OyedeleII and Obi Ozor, Kobo360 has now raised a total of $7.32 million in funding across 3 different funding rounds. International Finance Corporation, Western Technology Investment, CardinalStone Partners, Y Combinator, Chandaria Capital, TLcom Capital, and Verod Capital Management are among their notable backers.
 6. Halan [$6.89M]
 As the transportation and logistics market is getting hotter, new entrants are fixating themselves on being niche-focused. Egyptian startup Halan which was founded in 2017 by  Ahmed Mohsen, Mohamed Aboulnaga and Mounir Nakhla is among those that are looking to differentiate themselves through focusing on single vertical. The startup developed a mobile app that allows users to order tuktuks &amp; motorcycles and has raised $6.89 million in total venture financing to date across 3 funding rounds. The startup’s latest round of financing was a $4.28 million Series A that took place towards the end of 2019. Renowned Egyptian VC- firm Algebra Ventures led the round. 
 7. WhereIsMyTransport [$5.8M]
 Founded in 2008 by Chris King, Dave New, and Devin Vries, South Africa and London based WhereIsMyTransport collects and provides access to public transport data from cities in emerging markets. The startup then offers data collection, data access, and journey planning on their platform and has so far raised $5.8 million in total funding over 4 different rounds. Some of WhereIsMyTransport’s notable include Global Innovation Fund and Goodwell Investments. 
 8. Gokada [$5.63M]
 Founded in 2018 by Deji Oduntan and Fahim Saleh, a New Yorker with a couple of success stories already under his belt, Gokada wants to disrupt transportation across Africa starting with Lagos. On his LinkedIn, Fahim also lists himself as a founding partner at Adventure Capital a firm that not only invested in Gokada but in similar ventures across the South East of Asia. These include Pathao, Jobike and Jatri in Bangladesh as well as Picap and Muvo in Colombia. 
 To date, they have raised now raised $5.63 million in total venture funding across two 2 rounds. The company’s latest and most notable round took place in May 2019 and was led by Rise Capital, CRE Venture Capital &amp; Adventure Capital. Gokada was the first to announce that they were looking to launch a Boat hailing service in Lagos before Max.ng and Uber followed suit announcing their own services too.
 9. Mondo Ride [$5M]
 Mondo Ride is another ride-hailing platform with operations in Kenya and Uganda. Founded in 2016 by Himanshu Anand and Troels Andersen. Since launching, they have dabbled in offering both cab and boda boda services across their two main markets of Uganda and Kenya. Last year, it was reported that the firm had raised $2M in seed funding from undisclosed investors. The figure brought the total venture funding that the startup had raised to $5 million.  
 10. Little Cab [$3M]
 Similar to other ride-hailing startups, Safaricom owned Little Cabs that was founded in 2016 offers an on-demand service. Last year, the startup sold 10% stake in exchange for a $3 million in funding in an impromptu deal with an Indian fintech firm. At the time of announcing the $3 million raise, Little Cabs also added that they were looking to raise an additional $100 million in funding, there haven’t been any updates regarding the raise.
 Note: Startups like SafeBoda that raised funding rounds that could be significant but were not disclosed do not appear on this list. Similarly, Oride, which will benefit from Opay’s $50 million that was raised in July does not appear on the list as we could not breakdown how much of that financing will go to the venture.
 Update: A previous version of this article had erroneously pegged Sendys venture investment raised todate at $5.5M. We have since corrected that to $8M after Meshack Alloys reached out. We also changed Lori Systems rounds to Seed and Series A instead of Series A and Series B respectively.

"Tunga, a marketplace for software engineers, is expanding to Egypt
","Tunga, a marketplace for software engineers, is expanding to Egypt according to Ernesto Spruyt, the founder. We are planning to expand our community in Egypt in the short term, he wrote.
 As part of their market entry strategy, the startup is setting up partnerships in the country. In this case, we already have partnered on the ground through our collaboration with WeAreBits, Ernesto wrote.
 They are also organizing an event at the GrEEK Campus in Cairo on Sunday the 23rd of September. This is with the goal of meeting any interested developers. Those interested can apply and go through the screening process to see if their skills are up to standard.
 Tunga, founded in 2015, has most of its operations in Uganda with an office at Design Hub Kampala. Though Ernesto says that their community of developers comes from Uganda and Nigeria. With both countries contributing 45% each. The rest is distributed across Egypt, Kenya, and Cameroon.
 Currently, the startup has 220 developers and have served 100 cleints since inception. Yet what is more exciting for Ernesto is their growth and profitability. This year were almost tripling our turnover, and for the first time were running a profitable company, he wrote.
 Although were re-investing most of it into further growth. In summary, were a financially healthy, fast-growing company.

 The startup operates a model that is close to what Andela and Gebeya use. We execute software projects and hire out (remote) developers and development teams, Ernesto wrote. This implies that Tunga is contracted and further sub-contracts the developers. On the one hand, the client pays us, and we pay the developers.
 Though, unlike Andela, Tungas developers are more like freelancers as they can work from anywhere as opposed to going to an office.
 To date, Tunga hasnt raised any equity round. We did not receive any equity finance nor any loans, Ernesto wrote. Adding that to be frank, Im quite proud of that!
 But, they have received a couple of grants to keep them going. At the start, we received EUR 115,000 in grants from a group of philanthropic funds, he wrote. These were; Dioraphte, the DOEN Foundation, Edukans, and Triodos Foundation.
 They followed this up with another grant from Oxfam, though it came with conditions. [We got] around EUR 50,000 from Oxfam to recruit and train developers specifically in Nigeria and Egypt, under their ambitious work in Progress program.

"Uganda&#8217;s TMCG launched an AI health chatbot dubbed Mirembe
","The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG), a Ugandan digital health enterprise, launched a digital AI health chatbot dubbed Mirembe. TMCG has launched an Artificially Intelligent (AI) health chatbot, they wrote in a press release.
 This is one of the latest initiative from TMCG after raising $200,000 in funding mid this year from an undisclosed angel investor.
 The chatbot is named Mirembe, which means Peace in Luganda  a leading dialect in the country. Mirembe is personalized as a female personal health advisor. It offers free triage and care advice to health symptoms in Facebook Messenger.
 It has the ability to replicate interactive human conversation. This is by processing natural language and using predetermined automated text-based responses.
 SPONSORED: Find out how Unreasonable East Africa can support your business
 This ensures that most FAQs can get answered very fast. It also offers an easier and more accessible and affordable way to such services. Since the chatbot is available at no cost for anyone, anywhere and at any time. This also ensures that the already scarce doctors get put to better use..
 According to Dr. Davis Musinguzi, the TMCG MD; Mirembe is able to provide users with real-time triage recommendations and first-line health advice with a very personal touch.
 This is because the chatbots AI is built to process the health symptoms provided against age, gender, symptom severity and duration. It can also process known medical problems, and other clinical findings.
 To use the chatbot, search for Mirembe on Facebook messenger and select the Get Started button for the first encounter.
 For subsequent encounters, just say ‘Hi’, ‘Hello’ and Mirembe will respond. At the end of the encounter, Mirembe will provide the user with a summary report and the user can also rate their experience and provide suggestions.
 There is also an option for one to request a call-back in case they need support beyond what the chatbot can offer. This comes at the end of every encounter.
 
 TMCG’s 24/7 call centre medical doctors and pharmacists will receive a notification, review your submitted information and call you back to further discuss your health symptoms and recommend lab investigations and/or a treatment plan.
 
 According to TMCG, some of the questions that the chatbot can be able to answer include; “Do I need to see a doctor?, How serious might this be?, When and where should I go for care? and more.
 There is a whitepaper by Nigerian data scientist Oladapo O. Oyebode and Canadian researcher Dr. Rita Orji detailing the need of a similar service named Likita. Though, it is not clear whether they went ahead and executed it or not.

"An infographic of Kenya&#8217;s white tech startups executives sparks rage
","An infographic of white executives at some of Kenyas leading tech startups has sparked rage and conflict on several social media platforms. The picture has a couple of high profile individuals in the Kenyan startup scene.
 Jese Moore, CEO of M-KOPA, Joel Jackson, CEO of Mobius Motors, Johnni Kjelsgaard, CEO of Growth Africa, Daniel Goldfarb, CEO of Lendable, Claire Mongeau, CEO of M-Shule, Audrey Cheng, CEO of Moringa School, Alastair Sussock, CEO of SafeBoda and more are among those featured on the list of at least 30 executives.
 Silicon Savannah 2018 or should we call it [a] business community? Muthuri Kinyamu tweeted a caption of the infographic.
 While Robert Alai tweeted that he started complaining about the issue as far back as 2010. Adding that these  in the picture he captioned  were using Kenyas resources selfishly and would never benefit the country.
 Kenyan Startup scene. What I started complaining about in 2010. Every idle white person using Nairobi selfishly and will never benefit this economy in any way. All the tech cons in one picture, Robert Alai tweeted.

 On Facebook, Ian Bradley Wanjau doubted if Kenya is in fact among the leading African countries when it comes to tech. Leading tech startups in Kenya. You tell me! I dont knowWhere are your startups? he captioned the image.
 TMS Ruge, the founder of Hive Colab, and known critique of the lack of diversity in the African tech scene, mockingly described the Kenyan startup scene as model for diversity.
 Also read: Hive Colab’s TMS Ruge appointed to Andela’s Global Advisory Council
 The Kenyan tech scene is such a model of tech diversity it’s blinding, he tweeted the caption. Adding that technology empowers those with [the] power to disempower those without.
 Though some, like Ugandan journalist Timothy Kalyegira, didnt seem surprised. He noted that both in Europe and in the United States tech tends to be dominated by White developers, so hardly surprising if it is so in Nairobi too.
 
 While others thought that the person who came up with the infographic was merely biased and the sample they selected was just a fraction of what the tech scene in Kenya has to offer.
 Wheres @Africastalking @Jambopay @Pesapal ?!! The list is fronting a skewed view of the ecosystem which frankly is just pointless, David Okwii tweeted. Adding that anyone irrespective of their race shld [sic] be able to make it wherever opportunity collides with their personal dreams and ambitions.
 While another person on Facebook commented on Ians post saying I saw this and decided not to comment coz it aint accurate.
 Others also believe that the tech scene in Kenya is still dominated by Kenyans. The biggest Tech startups in Kenya have been founded by Kenyans, Josiah Otieno commented on Ians shared post.
 The difference is that the above companies have attracted some juicy funding but None is profitable.

 While on Jamii Forums  in an East African forum dubbed Kenya Startup Barley  a one Kennedy wondered why only a few tens were selected out of the tens of thousands of startups in the country.
 There are like 10,000 startups in Kenya. Where are the pictures of the remaining ones? he wrote.
 Kambala Nick also wondered why the infographic hadnt stated all the tech companies in Kenya and their executives. How many ICT companies are in Kenya. Why couldnt you show all the companies and their CEOs, he wrote.
 The issue of diversity in technology is a global issue with roots from as far as Silicon Valley. Companies like Facebook, Google and the alike still have challenges maintaining a diverse workplace. Despite the benefits of having one.
 Yet, for the case of Africa, it takes a different shape given the history of colonialism on the continent. Perhaps, many  when they look at it  what comes to mind is this race is coming back to recolonize us.
 A couple of whites in Africa know that they are at an advantage compared to the indigenous founders. This is because where the funding comes from as well as the formula used to dish it out are in their favor as per this report from Village Capital.
 Though, talking about diversity, when you look at the complaints and where they came from, one couldnt fail to notice that the majority  if not all  were men. This also exposes another issue of lack of diversity on the side of women in tech scene in Africa.
 Perhaps, this is also an opportunity for the men who complained to place themselves in the shoes of the women.

"Exclusive: Mauritius-based Talent2Africa Scores $1M In Seed Funding
","A report published in 2015 by Russel Reynolds Associates pointed out that businesses operating in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa face a growing executive talent gap and are confronted with a gap in traditional management skills such as team building and change management among leadership talent.
 However, the report went ahead to point out that the African diaspora is an important source of talent, though historically, it has been hard to tap into. As the economy expands, this diaspora is becoming easier to recruit in Kenya and Nigeria.
 Talent2Africa, a human resources startup specialised in recruitment and sourcing for talent has raised funding to solve that exact problem.
 An official press release Digest Africa has received indicates that Talent2Africa has raised $1 million from Saviu Ventures  a Seed and Pre-seed Mauritius-based micro-VC. Although the details regarding the deal have just been revealed, it was made public on January 18, 2019.
 According to Arthur Thuet, Saviu Ventures co-founder, this is the first round the startup has raised and made up their seed round.
 The startup which describes itself as the matcher of global African professionals with opportunities in the continent aims to make it easier for both the businesses and professionals to identify each other.
 Talent2Africa has arisen as one of the fastest growing companies in the HR sector, specialized in attracting international talents from the diaspora and top local talents willing to explore opportunities in their homeland or other African countries
 Talent2Africa was founded in 2016 by Chams Diagne quickly joined by Youssef Debbagh (digital marketing expert) and Benoît Martin (formerly Figaro Classifieds and Le Monde Group).
 Chams Diagne is notable for co-founding Viadeo  a professional social network with at least 6.4 million users  per the startups website. He is also credited for kickstarting Talent2Africa by launching it in Dakar, Sénégal towards the end of 2015 before the other co-founders joined.
 In September 2017, Talent2Africa embarked on global expansion by opening up their second and third offices in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire and Paris, France.
 In January last year, they decided to set up their headquarter in Mauritius followed by another office in Nairobi, Kenya, by February 2018 in partnership with the French chamber of commerce of Kenya. However, the startup is looking to cover more ground. This financing, therefore, will be used to fund Talent2Africa’s continued African expansion and continue the development of its proprietary technology platform.
 Currently based in Dakar, Abidjan, Nairobi, Casablanca, Paris and Mauritius; the company plans to open agencies in Lagos, Johannesburg, and Montreal in the short term.

"Yunga wins the HiiL 2018 Innovating Justice Challenge for Kampala
","The Hague Institute for Innovation of Law (HiiL) in partnership with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency at the Swedish Embassy in Uganda are executing a 3-year programme between 2017 -2019 called ‘Justice Innovation Uganda’. Through this programme, HiiL’s activities will ensure that citizens of Uganda, and in particular the disadvantaged, see more of their issues resolved fairly and effectively by a justice sector that is more innovative, open, transparent and accountable.
 Eventually, this reduces stress, violence, and poverty, and improves opportunities by increasing access to justice and making the justice system more inclusive. This programme puts existing justice data to work and uses it as a foundation to develop solutions and strengthen the justice system as a whole. The design is based on a collaboration where HiiL is constantly informed by what they have learned from the users of the justice system and for every outcome. HiiL works closely with the experts and entrepreneurs of Uganda that deliver innovative justice Solutions.
 On Friday 28th September, HiiL held its 2018 Kampala Innovating Justice Conference at Hotel Africana in Kampala showcasing its work in Family Justice, Justice Dashboard and results from this year’s Call for Innovations.
 10 finalists of the Innovating Justice Challenge 2018 pitched their Justice solutions to the Audience and a panel of Judges that consisted of Africa’s Talking’s Nicholas Kamanzi, Akili Ventures’ Dustyn Winder and The Justice Law and Order Sector’s Barbara Kitui.
 Yunga, a local rescue digital network for neighbors, emerged overall winner. The startup will, therefore, receive €5,000 in seed funding as well as join the HiiL Justice Accelerator Program. It stands a chance to be selected for a trip to The Hague in the Netherlands to join the Justice Entrepreneurship School (JES) with other selected innovations from around the globe.
 Coming in second was Tunga  an app that informs users about their employment rights  and the third was LegIT  a self-service platform that enables SMEs to generate legal documents. The Prison Officer Legal Empowerment Innovation by African Prisons was voted Audience Choice Winner. The winners from Uganda join other winners in next year’s acceleration program where they get access to financial and expert support for their projects.
 Since 2014, Ugandan innovations, and solutions have been accepted into the HiiL Justice Accelerator. Some of these include; mSME Garage (2014), Puliida, Justice 2 People and Lawyers for Farmers (2016) and Evidence and methods lab (2017).
 HiiL’s goal is to help 150 million people across the world prevent or resolve their most pressing justice needs by 2030. And the HiiL Justice Accelerator is one of the ways they are looking to achieve that. The accelerator scouts and supports the world’s best justice innovators on an annual basis with different themes identified each year. However, Land, Crime and Law enforcement and Family Justice have been the thematic focus for Uganda.
 This year, HiiL was looking to resolve pressing justice problems in the following 5 areas; Family Justice, Land- and Neighbour Disputes, Crime and Law Enforcement, Employment Justice and Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. These justice gaps are informed by the Justice Needs Survey that HiiL Published in 2016 and this data is used as a bedrock to source innovations.
 HiiL supports justice entrepreneurs with resources they need to scale their innovations and the Justice Accelerator is one of the platforms through which that support trickles down. HiiL avails the necessary resources and opportunities to the entrepreneurs that join its HiiL Justice Accelerator to ensure they take off. These include seed funding, subject matter experts, as well as access to potential future follow-on funding.

"Ventures Platform invests $100,000 into Nigeria&#8217;s MDaaS Global
","Kola Aina, a partner at Ventures Platform, has announced that they recently invested in MDaaS Global. I am excited to announce our $100,000 investment in MDaaS, he wrote.
 According to Kola, they arrived at the decision partly because of the team. At Ventures Platform, we believe bold entrepreneurs will solve some of Africa’s most important problems using technology, he wrote.
 Adding that in the past four months, we have only gotten more convinced that Soga, Genevieve, Joe, and Opeyemi will succeed.
 Yet, beyond the team, they also looked at the type and scale of the problem they are addressing.
 Across the country, and indeed in much of Africa — especially in low-income areas, access to radiology, cardiology, and other diagnostic services is poor, he wrote.
 The above, combined with the fact that most diagnostic centers are urban-centered seem to have convinced them to invest. It is not uncommon to see people travel for hours to do basic tests, Kola pointed out.
 At the same time, according to WHO, non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease will cause 46% of all deaths in Africa by 2020, up from 25% today.
 The MDaaS team which Kola and Ventures Platform got to meet early this year also exhibited rapid growth in the recent months.

 According to Kola, the startups first center went live in Ibadan, Oyo State (Nigeria) only ten months ago. Yet, in that short period, they have managed to reach break-even in month five and also grow their revenue by 500% since January.
 Founded in 2016 by Genevieve Barnard (CFO) and Oluwasoga Oni (CEO), MDaaS  Medical Devices as a Service  currently has operations only in Nigeria. Though hopeful to expand across the continent.
 The startup is building a network of tech-enabled diagnostic and primary health care facilities for clinically underserved communities in Africa. Basically, they can rent or lease out medical equipment.
 In June this year, MDaaS was accepted into the Techstars Impact Accelerator 2018 cohort alongside eight other startups.

"INTERVIEW: We&#8217;ve given out over 1.7 Billion in credit to finance contracts worth more than 5.4 Billion &#8211; George Bakka, CEO Patasente
","Patasenet is solving one of the many challenges businesses in Uganda face at different stages. For those starting out, their main challenge is capital to get started. Yet, even those that get the capital later get chocked by lack of capital to grow or finance contracts.
 In the previous edition of “Tell it All”, Anthony Natif faced a challenge of growth. Though he was able to secure private equity.
 Yet, there are some businesses that might not be attractive to PE or VC funds. Plus, they may not be looking to deal with investors or even giving away a stake in their business.
 That’s exactly where George William Bakka’s Patasente comes in. In this edition of Tell it All, George walks us through his journey. From Angels Initiative up-to when he and the team founded Patasente. A fintech startup that’s given out over 1.7 Billion shillings in credit, to finance contracts worth more than 5.4 Billion shillings.
 Malinz: Tell me about Angels Initiatives.
 George: So, we began a company called Angels Initiatives in 2010 with a group of three friends. Joachim Ewechu, Ivan Mandela and Gilbert Mutungi.
 The entire concept was to co-create ideas into high impact companies. That meant we not only had to find good ideas we could build into big companies, but also the risk capital to grow them.
 Our model then became that we would need to partner with other organizations. We looked at foundations and larger companies. They would provide the risk capital to allow us to launch companies.
 Between us, we have set up 8 companies, sold 2, collapsed 3 and currently operating 3 active companies.
 For example, very early on in 2011, we did Mara Launchpad. That was in partnership with Mara Foundation. Mara Launchpad was a shared office facility.
 Malinz: Which year did you do Mara launchpad?
 George: We did Mara Launchpad in January 2012 and sold it in December 2012  after a year.
 Malinz: Whom did you sell it to and why sell it too soon?
 George: We sold it to our partner  Mara Foundation. Our model is to start a business, grow it up to a stage where someone can buy us out.
 Malinz: Which year did the four of you come together and decide to launch Angels Initiative?
 George: We were actually in school. That was 2010. We all went to St. Marys College Kisubi  SMACK. So, as soon as we left high school, we dived into this right away even before we went to campus [University].
 Malinz: What did you follow-up with after the sale of Mara Launchpad?
 George: So we did Mara launchpad in 2012. When we exited that, we did Unreasonable East Africa. An accelerator that provides mentorship and access to capital.
 Then, in 2014, we did Angels Hub. Another professional affordable work-space business located in Ham Towers. That was also later sold to Ham Enterprises [owned by Hamis Kiggundu].
 Malinz: Does Angels Initiative own a stake in Unreasonable East Africa?
 George: It is an NGO. So we cant own stake in it. My colleagues, Ivan and Joachim run it.
 Malinz: So, after selling off Angels Hub, what did you now embark on?
 George: By 2016, we had started 3 successful enterprise development companies. But noticed most of the start-up clients in the workspace registered static growth.
 A company would take up space making say UGX 5m per month at the start of the year. Yet end the year with more or about the same [amount]. While a few went on to become bigger businesses. Like Media 256, Siraco Irrigation, Ego SMS etc, a couple of others either stagnated or fizzled out.
 So, we began thinking that the issue was not a work-space alone. Plus getting them mentors and stuff as it was. But, also looking at the critical aspects of what drives their business.
 Thats when we started to experiment with finance. Because it emerged as the biggest impediment to their growth. Someone starts and attracts clients. But then gets this breakthrough deal or contract and they cant execute it. Because you have no money.
 Malinz: Talking about finances, I am going to take you a little bit back. You said that you were out of school but able to set up Mara Launchpad. How were you able to do that?
 George: The model is that we look for a venture partner in the domains we seek to launch into.
 Malinz: I understand. But, in this process of looking for a venture partner, you must pay transport to go to meetings. Where were you able to get money for that?
 George: You mobilize. If youre four people, even if each of your parents gave you a small allowance of UGx. 100,000 a week, thats a good UGx. 400,000 a week as a group. So, youd push around.
 For us, the entire point was that we had a scale of ambitions that didn’t match the breadth of our resources. The least we could do is get an obsessive focus on what we wanted to do. And somehow, it worked out.
 What most people do is ok, this is what I have. Let me plan around this. Weve been different from that. We dream then try to see how do we fall there. So, we have an obsessive drive of where we want to go. Its based on catalytic progressive action and less reaction.
 Malinz: How did you convince Mara Foundation to partner with you?
 George: You start from the point of this is what I want to do. Where do I find the capital? You also ask yourself whos out there that can finance us.
 So, it is not a flip of the other one. In most cases, we start(ed) with what we want to do and who out there would be willing to finance us.
 [After identifying them] we would go and talk to them. So, thats how we convinced Mara Foundation to say, Let me invest $30,000.
 Thats it. But like I said, we talked to a lot of folks. A few foundations. Some said, Do these young boys have the capacity to execute it? But some trusted us.
 Malinz: Now, you were talking about ventures that had a finance problem. What exactly was the problem?
 George: They were not exactly making that leap of growth, right. So, you have hustled and set up a company but now you want to move from 5 million to 10, to 20 and so on. Of course, you need[ed] some kind of [external] money.
 Many banks are not willing to lend them for a couple of reasons. From high costs of complex due diligence to loan monitoring. Coupled with the fact these business lack collateral security. They also have no significant credit history. They consider them risky.
 The alternatives thus are money lenders. Who lend at very high rates and commensurate to the security provided. But, money lenders also sometimes want security. So for the value of a television set, you get UGX 800,000 from a money lender, can you execute a UGX. 10 Million order?
 So, even if you said that let me take my vehicle, still if you fix that asset, what will you fix for the next contract? To us, it was a bit of cyclical. Instead, we asked ourselves why not think of something else around it?
 We began thinking that if these entrepreneurs have worked their a**ses off and found contracts to execute, can we base on that first? Because [getting the contract shows] theres already a certain level of commitment from this young entrepreneur towards his or her business.
 But also, how do we convince ourselves that this person will actually payback? So the question was whether we can base the decision to lend or not on the capacity of that [one] who gives them the contract to pay? In other words the creditworthiness of their final client?
 If Julius [a friend] gets a contract to supply electronics to Inyamat [a restaurant we were in]. And he needs UGx. 10,000,000, then we have to analyze whether Inyamat has the capacity to pay. Then we make a decision of whether we extend credit to Julius or not.
 In not lending Julius, we also save him the burden of doing business for a client who would end up not paying him.
 Malinz: So, where did this lead you?
 George: That was the entire concept that laid the foundation for a new initiative. Patasente. We began thinking about this in 2015. Only thinking about it.
 Malinz: By we, do you mean all the four people you started with Angels Initiative?
 George: Yes. What we do is that we are four partners but each of us has certain orientations. So, the idea is to set up a company under Angels Initiatives and one of us runs it. Sometimes, its either a group or an individual saying that ok, I am thinking about this. Can you guys look at what resources we have? So yeah, I would say a group initiative throughout.
 Malinz: Now, beyond thinking about the concept, when did you decide to breathe life into it?
 George: It came to life in 2016. It took on the name Patasente. Pata is a Swahili word and sente is Luganda. Pata means to get and sente means money. The name is Get Money.
 Malinz: What would you say Patasente is?
 George: It is a supply chain financing platform. We enable businesses do electronic procurement, settle payments and receive working capital loans against orders and invoices.
 The system also analyses users’ transaction data and provides credit scores used as a basis for lending. So Kojja Foods can receive an e-order and send an e-invoice to Inyamat Restaurant which gets paid via the system t either mobile money or bank.
 That transaction record bolsters the Patasente Credit Score attached to every user on the system. It also determines how much credit they can access anytime from Patasente.
 Malinz: You talked about procurement, payment and access to credit. Does the last one have a condition that a business must have been using Patasente for the first two?
 George: Absolutely. Because, like I mentioned, how do we assess that Inyamat is a good client? It is very hard for us to ask them for their bank statement. So, we need[ed] a way to assess that the company can actually and will pay. We look at [only] the transactions within the [Patasente] platform.
 If Inyamat continues buying Matooke and receiving cash from X, Y and Z [through Patasente], it allows us to have an idea. That allows us to make a credit decision.
 But, in circumstances where may be, we cannot analyze your buyer as good, then at least we will be able to analyze you and say okay basing on such and such transactions, the business can absorb our 50 million shillings. But, at least one of you has to be on our platform. And, has to have been transacting on it. Its pretty much on the start, but is picking up as many more businesses sign up to the platform.
 Malinz: What if am here as Inyamat and have never used your platform. But then theres a client, lets say USAID. Both of us have never used your platform and i need to service this contract. Cant you base on the reputation of the client?
 George: In certian specific circumstances, we might consider it. Especially where we are able to sign a tripartite agreement between us, the buyer and borrower (our client). Save that, we will not. Especially because weve tried it.
 Its two years now and there have been scenarios where you think thats true. Yet, its not. Because of the different payment dynamics involved in different business relationships.
 Malinz: Has it happened before?
 George: Yes. It has happened before.
 Malinz: Which client was that?
 George: It would be dangerous to put these clients out there to the public at this moment. The reputation damage might affect their businesses. But we are having internal conversations on whether to publish such things or not in the future.
 Because itll also assist us to tell some businesses that dont do business with this particular client. That they dont have the capacity to pay you. Especially if youre a young business and all you have is 30, 40 or 50 million shillings. Then do work for a certain client and they dont pay you, youre buried.
 So, we are still having the conversations. It might happen. But for now, we are not at liberty to mention.
 Malinz: They invited you for the AB Imbev Global Entrepreneurship Week at Nile Breweries last year (they invited me too). And, Nile Breweries works with farmers  especially barley. I would like to know, are you extending your services to these people?
 George: We are getting big into the Agriculture industry. Especially where theres a lot of suppliers that need advance payments on the orders they receive before they execute.
 We have started in the milk industry. Thats farmers who are supplying milk to processing companies. That was as far as last year. But this year we might look into the sugar industry, the barley industry and stuff like that. By which Nile Breweries would become a partner.
 Malinz: When you talk about sugar, are you looking at Out-growers?
 George: Yeah. Out-growers mostly.
 Malinz: Thats too much emphasis on Agriculture. Why the move?
 George: We are in an Agricultural country. So, most likely the majority of the businesses within Uganda are going to be [around] Agriculture. But also, because we are still a factor economy. More than 40% of your earnings  either of a person or household  will most likely go to food in some way.
 So theres already a lot of cash going around in Agriculture. Which is of course very attractive to the Patasente business. Because for us to be able to lend, we need buyers and suppliers. Buyers who are liquid and suppliers who can supply. You have to look at the larger scale  where are people spending their money.
 Malinz: Talking about industries, which other industries are you looking at?
 George: We are into construction, though not so big there. Currently, it is agriculture and construction.
 Malinz: What are your metrics for determining the ideal client for Patasente?
 George: Of course, we categorize all our clients from micro-suppliers to small-scale suppliers. But, a micro supplier that qualifies to get financing from us should be earning $3,000 to $30,000 per year. Small businesses must be around $, 30,000 to 300,000 per year and medium businesses between $ 300,000 to 3,000,000 per year. Our lending structure takes into consideration your annual revenue structure.
 Malinz: What are your numbers for the two years that you have run operations?
 George: So far, we have done about 1.7 Billion Shillings in credit. And we have funded contracts worth about 5.4 Billion shillings. We have more than 500 active users on our platform.
 Malinz: Could you break down credit and contract value more? Plus, how do you make money in the process.
 George: If say, Kojja Foods get a UGX 50m contract to supply maize flour to St Marys College Kisubi. But needs UGX 43m to execute it. There is profit margin difference of UGX 7m. Depending on the inherent risk score within a given contract, we take a % of the profit margin. As the return on our capital.
 Malinz: But, how do you determine what you take? Is it a standardized percentage or a dynamic arrangement for each client?
 George: It is dynamic. We assess basing on the level of risk. Like I mentioned, we are doing a Patasente score of all clients. Depending on how much youre scoring, we base on that to determine how risky youre. The higher the risk, the higher the percentage we take.
 Malinz: Do you have a percentage range you play within?
 George: Yes, we do. It ranges between 5-15% in net interest return on lent funds.
 Malinz: You talked about some businesses not honoring their invoices. Apart from that, what other challenges are you facing?
 George: Let me first explain a little bit about where the Patasente money comes from. Once we approve a contract we are going to finance, we sell promissory notes to lenders.
 It could be that you have 10 million shillings stashed somewhere. And, theres Julius who is supplying to Inyamat. So, we will come to you and tell you that hes supplying Inyamat. If he can pay you 1 Million on top of your 10 Million shillings, you give it us. We then pass it to him, he executes, he pays us and then we pay you.
 So, theres that element of getting external folks with cash who can invest in these contracts. But, one of the huge challenges we have had on that end is that most lenders in Uganda are the very short term. They want their money to go and come back within 30 to 90 days. Most likely after 30 days.
 Now, thats not how the economy works. Some folks take between 90 to 180 days [to pay back]. Which is 3 to 6 months waiting on the payments from a specific supplier or buyer. Thats one of the challenges that we have. There are folks willing to lend but want the money back as fast as possible.
 [Another challenge is that] they not only want their money to come back early, they also want very high rates. Some say, okay, I am going to invest 10 million in Julius contract but I want it to return 2 million shilling in 30 days. Thats 20% rate.
 But, what is Julius making off that contract? Hes not even making 2 million shillings. He is making UGX 500,000. So, you end up with an issue of high rate capital thats short-term yet businesses are not making that much. But we are working around it.
 Malinz: I have two questions to follow-up on that and we wind up. Talking about the lenders, are they institutions or individuals? Number two, you talked about the challenges, how are you looking at mitigating them?
 George: We are getting money from both individuals and institutions. Therere people organized either as individuals or investment clubs seeking to lend money.
 How are we curbing it? Right now, we are engaging our lenders. Telling them that hey, the best-case scenario that money will return is 90 days. But, sometimes it might an extra 90 days as a delayed payment. So, we are looking for folks who are a little bit more long-term.
 We are also encouraging them to diversify across a portfolio of loans. Such that one delayed payment does not frustrate their entire invested capital.
 We are also looking out for longer-term investors as well as cheaper sources of capital. Which we will get.
 Malinz: Any last words?
 Much of our credit is getting to be reliant on performance on our platform. Yet the behavior of businesses in Uganda is that theyll do their things in person. Some people talk in person or order on phone. They still do verbal contracts.
 So, you have to move behavior of businesses to thinking about normal procurement. Then move them to actually being electronic. So, of course, theres going to be a gap around how do we convince that business community. To adopt e-procurement and keep electronic data that you can actually analyze. Then, base on that to push out credit.
 Thats still a challenge but we will start with those who are willing to start. Because the more folks we have on the platform, the easier it is to attract capital from many sources. Even globally.
 Malinz: I know I asked the last questions, but this is a conversation we cant finish in less than an hour. Because what youre doing is interesting. Especially that it involves collecting data and using that same data to make decisions. But, have you thought of getting an in-house fund from which you can be able to finance these contracts?
 George: Yes. Patasente has an Internal Fund that funds 20%- 50% of all the loan requests that we approve. So, by the time we approve you and say that you qualify, we have already committed a % of that cash. We go out to lenders to only look for the other balance.
 [Currently], theres an internal fund that we are building. If we get a few more folks joining our wagon, we will be able to increase how much we commit as Patasente. Because we want to move more credit. And, the benefit with supply chain finance is that it depends on the movement of goods. If people are moving goods faster, that means theres more trade and more production.
 Malinz: How do you identify an ideal lender? Do you approach them, is it word of mouth or they approach you? And, do you have a cap?
 George: Last year, we were testing out this. I have to say even us were not sure this was going to work anyway. But now we have some primary data. Two years ago, it was bewildering to tell anyone that actually, I can lend out 50 million shillings without security. But people are beginning to pick up.
 We tell folks not to lend Patasente platform anything above 20% of their annual income. Because despite the fact that we do all the analysis, it is still unsecured credit. Theres still a certain level of risk. If the contract is not paid, theres actually a potential loss. This is an actual investment where you can make and lose money.
 But, even when youre to invest, dont invest in only one contract. Diversify. Because then you have 1/10 chances of losing money.
 Malinz: For the last time, what are the institutions youre working with?
 George: The institutions are coming in to assist us to be able to filter our internal fund. So, we have USADF, they are a big partner of ours as well as Citi Foundation. Citi Bank, its parent, is a globally recognized supply chain financing bank. This is an exciting experience on board for them.
 Malinz: What are they bringing on board? Finance?
 George: It is capital of course; but we are still on the lookout for more partners. We want to grow this internal fund to at least US $ 10. Then we can say, we are putting a dent in the enterprise sector in Uganda.

"KAIN partners with Investment Clubs to invest between $10k &#8211; $100k in Uganda&#8217;s early-stage startups
","Yesterday, Kampala Angel Investors Network  KAIN, launched KAIN DEAL Day. They are organizing it with support from Africa Business Angels Network  which KAIN is already a part of.
 According to CK Japheth, from KAIN, this is a quarterly engagement between investors and entrepreneurs with a view of investing in early-stage entrepreneurs.
 
 [This is a collection of] select investment clubs that are tired of traditional investment options of land and property. We haven’t deliberately recruited investors but have been overwhelmed by the interest making the move inevitable, CK Japheth
 
 The event will see, as Japheth put it, select investment clubs that are tired of traditional investment options of land and property invest between $10,000 to $100,000 in a couple of early-stage startups thatll have a chance to face the investors and come out successful.
 Founded in 2016, KAIN has been engaging different investment clubs to interest them in investing in early-stage startups. An area many had ignored due to the high risk associated with it, preferring the traditional modes of investment like Agriculture and real-estate.
 Given that different communities and ecosystems have different understanding and meaning of different words and phrases. We, therefore, asked Japheth to clarify on what, as KAIN, they imply by early-stage startups, to which he said that they are recently founded startups looking with proof of concept preferably with some capital.
 Currently, they dont have a complete and final list of startups to face the investors for the deal day. However, Japheth is positive that this isnt the biggest challenge as they have criteria of application and all Entrepreneurs will be vetted before they meet investors. The business and operating model must be viable.
 On top of that, KAIN is currently planning to enrol various entrepreneurs in their master classes to get them investor ready.
 
 Most of them are not yet ready to face up with investors. We shall run Masterclasses before the Deal day and select the first 10 that will get a chance to meet our angel investors, CK Japheth said.
 
 KAIN has been open to applications from entrepreneurs and startups looking for funding since 2016. So far, they have over 40 applications. Though, they are looking at more applications.
 We have received applications from 43 since 2016. And are still calling for more since this is quarterly, CK Japheth.
 Though Japheth did not disclose who the investment clubs are, he informed us that they are 10 in number. And, they are looking at invest in with ticket sizes ranging from $10,000  $100,000 per startup. Though, he added that a current collaboration with BiD Network might see that figure go higher.
 We are looking at anywhere between $10,000 to $100,000 but our recent collaboration with BidNetwork means we have access to their Angels who are looking to invest up to $2.5M, CK Japheth.
 KAIN isnt the first to organize a deal day on the continent. In 2016, Nigerias Lagos Angel Network launched their quarterly Deal Day. However, little is known about the impact. Others are already doing it but behind closed doors. (See also: Why BMCE’s AEAwards launched an Angel Investors Network, African Entrepreneurship Angels).
 It should, however, be noted that investment, not only from angels, is an entirely new concept in Africa. A continent where most people started businesses for subsistence rather than commercial purposes. This implies that one had to plan with what they had at their disposal.
 Yet, it is interesting how it is fast becoming part of the daily vocabulary. But, it also seems the rate is as fast as the demand. For example, despite the fact that Africa Business Angel Network has over 60 members (some actually inactive), very few have registered tangible successes. Those few being Cairo Angels in Egypt, whose investment in Orcas last year was their 20th and Viktoria Ventures in Kenya who made their first investment last year.
 Though, one would argue that actually, even the results being achieved by Cairo angels could be accrued to the fact that it is also a member of the Middle East Angel Investment Network (MAIN).
 In June last year, David van Dijk, the Director-General of African Business Angel Network, in his A Look At The State Of Angel Investing In Africa argued that it is still early days for angel investing in Africa and admitted that the Capital deployed is marginal. Which is true.
 But, we need to get past launching angel networks and start closing deals as well as establishing solid mentorship programs to help the entrepreneurs.
 According to ABAN, Uganda has 4 angel investment networks; Angels Initiative Uganda, Kampala Angel Investment Network (KAIN), Uganda Business Angels Network (UBAN) and Jamani Ventures. However, some are not active (something David van Dijk admitted), while others  like Angels Initiative  pivoted their business model. In fact, in the past year, you cant point beyond among the active ones.
 This Deal Day will shine a light on Angel Investment not only in Uganda but Africa. However, it shouldnt be the end in itself. There should be tangible results out of it.

"Is the ICT Association of Uganda Relevant?
","The whole idea of having private member associations, like the ICT Association of Uganda, has been approached pretty well over time, with enormous achievements recorded and government guided on policy formulation.
 This has in a way created a better working environment for the private sector as well as given them better bargaining power especially at times when conditions and regulations modelled by the government have been deemed unfair.
 Take Uganda Manufacturers Association (UMA) as a case study. It has united big and upcoming players in the manufacturing industry. And, together, they have negotiated better deals for themselves; including convincing government to provide them land for their plants and reducing costs of production.
 This, they have done through their able leadership. Working with the government to tackle a number of bottlenecks that would hinder their work. Although that notwithstanding, they still have some gaps to fill.
 Another case to consider  although made up of public servants  is the Uganda National Teachers’ Union (UNATU). A body which unites all teachers in the country. Through their Association, teachers have stood up against low pay, inhumane working conditions and other issues that affect them. Although no substantive achievement has been recorded, their influence is felt.
 The same has been realized in the technology sector, geared by the Information Communications Technology Association of Uganda (ICTAU).  Yet, there is more that could be done, if a few things are put in order.
 I may not be the right person to write about ICTAU since despite belonging to the same sector, I had not taken any step to make my membership in the Association official and neither was I actively involved in the Association’s business aside from reporting about their successes and programs.
 But hey, it’s 2018 and among the top things on my to-do list is subscribe fully to the association whose potential is too big although not yet fully realized.
 What has ICTAU done?
 I have to commend the work so far done by the association in advising the government on issues concerning technology. From telecoms, internet and many more. Though, I won’t brag that I know much about ICTAU, their role in the much rejected Simcard registration/verification process was commendable.
 Another credit goes to the association for the efforts made to make sure verification of ICT vendors is not so costly despite the efforts, the requirements and costs are still not so affordable.
 Through their quarterly gatherings (LAN), a number of startup entrepreneurs have been linked to potential funders and mentors and this will (although not fully realised) contribute immensely to the growth of the sector.
 Taking a look at the association’s initial objectives, it’s not so surprising to say that “not much” has been realized and that there is too much room for improvement.
 ICTAU membership fees structure
 Subscription to ICTAU currently is 50,000 for students, 100,000/- for corporate individuals, 1,000,000 for educational institutions and 4,000,000 for government departments.
 Subscription for private companies is classified into three levels, with Level 3 paying 1,000,000/-, level 2 paying 6,000,000/- and level 1 paying 10,000,000/-
 Each subscription package paid annually has specified benefits that are enjoyed by the respective members of the Association.
 That, in my opinion, is not too much to ask, keeping in mind what the association could achieve if it grew stronger. But this can be paid if and when the works of the association are making a change and can be felt.
 Also to note, for an unspecified period of time (as indicated on the association’s website), membership fees have been slashed by 50%
 What is failing ICTAU?
 For any association/body to stand and succeed, it needs members. This is one big cancer that the ICT Association is suffering from and if not treated, will eat the association to the bones. More members of the association mean more funds to run the secretariat and hence building even stronger structures. More members, also mean a bigger voice by the association. One which policymakers won’t give a deaf ear.
 This has however failed as big corporations have decided not to join the association fully but rather sending their employees to join as individual members. They hence cannot bring a bigger (much needed) voice since, in the association, they are not recognized as the corporations they so represent.
 Also read: The ICT Association of Uganda (ICTAU) announces new board of directors
 Associations like UMA have been able to achieve what they have achieved because of the strong voices on their membership, which when they speak, even the President will be compelled to respond.
 The ICTAU has failed to achieve this. And, until big multi-national corporations and bigger telecoms embrace and subscribe to the association, the dream carried by the founders will stay unfulfilled.
 What needs to be done?
 The initial step is to build and boost membership. Not only individual membership but corporations. This, if successfully done, will even attract more individual members and hence build the association both through its respect and footprint.
 All government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) need to subscribe to the association to have their side heard and to also hear from the private players. This should be made mandatory since most, if not all, MDAs currently use ICT services in their day to day works.
 Big institutions like Universities, Telecoms, Innovation hubs, and ICT manufacturers, should be mandated to subscribe to the association if they are to provide any ICT related service in the country.
 ICTAU membership should be given a percentage consideration, say 40%, during the government’s certification process of vendors.
 Also, membership on the board of directors should be limited to individuals that represent bigger corporations so as to amplify the voice of the association.
 Is the Association Relevant?
 It’s not always good to set questions and answer them by yourself. But yes, the association is so much relevant. We have witnessed how gradually Uganda is leaning to ICT to provide almost all services. And, unless there is a private body monitoring the same, the ordinary Ugandan will be reaped to the bone.
 Issues like subsidized internet rates, subsidized taxes on mobile phones can all be spearheaded by such an association but the responsible persons have decided to ignore it. The other painful issue is the fact that the association has been left to only us the geeks, no offence is meant in wording. ICT doesn’t only stop at developing solutions.
 The reason why most ICT products in Uganda have failed to see the light of the day is that there is some lacking strategy in execution. The ICT Association is relevant to both techies and non-techies. Marketers are needed to push the developed products while as social workers are needed to guide developers on the problems affecting the communities in which they work.
 The biologists need to guide developers on which products could help save some situations and all this can be achieved if individuals in the different sectors subscribed to the association.
 The association is relevant to everyone in every sector. And hence, the responsible persons need to stop marketing it as an association for only techies but one for all Ugandans.

"You can now record your phone calls using the Truecaller app
","Caller identification app Truecaller can now support call recording for Android users. This was announced on the app support site. Call recorder is finally here, reads part of the announcement. 
 True Caller said that the feature was built as a response to user demand. Its a feature request which we see every day, they wrote.
 With the new recorder feature, users will be able to record conversations with the unknown callers and the company says that this will help users to curb and “report harassment related or fraudulent calls.”
 The feature is currently available for 14 days free trial to enable one find out if it is supported on their device or not. After that, it will only work when a premium user dials or receives a call.
 Read About: Facebook has finally decided to monetize the Whatsapp Business feature
 Truecaller isnt providing an option for users of the feature to store their recordings to the cloud. The only available option for now is the device one is using  not even the SD-Card. Though these could be around the corner once the feature proves successful.
 Currently, it is only available to devices running Android 5.0 and above. It is clear why TrueCaller is android focused. The company is primarily in emerging markets where android usage dominates.
 However, it wont work for certain phones. This includes all Nexus devices and Pixel devices as well as Android 7.1.1 devices, and Motorola G4. Additionally, the feature wont function if you have any other call recording apps on your phone.
 Call recording is an essential facet of business for parties that want to keep track of voice calls such as interviews or specific instructions from someone.
 That is why this feature is going to be useful for those doing sales or things that require them to make calls on the go. Though True Caller believes that the feature will assist users in “keeping track of important conversation with business and colleagues.”
 Founded in 2009, True Caller sources data from its users and then gives all the people in its network the ability to know who has called them without limit.

"Cash-on-delivery still preferred mode of payment, Jumia Mobile Reports
","Today, Jumia Uganda has released its mobile report ahead of its looming Mobile Week. It joins Kenya and Nigeria also published their mobile reports recently. But, all reports say that cash-on-delivery is still, by far, the most preferred.
 According to the reports; In Uganda, 83% of shoppers prefer to pay cash-on-delivery. Nigeria and Kenya come second and third with 67% and 58%.
 The reports say because “it enables buyers to examine the item they receive before paying for it. If the item is good, the customer pays for it. If the item is not the same thing seen on the website, the customer can reject the item on delivery.”
 Mobile Money is also becoming a preferred mode of payment, especially in the East African countries.
 In Uganda, 16% of the shoppers preferred paying with MTN Mobile Money. The same pattern was noticed in Kenya with 40% of the shoppers using Mobile Money for payments. It should be noted that Jumia Uganda doesn’t accept payments from any other telecom company. Perhaps because MTN is an Investor in Jumia Group.
 But, the second most preferred mode of payment in Nigeria is credit Credit and Debit Cards. With 23% of shoppers using it and only 10% using Mobile Money.
 The reports also confirm the fact that Africa is still a mobile-first continent. With 77% of the shoppers in Uganda using Mobile phones. The same trend is noticed in Kenya and Nigeria with 65% and 79% respectively.
 Also read: Jumia Uganda starts using DHL and Aramex ahead of Mobile Week
 “The mobile-first trend is also prevalent among Jumia Vendors, of whom the majority access their seller accounts through the seller centre app on their mobile phones,” the Ugandan report says.
 The Kenyan report noted that “the shift  although gradual  from Jumia.com to the App is a commendable development, and we hope to see a higher conversion in 2018.”
 Other interesting statistics are devices sold and gender of shoppers.
 Hong Kong-headquartered Transsion Holdings is still the leading phone company in Africa. The company manufactures Tecno, Infinx and Itel brands.
 Across the three Jumia markets, Infinix and Tecno are the leading brands. With Infinix leading in Nigeria and Kenya while Tecno leading in Uganda.
 The average price of a smartphone on Jumia platforms across Africa dropped from 99$ in 2016 to $96. With Uganda having the biggest drop in the three markets. The price dropped from $135 to $83.
 
 “Jumia has seen and welcomed a downward trend in the average price of mobile phones. from 167 USD in 2015 to 83 USD at present. The penetration of largely low-cost Internet enabled handheld deuces by a variety of brands has contnbuted [sic] to this shat [sic]. Uganda has embraced Asian brands hke [sic] Tecno. Infinx and For who have further contributed to smartphone democratization. A new smartphone brand, Slml, has gale as far as setting its smartphone price pant at under 100.000 UGX,” the report noted.
 
 Lastly, Men are shopping more than the women across all the three markets. For example, in Uganda, 68% of the shoppers on the platform are male. The number is 65% and 63% for Kenya and Nigeria respectively.
 “Predictably. Jumla attracted more male shoppers than female shoppers in 2017  which can be explained by the fact that, in Uganda, more men own mobile phones that [sic] women. This means that women represent the vast majority of the untapped mobile market. On Jumia, a majority of orders are delivered to men (68%), while women represent 32% of the overall deliveries made,” the Uganda report says.

"Rwanda&#8217;s Sobek and Khenz enter ticket advertising partnership
","Sobek Communications, an advertising and communication company, and Khenz  a provider of software and POS systems to the public transportation industry  have entered a partnership. This will see both Kigali-based companies offer a more targeted way of advertising to travellers in Rwanda.
 With Khenz supplying the machines, Sobek Communications can now offer advertisers a range of packages to advertise on the back of tickets, wrote Sean Obedih Ndiho, founder and CEO of Sobek.
 According to Sean, the partnership will enable brands to reach over 1M people per month. That is through placing their messages directly in people’s hands.
 Currently, the partnership  which is based on revenue share  is in a pilot phase. Though, the ultimate goal is rolling it out to the whole of Rwanda. Our aim is to cover Rwanda as a whole before moving to other countries, Sean pointed out.
 The market has incumbents, but Sobek sees itself as a better alternative. Especially when it comes to pricing. Additionally, the company says that it can measure the reach of their campaigns.
 This new partnership allows us to measure and track the effectiveness of our client’s campaigns, Sobek wrote, and offer brands a unique opportunity to reach their audiences at an affordable price of as little as 99.99 RWF.

 Adding that potential collaborations will be explored as the Company scales.
 The IFC website lists Kobo360 co-founders as the project sponsors. The Project sponsors are Obiora Ozor (Chief Executive Officer/Co-Founder) and Ifeoluwa Oyedele II (Chief Technology Officer/Co-Founder).
 Adding that the two Project sponsors are also the majority shareholders of the Company.

"Why the Ugandan Startup Ecosystem should copy the betting Industry
","This evening (21/04/2017), i went to meetup with Ivan Mworozi, Co-founder of Akiba, at Outbox Hub. This highly anticipated meeting has been pending for a while ever since Ivan returned from Geneva where he had gone to represent Akiba and Uganda at the Seedstars World Summit the winners of the 2016 Seedstars Kampala edition.
 The main intention was to feature Akiba in the follow-up section of SDA. This is a section where we get startups and contributors to the Ugandan startup ecosystem to account for any hand or help theyve had in the past. So this was Akibas time to!

 — SDA (@DigestAfrica) April 5, 2017
 
 As we started talking, the conversation slowly drifted away from Akiba to the fintech climate in Uganda  a story of its own  and later the entire Ugandan startup ecosystem, which i am to focus on. First of all, we dont have an ecosystem  if its there, then its at conception stage.
 Startups in Uganda operate under some of the harshest environments in the world. This means running a startup in this country isnt for the fainthearted. Even the mightiest have fallen off the wagon. I mean we have all heard those stories of what seemed like a successful startup founder abandoning their startup and instead decide to take up a corporate job.
 They are not to blame in most cases, because the fire is too hot in entrepreneurship. Its even hotter for those who are in it for short term success or the limelight.
 You see, being an entrepreneur in Uganda is already hard yet our families and friends wont also let it be any easier. We are in a society that is accustomed to fast results in everything we do. I mean just look at how people drive  everyone wants to be ahead of the one ahead of them in the traffic jam.
 Yet this is different when it comes to entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship in itself represents patience and discipline. But take a good look around you, a keen look. Most of the people are struggling to pay off bills, loans, looking for a job or something related to that. This has created a sense of urgency in everything we do. Everyone needs the money now or the bank takes their car, they need the money now else they wont eat lunch, they need the money now else they wont be able to go for the job interview.
 So when one decides to become an entrepreneur, then they are not normal. Theyre not fitting into the society of urgency anymore. They are no-longer cool simply because theyre willing to bet today for a better tomorrow.
 Thats when those annoying questions, mostly of ridicule, start coming up when you arrive at parties where former classmates or family members are driving or have something better like a plot of land to show off. In fact, very few will try to understand when you tell them that youre working on something thatll bring in money 5-10 years from today. All theyre interested in hearing about is what you have on-ground.
 But, honestly, you can not blame such people. Probably if we were in their shoes we would think the same. Plus, no one likes associating with failures. Thats why a person who has a boda boda bringing in UGX. 15,000 per day will have a bigger say in such conversations compared to a startup founder whose idea/product might scale across the continent in the 5 or more years theyre not sure about. The reason is simple, the other guy who owns a boda boda has something to make reference to.
 So, as a startup founder in Uganda, what do you reference to? We need success stories, something that can make people shut up. They say, nothing shuts people up more than success.
 Ugandan Youths checking out results at one of the betting Centers in Kampala
 You know why youths in Sub-saharan Africa spend most of their time on betting? Because there are success stories to reference to. At least i have witnessed someone win UGX 65,000,000 in betting  just three years ago. But i havent witnessed a  Ugandan startup founder sell it for anything close to that.
 Do we ever ask ourselves why youths keep going back to betting? Because they have seen results. They have seen their peers win millions but have never seen anyone they know sell their startup or scale it across the continent. The closest they come to seeing entrepreneurs or startup founders get money is the stories they read online of people over 10,000 miles away in Silicon Valley, Berlin, London, Israel and many more.
 All theyre used to when it comes to Uganda is someone being featured on BBC, CNN or NTV as a promising young entrepreneur and then a few years down the road both the entrepreneur and their product can never be traced.
 How do we expect people to trust us with their money or any form of support when there is no history of success at all? We badly need something to show off whenever someone pauses such a question. Just imagine you woke up and the headline for the Daily Monitor or New Vision is Ugandan startup founder makes $10,000,000 after buy out. How many people will be now excited to tap into the next startup to be bought?
 This will make people pay attention! People will then listen when someone pitched to them an idea, parents will pay attention when their kids told them their desire to become entrepreneurs. I know i am asking for a lot from the entrepreneurs, because i know youre already giving in a lot despite the conditions under which youre operating, but thats the reason you chose this path.
 As an upcoming ecosystem, we now have an obligation of pulling our time, money, expertise and each and every resource we can to ensure we at least register a success story. I care dont who it will be, but we badly need it to shut up all the naysayers. Because you know what they say, SUCCESS SHUTS UP THE CRITICS. Until then, we should put up with the ridicule and anything all those outside the entrepreneurship sphere have to say.

"PRESS RELEASE: RENEW, an impact investment firm, expands to Uganda
","RENEW, an impact investment firm has announced entry into Uganda, making it their second market in Africa after Ethiopia.
 The partners of RENEW recently traveled to Kampala, Uganda to hold preliminary meetings with promising companies, explore potential office sites, RENEW wrote in a press release.
 The firm registered a local entity called RENEW Investments Uganda LTD and also hired their first employee in Uganda.
 RENEW has been considering launching in Uganda for a long time. Members of the RENEW team first traveled to Uganda in 2006 and have been observing the country ever since. Despite the country having many drawbacks, the firm says that a couple of factors attracted them.
 Also read: Taxido is the latest to join Africa’s ride-hailing space
 Several factors make it an attractive destination for RENEW and the Impact Angel Network, including a growing population (currently estimated at 40 million), a rising middle class with a per capita GDP of $2,400, a government-oriented towards private sector growth and a legal system mainly based in English common law.
 “Uganda has performed very well over the past ten years. The country also has a special place in RENEW’s history, as it was the first country I visited on the continent and learned about the immense opportunity in Sub-Saharan Africa’s private sector. We are excited that RENEW and the Impact Angel Network (IAN) are expanding from Ethiopia, where we have become the most active investment firm, into Uganda; a country rich with culture and opportunity,” RENEW’s CEO Matthew Davis recently commented.
 RENEW has brought on Mary Adoi, as Legal Counsel. Mary comes to RENEW from Barry Investments Ltd, a commodity trading company operating in Northern Uganda, where she offered legal advisory services to the firm. Mary holds a bachelor’s degree from Makerere University Kampala and a post-graduate diploma from the Law Development Centre.
 RENEW has been a presence in Ethiopia since 2012 and, with the IAN, has become one of the most active private equity investors in the country and plans to bring this full model to Uganda. RENEW is an impact investment firm that has designed an innovative financing model to address the missing middle that exists in the capital markets across many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 The missing middle is a gap in the capital markets that exists between microfinance and larger equity funds and bank financing. The missing middle limits the development of the private sector, specifically for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). RENEWs model fills this gap by investing capital alongside the IAN, a global network of impact investors. RENEW established the IAN in 2012, and it has now grown to become the largest angel network in North America dedicated to investing in SMEs in Africa.
 RENEW and the IAN partnered with the development community to build vibrant angel investment ecosystems that provide risk capital for SMEs, unlocking their potential for job creation and financial returns.

"Uganda&#8217;s SafeBoda nolonger Safe, Taxify going after it.
","UPDATE:
 On February 9, 2018, Taxify officially announced that theyre now allowing their riders to book boda bodas on their platform. Putting them in direct competition with SafeBoda.
 ORIGINAL STORY
 While as we witnessed flooding in Ugandas ride-hailing industry  for cars, SafeBoda remained safe in its boda-boda (motorcycle) category. However, the latest entrant in the market- Taxify, has decided to have a piece of that cake  too.
 According to our sources, Taxify has started on-boarding boda-boda riders to its platform. The Estonian ride-hailing company with its Ugandan offices located in Bugolobi is the latest to become innovative and diversify its revenue streams as well as widen its scope of services.
 Kampala is one of the most notorious cities when it comes to the traffic jam. According to Kampala Capital City Authority, the city was designed to cope with about 45,000 vehicles, yet those that enter the city daily are more than two million, including taxis and private vehicles.
 Thats what led to the rise of the boda-boda and eventually SafeBoda.
 In fact, during peak traffic and working hours, many prefer to jump onto a boda-boda other than drive or use the public means. Mainly because of its convenience.
 This had reduced the car ride-hailing companies to being used in the night, going to events or the weekend when traffic is a little bit relaxed.
 Taxify moving into this area implies the company is looking to offer a 360 degrees service  come rain, sunshine, darkness or traffic jam. Which is, with all due respect, something incredible.
 In an effort to find out Taxifys position on this, we reached out to the person in charge of their public relations in Uganda over the weekend. However, he said that he was ignorant about the matter since he has been out of office on leave. Instead, he referred us to Lorreen Ajiambo, the Head of PR who sits in Kenya.
 She declined to take our calls nor reply to our messages over the weekend. And, this morning [22/01/2018], she did pick our call but refused to comment saying she will get back to us later.
 By the time of publication of this story [10.30am EAT] Taxifys offices in Uganda on Spring road Bugolobi were still closed and therefore, we were unable to get a comment from them.
 However, all the sources we spoke to are figures highly respected in the Ugandan startup ecosystem.
 If Taxify is able to prove that the model works, given that Uber might pull out of the market, then they are likely to dominate the African ride-hailing market. Because I dont think itll be hard for them to replicate the same in Kenya and Nigeria.
 If thats not the case, then there will be a rise of copy and paste amongst its competitors. Whoever will be aggressive the most, will remain the last man standing.
 Although, all this is happening as SafeBoda is expanding to Kenya. (See also: Uganda’s SafeBoda expanding to Kenya).
 Currently, the ride-hailing market in Uganda has Uber, Taxify, Quick Taxi, Friendship Taxi, Spesho and SafeBoda. Though I wont be surprised if Safaricoms Little launched before 2018 ends.

"Shumuk Group CEO Indicates Locals Are not Ready to Invest in Ugandan Startups
","On Wednesday, Kafeero Foundation launched Ugandas first online Startup Studio called The Innovation Junction at their offices in Muyenga  broadcasted live on facebook and their live TV website kafeero.tv.
 The event hosted Mukesh Shuklah, the CEO of Shumuk Group, who narrated his business experience in Uganda and how the East African community is making the manufacturing sector in the country an endangered species.
 He gave advice to the young people who dominated the audience estimated at just above 30. Although his advice was targeted to an audience of young people starting up, it is safe to say that if one is involved or plans to venture into manufacturing, they benefitted more.
 Nonetheless, he made an effort to tackle the pain points of starting out a business in Uganda. One of them  that he briefly hinted on  was getting access to capital (both venture and angel capital).
 He pointed out that the Shumuk foundation is looking, and happy, to partner with organizations and people supporting young entreprenuers to access venture and angel capital.
 
 If you come with the proposals, we can really talk in terms of money as well as promoting the youngster. And, once we like the idea, we keep pushing until it succeeds. So, we are thinking in that line but you only have to join hands and see how to put it into practice, Mukesh said
 
 This was interesting and prompted me  during the Q&amp;A session  to ask a question seeking clarity on the same issue.
 My question was seeking to understand how startup founders in Uganda can stop looking at external capital and investment  and instead look within. This was partyly because, as black people, it is simply hard to raise external funding.
 He agreed that people with money find it hard to trust you when youre starting out.
 According to me, there are more people in this world with a lot of money and dont know what to do with the money. The problem is that 90% of those people who have the money can not trust you, Mukesh said.
 Yet, if were to go by his example, it indicates that even people that have money locally dont trust either local startup founders or arent willing to take a risk at all. In otherwords, theyre trying to shield themselves.
 For lack of a better word  basing on his answer to my question, i think theres no difference between what he is planning to do to help startup founders and what the banks, as well as money lenders, are currently doing. Which is ask for the impossible before you can give them the capital or investment.
 Theyre only willing to make an investment where their return is guaranteed. Which is not the case with startups. The proposed financing conditions suit a fully established business looking for funds for expansion or to produxe products to meet growing demand. Most startups are actually in dire need of risk capital  something the investor is ready to write off.
 Today, if i tell you that i have $100,000 can you manage? Tell me what you can do. After one year, it is not easy to give someone back $110,000. If you prove the capacity, money will flow to you, Mukesh said.
 Though, at the end of his answer to my question, he acknowledged that he doesnt have the perfect answer to the problem on the table.
 I am sure theres no perfect answer to this question, but i have tried, Mukesh concluded.
 This is quite understandable, given that he had never visited any innovation hub or incubation centre in the country. In fact, before visiting the Innovation junction at Kafeero foundation, he had no idea we had such destinations in the country.
 
 I used to see these things in other countries and ask myself, why dont we have them in Uganda? Mukesh said.
 
 Yet, we have had Innovation hubs in the country for the past five years. Though the list has changed as some have opened and closed, Hive Colab and Outbox have remained intact. And, recently, the Innovation Village in Ntinda, Design Hub in Industrial area and Kafeero Foundations Innovation Junction in Muyenga have joined the list.
 The ignorance on Mukeshs part should be a very big concern. Yet, we can not blame him, but the people and organizatiosn that have mandated themselves to support startups in Uganda. You simply can not work in isolation.
 Like the age old African adage goes, it takes a village to raise a child  it takes an ecosystem to raise self sustaining startups. Hence the need to keep the corporate sector close.
 One of the reasons being that they have some disposable income that they can easily inject into the startups if courted as angel investors. Secondly, theyve got the expertise and experience still lacking in the startup founders.

"Mali&#8217;s first bike-hailing startup has the backing of Toyota&#8217;s Africa subsidiary
","The sharing economy, enabled by technology, has disrupted transportation across the globe. But, the sharing economy is not new in Africa. If anything, it is an integral part of most African communities. It is, thus, not surprising that the pioneers of ride-hailing, Zim Ride, drew inspiration from Zimbabwe.
 Yet, Africas ride-sharing economy is still disorganized and inefficient. Take an example of Matatus in Nairobi. But, this is beginning to change as technology takes centre stage.
 Many innovators, entrepreneurs and corporates have developed solutions to address this challenge. Drawing their inspiration from an industry popularized by Uber.
 In Kenya, Safaricom launched Little Cabs and Econet launched Vaya Rides in Zimbabwe taking on the cab industry. While SafeMotos, Gokada and SafeBoda are taking on the boda-boda industry in Rwanda, Nigeria and Uganda. Egypts, Swvl is taking on public transportation vans. Something Uber is pondering to do in Kenya, with the Matatus.
 Against this backdrop of successful ride-sharing solutions across the continent, the World Bank and CFAO Automotive  the subsidiary of Toyota in Africa  joined forces to launch Malis first bike-hailing startup, Teliman.
 In Malis capital, Bamako, the population sits at 2.3 million and growing rapidly  at 5%. As a result, the countrys road network is coming under increased pressure. Especially when it comes to public transportation. Prompting the need for a solution.
 The World Bank says, traditional taxis are too expensive for the average commuter. While alternative options are uncomfortable and slow. This results in overflowing with people on Bamako’s roads. Using bikes makes the commute 5 times faster than Sotrama (vans) and 4 times cheaper than taxis.
 Launched in May 2018, Teliman is the brainchild of a World Bank-sponsored hackathon. The hackathons aim was to facilitate open innovation between local start-ups and CFAO.
 
 “This wasn’t an idea being imposed from the outside: it was a homegrown solution to a problem identified in the local market,” Abdoulaye Maiga, CTO of Teliman.
 
 Thomas Gajan, Chief Innovation and Development Officer for CFAO Automotive concurred. Adding that he sees the project as a response to social challenges in Mali. In the end, creating employment for the youth and stemming the tide of migration to Europe from the region.
 Teliman launched its first drivers’ cohort early this year, as a prototype to show that the model is profitable and safe. Not only to customers but also to future drivers. The company projected that by December 2018, a fleet of as many as 100 drivers could be on the road. With another 1,200 planned by the end of 2019.
 To date, the startup has secured at least $700,000 in funding which came from CFAO Automotive. As well as a group of local angel investors.
 But, Teliman isnt CFAOs first bet on the continent. The company has before invested in Kenyas logistics startup, Sendy. They will thus be looking to share lessons learned across the board. Seeing that logistics and ride-hailing are not very far from each other.

"LifeBank launches Airbank, an emergency oxygen delivery service
","According to The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, in 2017, Nigeria had the 6th highest child mortality rate. That is 100 deaths per 1,000 live births.
 This implies that the chances of a Nigerian child dying before their 5th birthday are 1 in 10. A ratio that’s approximately 21 times the average of developed countries.
 Among the causes, in countries with struggling health systems, includes preventable diseases. Diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia.
 Pneumonia, an infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs and limits oxygen intake, is the highest killer of Nigerian children under 5.
 Against this backdrop, Nigerias LifeBank  a medical distribution startup  launched Airbank. An on-demand emergency oxygen delivery service. The startup believes that with the service, they will reduce Nigeria’s child mortality rate caused by limited access to oxygen.
 Also read: mPharma launches initiative to save collapsing pharmacies
 The process is simple. A hospital makes a call to LifeBank requesting for emergency medical oxygen. 50 minutes later, the startup makes the delivery.
 LifeBank says that improved access to oxygen can reduce childhood pneumonia fatalities by 35%. In Nigeria where about 177,000 children die annually from pneumonia, at least 61,950 children can be saved annually by making oxygen readily available.
 Before adding oxygen delivery, the startup had been working on the blood shortage problem in Nigeria. By connecting hospitals to blood banks, and blood banks to donors.
 
 We connect donors through mobile infrastructure and built a discovery platform where hospitals can request the blood they need.
 
 They deliver the blood requested in less than 45 minutes, in a WHO Blood Transfusion Safety compliant cold chain.
 Founded in 2015 by Temie Giwa Tubosun, the startup has raised at least $225,000 in funding to date. At the beginning of this year, they announced a $200,000 seed round for an 18 months runway.
 Investors in the round included EchoVC Partners, a Lagos-based venture capital firm. Fola Laoye, an angel investor with over 20 years of experience in Nigeria’s healthcare industry also participated.

"China&#8217;s Ant Financial is slowly but seriously entering Africa&#8217;s payments space
","Ant Finacial, formerly known as Alipay and an affiliate of Alibaba Group, is slowly but seriously entering the African payments space. This conclusion can be reached by looking at the payments companys actions in the recent past.
 Last week [03/08/2018], Ant Financials CEO, Eric Jing, was in Ethiopia meeting with other executives from IFC as well as the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa  ECA.
 Also read: Here is all you need to know about Jack Ma’s $10 Million Netpreneur prize
 Eric met with ECA Executive Secretary, Vera Songwe, who led him and IFC’s VP and Treasurer, Jingdong Hua, to a meeting with President Mulatu Teshome of Ethiopia. The meeting, according to the details from a press release was about using IT for inclusion purposes.
 Addressing a group of journalists right after the meeting, Ms. Songwe said Essentially, we were talking (with the president) about IT and the power of IT for financial, social and political inclusion, the press release noted.
 The conversation looks to have surrounded supporting financial SMEs  especially those in payments  considering both IFC and Ant Financial were at the center of the meeting. ECA hopes that forging such partnerships will help SMEs take full benefits of the recently signed AfCTA.
 Agenda 2030 and Agenda 2063 say we should leave no one behind, and many people have been asking what happens to SMEs with the AfCFTA. So we are thinking about what platforms we can put together to ensure that not only big companies take advantage of the AFCTA but also small companies, the Executive Secretary of ECA noted.
 Ms. Songwe also added that Africa now has “an opportunity to leapfrog technology for social, financial and political inclusion. Adding that they are bringing Ant Financial, which has the largest platform for financial inclusion and assists people with very small financial capacity to be involved in the society.”
 Before, Ant Financial has flirted with the African continent by launching its services in select parts of the African continent.

 Mid last year, the company extended its payments service  Alipay to South Africa making it the first African country it supported. The service was launched in South Africa with the intention of servicing Chinese tourists according to CNBC.
 Rita Liu, head of Alipay EMEA, told CNBC at that time that they would work with tour bus operator City Sightseeing, to enable Chinese tourists to purchase tourists more conveniently from City Sightseeing buses. She also added that they saw big potential in Africa.
 On his first visit to Africa, last year, Jack Ma also hinted at the fact that Alipay was going to launch in Kenya. A year later, in June this year, TechWeez reported that soon Kenyan businesses will be able to accept Alipay and WeChat payments.
 That was thanks to a partnership between Equitel (Finserve Limited) and Red Dot Payment Limited. Again, in all this, the target is the Chinese tourist or expatriate community in the country seeing that Equitel released a Mandarin version of their EazzyBanking app.
 In his speech, in Johannesburg a few days ago, Jack Ma himself pointed out the challenges facing Africans and payments was top of his radar. He put this together with tourism and logistics.
 Ma could be looking at Africa as a powerful tourist destination for Chinese and thus wants to position his company to take advantage of that.
 Ant Financial recently closed a $14 Billion round of funding valuing the payments giant at $150 Billion. A figure that makes it more valuable than Goldman Sachs, the American multinational investment bank, and financial services company.

"Kampala Angel Investors Network deal day is, finally, set for October
","Kampala Angel Investors Network  KAIN  has announced that its deal day is slated for October 4, 2018.
 The event will see 10 startups pitch to an audience of angel investors in a closed room. These were shortlisted from a pool of 50 applications that were submitted earlier in the year.
 Kawanguzi Japheth, the founder of The Innovation Village and one of the leaders at KAIN, said that the investors in their portfolio can write ticket sizes ranging from at least $10,000. We are looking at between 10,000 to 300,000, he said.
 Though, he believes that the investors also bring extra benefits to the startups which could be equal to the funding itself.
 The most important thing we are looking at is not the ticket size, he said. Adding that they are rather looking at the mentorship and the social capital that the investor brings.
 Currently, KAIN has 30 investors signed up so far. Though, only a few have paid the subscription fee according to Japheth. He says that they havent focused on the payment of the subscription because the current aim is building the network.
 The plan is to make sure we are putting on the table high-quality entrepreneurs that are reflective of the sectors that the angels want to invest in, Japheth said.
 Out of the 30 investors, only 15 are active. Also important to note is that only 10, out of the 15, are expected to attend the deal day in October.
 Also read: South Africa’s Yoco raises $16M Series B led by Partech
 But, KAIN is planning to use the same event to lure other local investors who may have not signed up yet. We have an open invitation to especially local potential investors, Japheth said. So we are now trying to aggressively interest other potential local investors for the deal day.
 Another interesting thing is that out of the 30 investors signed up with KAIN, about 40% of them are foreigners. What is even more interesting is that these approach the angel network themselves.
 Although they are open to foreigners, Japheth says that their main focus is on cultivating a culture of local investors. Yet, he admits that this is not an easy task.
 Most of the 60% who are local have been [as a result of] conversations with people and trying to interest them in that opportunity, he said.
 The event was earlier on supposed to take place in April this year but was shelved because of a couple of reasons. We have to spend a lot of time and resources on awareness before we are ready to hit the ground running, Kawanguzi Japheth commented about the delay.

"Is Kampala Angel Investors Network the solution to local startups&#8217; funding problem?
","One of the biggest challenges faced by startups in Africa is funding. This is very evident for Ugandan startups where only a handful have been able to raise funding to finance their future. Most barely try to exist living off the scraps directors can spare from their full time jobs. It seems there isnt enough money. Perhaps we are not looking in the right places.
 There are a couple of avenues for a startup to raise funding but this is hinged on what stage they are at or how much they require. Early stage startups may not nearly as much as their counterparts at the growth stage which you may call scale-ups.
 In Uganda, majority of startups get their funding from grants or winning competitions. Not many have explored or considered other forms of funding. One of them is angel investment.
 According to Investopedia, an Angel Investor invests in small startups or entrepreneurs. Often, angel investors are among an entrepreneurs family and friends. The capital angel investors provide may be a one-time investment to help propel the business forward or an ongoing injection of money to support and carry the company through its difficult early stages.
 It is worth noting though that angel investing is classified as equity finance which means the investor takes shares (an agreed equity stake) in your business in return for providing funds to run the business. In doing this, they seek to not only provide your business with money it needs to grow but also bring their experience and knowledge to help your company achieve success. They can invest alone or as a group.
 We spoke to Kenneth Legesi, from Kampala Angel Investors Network (KAIN). Kenneth has worked in various capacities across management, consulting, corporate and project finance, research, analysis and academia in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Hes also a tutor at the Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) program where he shares Knowledge on investment management and analysis.
 KAIN is one of the flagship programmes under the Innovation Village. And it is a testament to CK Japheths (Founder The Innovation Village) dream of creating an ecosystem  not just a hub. The main aim is to get Ugandans and Africans to pull resources together and develop a culture of investing in their own.
 Angel investment in its own right is a new concept to the African continent but even newer to Uganda. Other countries already have Angel Networks in place, though not operating at the same level as Keiretsu Forum  the worlds largest Angel Investor Network  but theyre fast catching up. Take an example of Lagos Angel Network (LAN), Ghana Angel Investors Network (GAIN) etc.
 KAIN is in its early stages of formulation and according to Japheth, theyre determined to take things one step at a time. The first thing theyre doing is building capacity. They have kicked off with education series for both startup owners as well as those interested in becoming Angels. The series, according to Legesi, will equip aspiring Angels with the necessary skills.

 Asked what theyre doing to ensure Uganda is at par with its peers around the continent, both Legesi and Japheth confirmed that they are keeping a close relationship with an Angel Network in Kenya as well as African Business Angel Network (ABAN). Keeping ABAN close is very vital for not only KAIN but the entire Ugandan startup eco-system, because its main goal is to aid all Angel Networks across the continent.
 On what startups should do to ensure theyre ready to tap into the Angels that might arise, Legesi advised that they enroll for their education series to get acquainted with all the necessary information. To walk the talk, Kenneth has vested interests in several Ugandan startups including Xente, Amari Couriers and many more. These he bets his money on as well as offering his expertise.
 Legesi also confirmed that the Angels wont only be bringing funds on board but their expertise too. This is something very crucial for Ugandan startups as only a few get the chance of having professional mentorship. KAIN will be looking at early stage startups that do not need much in terms of funding. This means that, as an ecosystem that is just being built, we shall need Venture Capitalists as well as Angel investors with the capacity to invest in startups at growth stage.
 We would also like to challenge KAIN to establish networks not only across the African continent but as far as Silicon Valley and beyond because capacity building is one of the things we need as an ecosystem.
 It is not a question of whether Angel Investment is the way to go, the question is when will Ugandans pick interest in this? KAIN may not be where we want it to be right now but we are sure it will be a much needed blessing to local startups.

"Interview: MamaOpe &#8211; Inside BBC Listed African Invention to Look out for 2017
","Last week, Turyabagye Brians innovation, MamaOpe  a Pneumonia diagnosis kit, won the pitch@palace competition in the UK. This was on the back of the startup being named among five African inventions to look out for in 2017 by BBC.
 We thought it wise to get in touch with Brian to get a better understanding of MamaOpe, his team, future plans and his views about the Ugandan startup ecosystem. Brian is quite an interesting and informed fellow.
 
 We finally had a Skype which later became a phone interview with @4cBrial from @mama_ope. #StartupDigestAfrica

 Here is the conversation that he had with our Team Leader, Malinz. Enjoy the reading!
 Q:Tell me about MamaOPe in 2–5 words? 
 A Pneumonia diagnosis kit.
 Q: Why is now the time for MamaOpe to exist?
 We noticed a worrying trend in the mortality rates which prompted us to design a solution that can offer hope to our mother, by saving millions of African children from avoidable deaths caused by Pneumonia.
 Q: At the moment, how do you measure success? What are your metrics? And how far have you gone in achieving them?
 We are currently measuring our success by the sustainability and the number of strong partnerships (that will convert into bookings for the kit) i.e. eventual customers.
 We have so far managed to make partnerships with international health based organisations that are committed to buying this kit and have it distributed in most remote communities where they have strong presence.
 And the quality of the team working on this is very strong with proven records of achieving the set milestones for this project, which is an assurance that we will hit the market with a perfect product in the set timelines.
 Q: Talking about International Organizations, does that mean those are your main target market?
 Yes.The reason we are targeting them is that theyre already doing community work/projects across several African countries. Therefore engaging them will easily create impact for us across other African countries. But still, we are looking at pharmacies as private partners.
 Q: So this is a re-usable Kit?
 Yes, definitely. The way we design the material it can be easily wiped.

 Q: Hasnt anyone around the world come up with a similar idea?
 Not one that i know of. But of course as time goes, competition comes up. People will try to come up with something similar.
 Q: Which country in Africa has the highest rates that youd like to tap in first?
 Tanzania, Nigeria and Niger. Theyre one of the top 10 in the world. Actually out of the top 10 countries in the world, Africa has 7. The prevalence rate is very high in Africa and South America.
 Q: In a few sentences, what do you offer to whom? And who else is trying to do it? Why do you think youre better?
 We are designing a bio-medical smart jacket that aids in fast diagnosis and monitoring of child Pneumonia patients. This can be used in remote health centres, families, clinics and hospitals at large.
 Currently health workers use an ARI timer from UNICEF. This is a good tool to use to diagnose the disease but the manual operation mechanism associated with it doesn’t considerably reduce the time spent in diagnosing the disease.
 For health centres with big numbers, a health worker can easily confuse the counts from this device which increases the margin for human error.Q
 Q: What’s most exciting about your traction/successes to date?
 The most exciting thing has been the great support we have obtained from the global communities in regard to developing this solution.
 We have been able to get various partners willing to assist in one way or the other just to ensure that this solution comes to the market to save another generation of our children.

 Q: Where do you think your biggest growth will be next year?
 Our biggest growth will be on fine tuning our product for larger communities and ensuring that indeed serves the current pressing need of mis-diagnosis.
 Q: Do you have any paying customers? If yes, tell me about your first paying customer and revenue expectations over the next year.
 Our solution is not yet market-ready but is undergoing the necessary approved steps to prepare it for the market.
 Q: All startups have threats, what is your biggest threat?
 In healthcare, the regulatory hurdles and sales cycles can take significant time and the resistance to change is high, so the entire cycle is elongated. Theres an intense amount of patience needed to be an entrepreneur in general, and in health care even more so.
 Q: How are you funding MamaOpe? How do you see it funded in a years time?
 In the previous year, our project won in the Big Ideas competition (by UC Berkeley, California) and the prize money has been of great help to carry us through the design iterations on top of our personal contributions to see this come to reality.
 We are currently seeking for a grant and/or investment support that will get us through the approval steps so that this solution gets on market.
 Q: Weve seen startups win competitions and thats it. Is this the same case with MamaOpe?
 We are driven by our deep passion to save many more lives and leave an impact to our communities with better solutions.
 We cannot simply be blinded by small breakthroughs such as winning competitions, these simply help to affirm to us that what we are doing is on track and the job to us is to put in our best minds to bring the solutions as a reward for the support that we get.
 Q: How many people are on your team?
 We started out as 3 people but as per now we are upto six people. We have two medical researchers, another engineer who gives us over sight plus another medical person who gives guidance.
 Q: Where are your offices located.
 Theres an office we opened up around Makerere that we are currently occupying
 Q: Have you had any support from other hospitals, medical instituitions or ministry of health?
 We havent yet actively sought for their help so i cant say they have or not been helpful. At our stage of operation, we havent yet needed. But when reach the stage of clinical trials, we shall be able to hit them up.

"Startup Profile: Intership &#8211; ship your goods to Uganda without a hustle
","What Intership?
 Intership is Uganda’s first package forwarding and online logistics service, unlocking US, UK &amp; China markets for consumer goods to SMEs and online shoppers.
 Solution?
 Intership provides a shipping address and warehousing in the US, UK and China for those interested in having their good shipped to Uganda. They repack and consolidate items for customer to help them reduce on costs and also provide familiar payment options like Mobile Money, Cash as well as Local Debit Cards for their customers who want to buy online.
 So far they have made it easy for thousands of relatives in the Diaspora to send items to their loved ones back home by providing convenient and affordable shipping and allowing them to pay directly using Paypal.
 Funding and Incubation
 The intership team started out with own savings which you can classify as Personal Investment or as commonly referred to  boostrapping. The startup is currently incubated at Outbox Hub located on Soliz House, Lumumba Avenue.
 Successes
 The Intership team has quite a number of successes on their back. In 2015, they won Seedstars Kampala beating SafeBoda and Wizarts Media which came in as first and second runners-up respectively. This year, 2017, they were chosen by MyAfricanStartUp among the top 100 African startups to invest in.
 According to Nielsimms Sangho, the CEO of Intership, they have so far shipped 7000 orders ever since they began executing and have seen the orders doubling month on month (MoM).
 Challenges
 The Intership team cites insufficient long term capital to finance their working capital as well as the receivables from corporate clients who pay upon delivery. They further single out the high taxation and compliance fees that chock the growth of small businesses.
 Lastly, the low local investing culture affects the startup(s). This is because foreign investors anywhere in the world can only have faith in a product/startup only if the locals have faith in it.
 My thoughts
 Intership is one of the few startups we have in the country that are satisfying a real need. But just as they highlighted out in their challenges, however much theyre satisfying a need, as long as they have no funding to finance their working capital, theyll go down the drain just like all the promising startups that weve had in the country.
 My verdict; It is a great startup with a bright future but needs local support  just like most of the startups we have.

"Kenya&#8217;s Twiga Foods Raises $10.3 Million in Series A Round
","Kenyan B2B food supply platform, Twiga Foods, successfully raised a Series A funding amounting to USD 10.3 Million in a round led by Wamda Capital. Other investors in the round included Omidyar Network, DOB Equity, Uqalo, 1776, Blue Haven Initiative, Alpha Mundi, and AHL. The funding was broken down to $6.3 Million in equity and an additional $4m in debt.
 The investment is aimed at enabling the company increase its number of vendors to be able to serve each day in Nairobi, diversify its product portfolio, and introduce advanced supplier services. This will help them further their ambition of becoming the largest grocer in Africa minus opening up a store.
 Twiga Foods was established in 2014, with the aim of improving Kenya’s agricultural market as well as helping address key economic issues including soaring food prices, safety, and sustainable markets.
 This is the fourth round Twiga foods is raising after previously raising $1 Million convertible note in February 2016, an undisclosed amount in December 2017 and a $2 Million grant from USAID and GSMA in July this year.
 
 Twiga is an outcome of the Nairobi startup ecosystem, the years of investments that have gone into developing talent, supporting hubs, and attracting capital to the market, said Grant Brooke, co-founder of Twiga Foods.
 
 The company uses technology to consolidate the fragmented purchasing power of urban retailers. It saves them a trip to the market by delivering to their doorstep better quality and better-priced stock.
 Twiga then translates this aggregated purchasing power to farmers across the country allowing them to access stable markets at better prices while minimizing post-harvest losses through efficient logistics.
 Today, Twiga is the largest distributor of several basic food staples in Kenya, having sold over 55 million bananas alone and delivering over 4,000 orders a week.
 The Series A funding round also signals increased momentum for Nairobi’s growing tech industry.
 Fadi Ghandour, chairman of Wamda Capital, who will be joining the Twiga Board of Directors said:
 
 Twiga represents our first investment in East Africa, a new geography for us in which we plan on being increasingly more active. We are particularly excited about beginning our investment program in East Africa by supporting this remarkable set of entrepreneurs building a truly disruptive business. Drawing on our experience in the logistics and supply chain space, we believe Twiga has developed a unique solution to address the inherent inefficiencies in the delivery of fresh produce in East Africa with significant positive impact for both producers and consumers
 
 “We are pleased to support Twiga and its mission of helping Kenya create a more sustainable, scalable farm produce ecosystem,” said Ory Okolloh, director of investments at Omidyar Network.
 Additional to the Series A round closing, Twiga closed some $2 million in grant funding from USAID, GSMA, and others to support bolt-on farmer services, financial inclusion, and first of their kind domestic food safety initiatives.
 The addition of new partners into Twiga, and continued support of our current stakeholders, is a huge affirmation that theres a better way to build marketplaces for Kenya and the rest of urban Africa,” said Peter Njonjo, co-founder of Twiga Foods “We can get consumers and suppliers a better deal, and this support will go a long way in achieving those goals.

"Why we are working with Insight2Impact and FSDU for the DataHack for Financial Inclusion
","
 The Innovation Village has partnered with various players in the financial inclusion field to work on Datahack for Financial Inclusion. This is because the World economy’s operating system is being rewritten. Flows of people, capital, information, and commerce now determine who is winning. As this happens, emerging technologies are changing our society by scale and complexity.
 McKinsey estimates that this change is happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale. Or roughly 3,000 times the impact. Amidst this, new realities are shaping life back home in Uganda as we know it.
 Now standing with the youngest population, 69% of Ugandans are 24 years and below. With a current population of approximately 40 million people. 25,000 young people will be joining the labour force every week by 2020. With a theoretical education system in place. A Better option is key in preparing us for a completely new future.
 Our work at The Innovation Village is a direct response to this call. Every generation has a revolution. The revolution of this and the next generation is innovation and entrepreneurship.
 
 Globally, Innovation and entrepreneurship are taking on a new role for society today. Technology is changing how we live and connect. As we have experienced at home, it is also an agent for good. As various initiatives have demonstrated what Tech4good can achieve. An example is the Hack4Refugees. Where we have built Digital solutions for refugees and host communities.
 
 The initiative, supported by MercyCorps, UNCDF, and DanChurch Aid. Sought to boost the connectedness of refugees to the wider socio-economic system. So that they become agents of development of their own lives as well as their host community.
 
 The 10 solutions. Currently being accelerated peak to 3 critical challenges faced within the settlement. KUMI-KUMI, One of the solutions. for example, will seek to put refugees back to work and include them.
 
 Given they will earn a living and restore their dignity. They will be able to produce items. starting with art and crafts. And can sell these via an online platform to customers worldwide. From unemployment. Financial Inclusion and an increasing focus on SMEs and renewed drive for SDGs. Progress across these challenges requires an inclusive approach. which with the help of technology can get accelerated.
 
 Think about the impact of mobile money. And how it redefined the pathways for financial inclusion. As an innovation hub, we are in constant search for opportunities. To advance the role technology plays in this transformation. This presents a wave of challenges. with an equal measure of opportunities that need us not to think outside the box but to think like there is no box.
 Challenge 1: What do you do with an early ecosystem lacking the critical pillars. To not only support the process to start, to build, and grow sustainable ventures?
 Challenge 2: How do you approach this with a focus on sustainability. given there is no self-sustaining Hub in Africa?
 Challenge 3: The speed of technology means our life as we now know it is changing faster than our ability to adapt to it. as we are getting used to AI, Machine learning, and IoT, incomes Blockchain. As we adapt to new technologies, we have to remain relevant to the local content.
 Collaboration is the new competition.
 Our work has always inspired by the need to unlock opportunities. for Uganda’s innovation ecosystem.
 This, of course, cannot be easy in an early ecosystem. Given potential partners are also trying to figure the opportunities out. A central theme of our work is we are only as good as the partners we have. DataHack4FI an initiative of I2I presents such an opportunity to explore. In its second season, DataHack focuses on building solutions that advance financial inclusion.
 Season one brought together 28 startups to innovate around various datasets. This saw the winning teams competing at a regional stage in Kigali for a chance to win $100,000.
 With a different focus, Season two will seek to support Startups from 1–9 years in operation to better understand and make use of their data.
 The initiative will pair up companies that have not yet made use of data to drive product refinement/development. with data scientists (fellows). The goal is to show the value of utilizing internal data. To drive business operations and strategy.
 From our experience. Initiatives like these, build a collaborative spirit in the innovation ecosystem. which is much needed at this point. DataHack is also supported by Financial Sector Deepening Uganda. Who not only brings along local expertise but also builds constructive partnerships between Technology solution providers and Financial Service Providers.
 Why does all this matter? Because innovation remains one of the biggest advantage accelerators for our biggest community challenges. The DataHack wants to achieve this. By promoting the use of data and analytics for evidence-based decision-making. With the aim of better serving the underserved-including women, youth and smallholder farmers.
 Skills of the future
 During the Hack, we will connect emerging data scientists who will have opportunities to apply their skills to the challenge to deliver valuable financial services to the unserved and underserved across Africa.
 Plotting Uganda to the regional and global map
 There are six country-level competitions. The top teams from each country will join the DataHack4FI Grand Finale in Kigali, Rwanda.
 The startup world is well known for coming with up new disruptive ideas. Organizations are good at scaling up and incremental innovation. Putting this together will spark a new form of collaboration. Thus contributing to a new opportunity.
 DataHack is focused on building new local, regional and global collaborations that will go on to impact trends. Trends like financial inclusion, building new skills and leveraging technology for development.

"The Daily Brief: Tunisia&#8217;s drones in agriculture project, Cowrywise set for YC Demo day
","Hello there, we are changing the way we deliver to you what is happening across the continent. Thats why we have introduced the daily brief. We understand youre busy, so our intention is to help you understand what has happened across the continent regarding technology and startups in a few minutes.
 This segment will be presented to you in form of a curated article  of the top 5 stories   on our website as well as a The Daily Brief in your email inbox. I recommend that you subscribe to our mailing list to get it every day.
 Without saying much, lets dig in todays.
 
 Cowrywise accepted into YC
 
 What happened: Nigerian fintech startup was accepted into Y Combinators Summer 2018 batch, which means that theyll go ahead and pitch at YCs coming demo day. According to Techpoint, this comes just a week after they announced a $25,000.
 Why is it important: This comes at a point when YC is increasingly admitting African startups into their batches. From Afrostream (2015)  which has since closed shop to Flutterwave, Paystack, Kobo360, Tizeti and more. They have admitted at least 13 startups operating in or with African roots to-date. You can check them out here. Additionally, YC has opened its startup school which is a 10-weeks course. See more details here.

 2. Startup Grind is back to Zimbabwe
 What happened: Global startup community, Startup Grind, is coming back to Zimbabwe according to iAfrikan. The event will feature EcoCash CEO, Natalie Jabangwe.
 Why is it important: iAfrikan says that the event is making a return. That is good news itself alone. But, more important is that payments are to be made by EcoCash and the speaker is the CEO of EcoCash. This is an interesting event seeing that it is coming at a time when EcoCashs system just crushed a few weeks ago and got its users stranded. It will be interesting to find out what Natalie has to say.

 3. Mobile Money interoperability coming soon to Rwanda
 What happened: According to The East African, Airtel Rwanda, Tigo Rwanda and MTN are seeking regulatory approval to roll out cross-network services like their counterparts in Kenya and Tanzania.
 Why is it important: Mobile money subscribers in Rwanda can expect lower transaction costs and convenience as telcos move to integrate their systems. This also means that harmonizing transactions internally in all East African countries could mean the next step is harmonizing all telecoms in East Africa.

 4. ScholarX selected for global ed-tech accelerator
 What happened: Nigerian startup ScholarX has been chosen as one of five participants in the global WISE Accelerator, a programme aimed at developing innovative ed-tech startups.
 Why is it important: This comes at a time when Edtech is on the rise on the African continent. Just a few weeks ago, Injini  an edtech incubator  announced its second cohort of 8 startups selected from across the continent. Ugandan edtech startup  FundiBots  secured additional grant funding.

 5. Tunisia to launch drone project
 What happened: Tunisia is set to launch the pilot of a project aimed at using drones in agriculture. This is will take place on Thursday [26/07/2018] at a ceremony in Tunis.
 Why is it important: According to a press release from AfDB, they are looking to streamline agribusiness in Tunisia to increase efficiency. It also comes at a time when many across the continent are trying to use drones for various purposes. Plus, according to Osarumen, The Lagos State Government tweeted that it signed an MOU with drone company Zipline (of Rwandan fame) to provide supply chain solutions in the health sector.

"SolarWorks secures $2M in debt from SunFunder &#038; MFX Solutions
","SolarWorks – a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) company with operations in Mozambique – has secured a $2 million debt facility from SunFunder and US-based MFX Solutions. We are expanding into new markets, with our first transaction in Mozambique with SolarWorks!, wrote SunFunder.
 According to SunFunder, the transaction took an innovative multi-currency approach through their partnership with US-based currency hedging company MFX Solutions, which was making its very first transaction in the country.
 Mozambique, SunFunder wrote, has an electrification rate of less than 30% and limited availability of debt capital to support off-grid solar solutions.
 
 SolarWorks! will use the debt facility primarily for working capital to accelerate their growth in Mozambique. We aim for this to be the start of a long-term financing relationship to increase energy access in the country.
 
 According to the press release, the $2m debt facility will allow them to directly impact 65,000 people with improved energy access while displacing at least 26 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
 SolarWorks! began activity in Mozambique in 2011 and has recently expanded into Malawi.  The company provides a primary solar home system comprising lights and charging ports that can power phones, radios and small appliances as well as more powerful systems that can support small businesses and middle-income households with reliable power.
 In October last year, the solar company announced raising €2 million led EDP Renovaveis SA  with participation from Persistent Energy Partners  for expansion in Southern Africa. A year earlier, in May 2017, it was also among the recipients of the seed grant from GSMA under their  Mobile for Development Utilities Innovation Fund. The award was to facilitate them to implement machine learning to improve solar home systems downtime
 The investment was another example of SunFunder integrating MFX’s hedging services into their lending model to help our customers manage their exposure to currency risk.
 This debt facility to SolarWorks! is SunFunders second for 2019 after it arranged a $9 million facility for Uganda-based SolarNow alongside co-lenders responsAbility and Oikocredit.
 Last year, the solar-focused lender raised $25 million from Overseas Private Investment Corporation – OPIC. The investment was part of the commitment to its $100 million Solar Energy Transformation Fund. It also announced that it had secured an undisclosed amount from the Shell Foundation towards the same fund.

"Are we the Most Entrepreneurial or Just Gamblers?
","On Wednesday, one of my good ‘bros’ was trying to reach me. I think he had, again, come across ‘the best idea’. (Sorry bro, I know you might read this but I got to share).
 Unfortunately, I was preoccupied that day so couldn’t pick his calls. But, I sent him a WhatsApp message asking him if he was good. He said ‘yes’.
 And, of course, followed it up with the usual ‘how’s everything on your end’ to which said, ‘good and pushing harder’.
 However, I had contacted him some time back to write for me and he turned me down. So, I brought it up again in the conversation. He again said he was busy.
 When I saw busy, I was interested and pressed him harder. ‘ BUSY? with What?’, I pressed. He replied, ‘starting two businesses, a job and blah blah’.
 When he said starting two businesses, I switched off there and then. Who starts two businesses at ago? Boy, you got balls right there.
 Just starting one business is hard. Now two? In all Honesty, I didn’t care to find out which businesses or listen to any explanation. I’m just against spreading yourself so wide especially if you don’t have a firm footing yet.
 Business is not a first-shot, first hit game. It’s a first-several-shots-go-astray game. Just getting one off the ground is not easy. Now two?
 I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times — Bruce Lee
 People need to learn how to use the 80/20 rule in their favor. I’d rather be a master of one skill than average in everything.
 I remember in the first quarter of this year when I was struggling with anxiety. I spoke to one of the few people I speak to. He asked me, ‘do you want to be extremely great or great?’. I replied, ‘the former’.
 Then he asked, ‘which football team do you support?’ I told him ‘Real Madrid’. So, he asked me, ‘who’s the greatest player in their team?’ I said ‘Cristiano Ronaldo’. Then he asked, ‘how many numbers does he play?’. ‘One number, number seven’, I answered.
 So, this goes out to all those starting businesses in Uganda and Africa, don’t aim at being the greatest at everything but just one thing. You can always then do M&amp;As after you’ve grown.
 You should also note that you’ll have a lot of ideas cross your mind. But you don’t have to chase all. Just pick one, just one — and stick to that.
 Other than that, what we’re doing is gambling and not entrepreneurship.

"The Daily Brief: Visa Everywhere Initiative winners, Ex-Andela joins Facebook
","Here is a quick look at the top five stories of what has happened across the continent.
 
 HFC Launches Digital Banking Platform
 
 What happened: HFC, a banking subsidiary of HF Group, has today launched a banking application for its clients in Kenya. This is a mobile app called HFC Whizz.
 Why is this important: We are living in interesting times where banks are struggling to cope up with the rapid changes that are sweeping their industry. With the success of mobile money platforms, it is highly likely that banking for the majority in Sub-Saharan Africa Africa is going to be mobile in the long-run. Any company that wants to still be in business, therefore, it only makes sense to go in that direction.

 2. Silicon Valley VC model doesn’t work in Africa
 What happened: Manuel Koser, the managing director and co-founder of Silvertree Internet Holdings, emailed an article with the remarks that pointed out the fact that Africa or any other emerging market is different from Silicon Valley.
 Why is it important: Many people in Africa have discussed the continents startup ecosystem in comparison with the West  Silicon Valley to be more specific. This is perhaps those that are in the driving seat  even Africans  can trace their routes to that environment. This has taken away the uniqueness of the problems facing Africans which in turn has hindered crafting original solutions to such problems. However, Koser isnt the first person saying this. EchoVCs Eghosa Omoigui has re-echoed this message over and over.

 3. Ex-Google and Andela has joined Facebook
 What happened: Chimdindu Aneke has joined Facebook from Andela and is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the growth and success of startups and developers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
 Why is this important: Big tech is doubling down on Africa. This can be seen in their recent activities. Now is the time for those who are building their solutions to evaluate how they align with those of Facebook, Google, Microsoft and more.

 4. Visa everywhere initiative winners announced
 What happened: Kenyas Mookh has emerged the overall winner of the Visa Everywhere Initiative Sub-Saharan Edition.
 Why is this important: This is the very first edition for Sub-saharan Africa. Visa entering the market with such an initiative indicates the glaring opportunity the African continent still has. While as many thought the continent was getting crowded, entry of companies like Visa indicates otherwise.

 5. This website names and shames websites that dont use HTTPS
 What happened: A new service built by Troy Hunt, information security consultant and founder of haveibeenpwned, with data from Scott Helme, also an information security consultant, lists popular websites from across the world (by country) that load over an insecure connection without redirecting to a secure, encrypted connection.
 Why is this important: Online security is one of the topics taken seriously across Africa. However, with the ever-increasing data of Africans online, this is becoming risky. It is even riskier that most of the websites that are not secured are government websites.

"These are the 50 African startups to watch in 2019
","Digest Africas vision is to organize all the information and data about Africas tech startup ecosystem and also disseminate it in ways that are easier to consume and understand. That is why we are launching the Digest Africa NEXT50, to make it easier for some of Africas promising startups to be noticed.
 The list is a selection of the 50 African startups we are confident have the potential to take off and become the NEXT high-flyers. As we highlight these startups, we also create opportunities for them in terms of follow-on funding, strategic partners as well as customers or users.
 We follow a strict criterion which involves only considering startups that were founded not more than two years ago. This means that for the 2018 list, we considered those that were founded not earlier than January 1, 2017. Startups founded in that period but have raised over $1 million in funding  like Kobo360  arent considered also. Please note that the startups are arranged in alphabetical order.
 We have published the list here or you can visit www.digestafrica.com/NEXT50 to check it out. Below are the summaries and statistics of the entire list.
 Statistics
 The list was dominated by startups from the Financial Services industry followed by those in the Transportation and Logistics sector.
 
 All the 50 startups came from only 16 countries and Egypt dominated the list with 24% followed by Nigeria at 20%.
 
 We considered only 2 years and those from 2017 took the biggest chunk
 
 In total, the startups raised $7 million in funding last year. The list was led by Malis Teliman and Egypts Fakahany at $700,000 each. We excluded startup that with undisclosed funding or that never raised for the graph chart below.

"YC startups in Africa have raised over $58.3M in total follow-on funding
","Welcome to the first edition of Digest Africa Research Briefs. We shall be sending out at least one Research Brief a week, and the focus is on particular segments in Africas tech ecosystem that need spotlighting. This week, we are taking an in-depth look at startups in Africa that have been admitted into Y Combinator, how they have faired and any other important notes to know about them.
 Summary
 Twenty-eight (28) startups in Africa have taken part in Y Combinators accelerator. These have come from 9 countries and Nigeria  with 13 startups translating into 46.3%  has had the highest number. PetaSales from Ibadan, Nigeria. The startup took part in Y Combinators Winter 2009 batch. Nala, a Tanzania-based financial services startup, is the latest entrant into Y Combinator after taking part in the Winter 2019 batch. Overall, the startups have raised at least $58.3 million in follow-on funding with Flutterwave raising the most amount. The financial services startup has raised at least $20 million in two different Series As. With 35.7% of the total admitted into the accelerator, the financial services sector is the most dominant.
 
 Over the years
 At 35.7%, which translated into ten startups, 2017 has the highest number of startups from Africa admitted into Y Combinator in a single year. Seven of the ten startups came from Nigeria; Aella Credit, BuyPower, Helium Health (formerly One Medical), RelianceHMO (formerly Kangpe), Kudi, Releaf and Tizeti. While the other three were; Trade (Ghana), Tress (Ghana) and WaystoCap (Ghana).
 However, before that, there were a couple of African and Africa-focused startups to take part in the accelerator.
 Contrary to the belief that Paystack was the first Nigerian startup to get into Y Combinator, The Y Combinator Database (YCDB) indicates that it is PetaSales from Ibadan. The online advertising startup was admitted into YC 10 years ago, though, according to YCDB, they have since then shut down their operations.
 
 
 ADVERT: Africa’s early stage and technology companies recorded 454 deals last year worth $1.19 Billion. Get the Digest Africa Index to find out more.
 
 
 Six years later,  Afrostream (based in France but Africa-focused), Kenyas Saida and Dakar-based Oolu followed PetaSales. Like PetaSales, Afrostream also shut down in September 2017. Tonjé Bakang, the founder and CEO of Afrostream, chronicled the ups and downs that let to their shutting down. Both Saida and Oolu are still operational with the former not much in the limelight because they like being under the radar as one of the people familiar with them told Digest Africa.
 
 In 2016, eight startups from Africa joined the accelerator. These included; Envyl (formerly Shypmate, Ghana), Flutterwave, Instabug (Egypt), Kuhustle (Kenya), Lynks (Egypt), OMG Digital (Ghana), Paystack (Nigeria) and WorldCover (Ghana).
 In 2018, the number dropped to only 5  half of 2017. The list of admitted startups saw three come from Nigeria; BuyCoins, Cowrywise and Kobo360, while the remainder all came from South Africa: Passerine Aircraft Corporation as well as Names &amp; Faces. Nale, from Tanzania, is the first publicly known startup from Africa to take part in Y Combinators 2019 batches though the number is likely to peak as the year goes on.
 Year Founded
 Most (8) of the (28) startups that have taken part in YCs program were founded in 2015. While PetaSales, founded in 2008, is the oldest on the list.
 
 Countries
 Of the 28 startups that have been admitted into Y Combinator from Africa, 13 are from Nigeria translating into 46.4% of the total. The other notable country with a significant number of startups accepted into the accelerator is Ghana with four translating into 17.9%.
 In 2016, Y Combinator partners  Qasar Younis and Michael Seibel  visited Lagos for what would the first and only event the accelerator has organised on the continent. The duos visit was aimed at drumming up applications to the accelerator from the continent, which can partly explain why the country has had the stronghold when it comes to admission into the accelerator.
 
 Y Combinator Alumni also routinely organise meetups before applications into the next batch. These activities have primarily taken place in Nigeria and Ghana, with Paystack at the forefront of this with two meet-ups hosted so far  in 2017 and 2018.
 Sector
 If youre building a financial technology company, youre 3x more likely to get into Y Combinator than those working on products in other industries. According to the data, over a third of the companies admitted into Y Combinator from Africa are in the sector. These have also gone to raise the most significant sizes in follow-on funding. Flutterwave, the company with the highest follow-on funding at $20 million as well as Paystack  which has raised over $11 million in follow-on funding  are both in the fintech sector.
 
 Batch
 Y Combinator admits startups twice a year in two batches; Winter and Summer. Most startups in Africa usually get into the Winter batch.
 
 Status
 According to YCDB, of the 28 startups, only two are dead  Afrostream and PetaSales. However, Ghanas Tress  who took part in the Winter 2017 batch  also seems to have shut down. The startups website is no longer active. It also last posted on Instagram  a channel it widely used  on May 5, 2018.
 Follow-on Funding
 Most startups that take part in accelerators  not just YC- are looking to raise follow-on funding after the seed. We therefore only considered follow-on funding as Series A onwards  with any financing in the form of grants/non-equity assistance or seed from other accelerators not included.
 Combined, the 2018 startups have raised a total of at least $58.3 million in follow-on funding. Flutterwave, with over $20 million in follow-on funding is the most funded on the list followed by Paystack which has raised above $11 million. The other notable ones on the list include; Kobo360 ($7.2M), Tizeti ($5.1M) and Oolu ($3.2M).
 Flutterwave has raised the most follow-on funding
 The figure could have been higher. However, some companies never disclosed their follow-on funding. Some of the startups that raised follow-on funding but never unveiled include; Afrostream (Orange Digital Ventures), BuyCoins (Precursor Ventures) and Aella Credit (Y Combinator &amp; 500 Startups). While Oolu also never disclosed the Series B that they raised from GAIA Impact fund in July 2018.
 Investors
 Under this section, we look at who is backing Y Combinator alumni in Africa. Some of the notable names that have backed more than one startup or participated in more than one round involving YC startups in Africa include; Y Combinator, Soma Capital (OMG Digital, WaystoCap), Lynett Capital (Waystocap, Tizeti), Social Capital (OMG Digital, Tizeti), Tencent Holdings (Paystack, Seed &amp; Series A), as well as Plug and Play (WorldCover, Flutterwave).
 Notes: Though not headquartered/incorporated in Africa, WorldCover and Afrostream were included because they had Africa as their primary markets. You can also read our methodology to understand more about our research basis.

"To build a successful company, start with a clearly defined problem &#8211; Dustyn Winder
","When you talk about startups and investments in Africa, only a few cities come to people’s mind. Yet, with the increase in venture capital flowing to the continent, this is beginning to change. Dustyn Winder, the managing partner at akili.vc decided to set up in Kampala.
 In this interview, we explored why he made that decision, what Akili is, if they have made any investments so far and their medium-term plans.
 At the end, I challenged him to point out a couple of startups in Uganda he would put his money in as well as a little advice to entrepreneurs. If you’re a corporate, a startup or an investor, this is for you. Enjoy.
 Malinz: You describe Akili as an early stage or pre-seed fund, right? What does that mean?
 Dustyn Winder: Its everywhere from pre-seed all the way to Series C. Though we say pre-seed to series A, this is because we spun out of an existing organization called Prehype, whose shared model gives us the flexibility to participate from day zero all the way to the post MVP [minimum viable product] days of a company.
 Prehype is based in New York, London and Copenhagen with a presence in other cities around the world. It is a venture development firm and studio that works primarily with strategic [corporate] partners. Prehype goes to corporates and says, ‘lets go through an innovation workshop, lets identify unique problem spaces that a subject matter expert entrepreneur is equipped to address’.
 These problems are traditionally, for whatever reason, hidden or locked off from entrepreneurs. In the case of corporates, its often a problem that exists within an internal environment that an entrepreneur would never even know about.
 And so then, working with the corporate team, we come up with product ideas, recruit an entrepreneur, build an MVP. This is all with the goal of it ultimately becoming a company in which the corporate and Prehype are shareholders and the entrepreneur becomes founder and CEO.
 We structured Akili based around this model. We liked the idea of identifying problem spaces and building products that solve those problems but combining it with the financial capabilities of a more traditional venture vehicle.
 If we’re making a “venture” investment, it is in either Seed or Series A. Those cheque sizes are in the low to mid six figures USD. We then reserve capital for the purpose of following on in our portfolio companies’ B and C rounds. So when I talk about pre-seed, I’m not generally speaking about investing in existing companies. Its co-founding companies. It’s the Prehype model of structured incubation to turn these products into companies and get them all the way to a Seed or Series A, where we would then likely make a venture investment.
 So has Prehype developed any products so far in the East African region?
 Thats actually where Akili came in. I have consulted with a couple Prehype partners for a while and I was brought in to explore doing business in East Africa due to my background in the region.
 Prehype is headquartered in New York with offices in London and Copenhagen. Prior to Akili they had done projects on every continent but Africa.
 Related: Aga Sekalala Jr is setting up an Angel/VC fund in Uganda, the first by a Ugandan
 So I came on [board] to kind of explore what it looks like to bring the model [to Africa]. Because, again, its really just a framework, a model, and a network. [But the question was] ‘what would it look like to bring this model to Sub Saharan Africa, with a focus on East Africa.
 After talking to a lot of people in Uganda, but also Kenya, South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Ghana, we came to a conclusion that the model makes a lot of sense. It makes sense because its connecting entrepreneurs who are good at building things with clearly defined problem spaces. And we believed that more than product, what matters is pairing a problem or opportunity with the right person or team.
 What I understand from this is that where there is Prehype, there is akili.vc, right? So is Akili also in New York, London, and Copenhagen?
 Akili is currently in New York and Kampala. Our mid-term plan is to have an Akili presence around the [African] continent. So, basically, venture partners in key [African] startup cities of Nairobi, Lusaka, Cape Town, Lagos as a distributed team.
 Because, again, based on this idea of a network of entrepreneurs, we like the idea of having a large geographic network as well. So right now we base out of Prehype in New York and in Kampala as well.
 You pointed out that you partner with corporates. And what I understand is that you’re the General Partners and they join as Limited Partners. Why would they join as LPs?
 While we personally as General Partners (GPs) believe that there will be liquid venture returns [in the fund], our approach to building a fund is not selling Limited Partners (LPs) solely on this potential. Rather, we sell them on the fact that there are quantifiable strategic returns in making investments in Africa.
 Traditionally, most of the “venture” investment going into Sub-Saharan Africa is impact [tagged]. And so we are saying that impact is one strategic area that a corporate can focus on. You know [through] CSR. Then that makes sense in some regards. But there are other strategic interests that a corporate could have.
 So, rather than spending tens of millions of dollars setting up a branch and a subsidiary and exploring these things, why not make  in comparison  what is a relatively inexpensive investment and become an LP [with Akili]? You get the same kind of strategic benefits and market intel that you would get by yourself.
 In some cases, those strategic benefits are CSR and impact. But in other cases, they are identifying deal flow for potential mergers and acquisitions, or identifying B2B customers and potential strategic partnerships.
 Since you are based in Kampala, is your current focus on corporates in Kampala?
 No. The reason why I am based in Kampala is personal and somewhat strategic. We are focused on East Africa [as a whole]. But the reason why I am based in Kampala as opposed to Nairobi is twofold;
 First is the unique selling point. Any VC that has a presence in East Africa is in Nairobi. Secondly, I have been in Kampala back and forth for a decade now. It is where my personal networks are. It is where I feel most comfortable.

 [But when it comes to our target corporates], we are primarily focused on multinationals out of Europe and the USA. [But also] increasingly, we are trying to talk to Chinese companies. Thats not by very selective choice. It is more of thats where we found the most traction. We havent found the African corporates [that] have much interest in this. However, if any end up reading this and are interested, by all means, reach out.
 Obviously, Safaricom has demonstrated an interest in making these kinds of investments. But they are already doing it in various ways. They have their innovation center, they invest in funds and have developed products on top of M-Pesa.
 MTN, out of South Africa, has made a lot of investments and has funded investments. But these are primarily really big cheques at later stages. At the earlier stage, we found that those companies generally are interested in partnering with startups but not so much at putting significant capital on the line.
 When do you think akili.vc will be actively making investments? 6 months time?
 We are just trying to move forward on the business streams that we have, partnering with corporates on product development, incubation, accelerations, and more traditional consulting engagements. But yes, we are targeting for 6 months. We are actively having conversations quite literally every day. Currently, we are working with various partners on different forms of deal flow.
 We have only one investment thus far. It was actually made before the official formation of Akili. Its a drone company, though based out of the USA. But it does most of its work, currently, in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 You have been here for a decade. Are there some startups that you have put your money or would have put your money in? As an individual!
 I have only made one angel investment in my life and it was in the USA. [But] there are certainly startups that have been interesting [here]. [Though] most have been in the last few years.
 There is Xente. It is very interesting. ClinicPesa is one we have been speaking with and Matibabu.
 Then there are companies that are now in the market that you would not necessarily think of as startups. Like Ezeemoney. I think that Ezeemoney is an interesting opportunity because I dont think most people think of it as a technology startup. Thats a good thing because that makes them approachable.
 They have an analog world physical presence but are able to scale through digital products. They run on technology. They are a technology-enabled business. And I think there is an opportunity for companies like Ezeemoney to partner with companies that are more pure technology plays and really use the advantages of the kind of traditional brick and mortar boots on the ground type of businesses with the scalability of digital businesses.
 Do you get people sending you pitch decks to run through?
 I get them every day. One of the things that is the largest frustration for me and the ones that are not going to get past the first step are those just following the crowd and the trends. Just because someone is doing something in their business does not mean everyone should follow on and do that.
 Similarly, I think that many entrepreneurs expectations are a bit off when it comes to fundraising, and they dont fully understand equity. I have met entrepreneurs who do not care about equity at all and thats a red flag. Because I want you to want the equity in your company. That means you believe in its potential for real scale.
 But again, others care too much about equity at an early stage. They will fight over one or two percent. Its not worth it. Valuations, in the beginning, mean nothing really. If you are pre-revenue, valuation is just what someone is willing to pay you. It’s based on speculation.
 Dont get caught up in equity to an extent of protecting your equity the same way you would if someone was trying to write you a $20,000 cheque for 50% of your business. Thats ridiculous. Dont do that. All in all, dont focus so much on the micro, focus on the macro and building a real business.
 What advice do you have for entrepreneurs?
 Do your research before you reach out to somebody. I often get pitched by people with startups that dont at all fit with anything we are looking to do, and its not that they are always even bad businesses. Sometimes they may be quite good but they dont fit within what we have said we do and [what we do] is out there on the internet. Do your research.

"In Brief: GreenTec Capital has invested in Namibia&#8217;s PEBL
","GreenTec has today announced that they made an investment into Namibia-based PEBL, a producer of high-tech central processing units (CPUs) to support Africa’s growing IT needs.
 As with most GreenTec deals, no financial details were provided. However, it is highly likely that the deal has some non-monetary aspects like the one they did with Parcel-IT a few weeks ago. Or, as many of the deals  in Kenyas Bismart and Ugandas Wazi Vision  they have focused on, have been.
 Founded in 2015, PEBL is a producer of high-tech central processing units (CPUs) to support Africa’s growing IT needs.
 According to GreenTec, more and more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are developing in Africa. At the same time, their technology needs are growing.
 Yet despite this growth, the penetration of computers in Africa is still very low, with only three computers for every one thousand Africans, writes GreenTec.  Adding that, this is due in part to the low presence of major PC manufacturers on the continent as well as a lack of affordable options suitable to customer’s personal and business needs.
 PEBL’s vision is to change this situation. That is by manufacturing tailor-made CPUs that fit each customer’s identity and needs by giving them the option to customize their machines.
 This will be done with the highest quality hardware and software components for a range of computing applications including IoT, media, home security, business computing, as well as a range of personal computing options.

"Protection for Ugandan Innovators: What You Need to Know
","Ugandans are coming up with new or better ways to do things. However, few know how to go about protecting their innovations or inventions. How do you ensure your innovation or invention is protected? Where do you go, when and what can be protected? These are some of the questions that remain un-answered to many innovators or inventors in Uganda.
 James Lubwama is an examiner with Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) and his role is to ensure innovators and inventors are guided on the best way to protect their inventions. He joined URSB in 2012 and since then, he has witnessed a series of changes at the registration body of the Ugandan government.
 One of the things that confuse innovators are the different levels of protection. The most known is patenting and therefore it is no surprise that almost all innovators that approach URSB request for a patent there and then.
 However, one needs to note that they can only be granted a level of protection that suits them best. This is also done with advise by the examiners. And one should also note that not everything can be patented or protected as youll find out.
 Patent
 According to URSB, a patent is an exclusive right granted by the government for an invention, which is either a product or process that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. The exclusive rights help inventors to prevent others from taking advantage of their ideas and inventions.
 
 There are levels of protection. If you come up with a completely new product, a completely new solution to an existing problem, you qualify for a patent. However, if you just make an improvement of something thats existing, yes youve made an improvement but that will only qualify you for a utility model  James Lubwama.
 
 Utility Model
 A Utility Model, just like a patent, also provides exclusive rights to inventors and innovators for their new products and processes. The requirements for granting a Utility Model are less stringent compared to those of patent protection.
 For the Utility Model, the requirement of a product or process having an inventive step is not considered. Utility Model protection is for shorter period of time normally 10 years.
 Take an example of Mugarura Samuel, a Makerere University student, who made teargas less toxic. He was granted a Utility certificate in recognition of his innovation. A Utility certificate maybe referred to as  a lesser Patent.
 Similarly, the innovator of MAP Alarm system doesnt qualify for a patent, but instead a utility certificate. Reason being, he is not the first to invent an alarm but just making an improvement.
 According to James, until the Industrial Property Act of 201, URSB was not in position to examine patents and utility models.
 
 Initially, we were using the patents ACT of  of 2013 that hadnt made provision for local examination. It stated explicitly that examination of utility models or patents had to be done by ARIPO. We realized that was a challenge. Because a utility model could be a simple improvement. Because of that, we now have The Industrial Property Act of 2014. This empowers URSB to examine utility models locally. If that gentleman (of MAP Alarm systems) applied today, in 30 days hell have his certificate  James Lubwama
 
 Industrial designs
 An industrial design is the aesthetic aspect of a useful object. Industrial designs protect the appearance of a useful object. An industrial design may consist of three dimensional features, such as the shape of an article, or two dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or color. For example; a mineral water bottle, a pattern or a cloth like a Kitengé, the shape of a car etc.
 Cost
 According to James, URSB is currently reviewing the fees for the various levels of protection. However, for anyone filing an application now, theyll have to consider the old costings.
 It would cost one 180,000/- for a patent application and 300,000/- for the certificate once it has been granted. The innovator would then be required to part with a maintenance fee of 48,000/- for the first year and an additional 12,000/- for each subsequent year. These fees are for a patent to cover Uganda.
 However for those interested in filing their patents with the regional office  African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO), theyd have to part with $150 for application and an additional $75 for each country youd like it to cover.
 In case an innovation qualifies as a utility model, itd cost one UGx. 60,000 for filing the application and UGx. 100,000 for the certificate. This is UGx. 160,000 in total. However, one would have to pay an annual maintenance fee of UGx. 18,000 for the first year and UGx. 4,000 for the subsequent years. Again, these are for the Ugandan office.
 Duration
 All forms of protection provide protection for a limited period of time. Normally, a patent takes up-to 20 years. While a utility certificate takes 10 years. During this period, everyone else  except the innovator is prevented from exploiting the invention.
 It takes at least 2 years from when one files for their patent up-to when it is granted and only 30 days for one to be granted a utility certificate. According too James, patents take that period of time mostly because of the human resource capacity.
 However, the period seems to be fair given that in India, it takes an average of 2 years for one to get granted a patent and slightly more for the US office.
 Legal representation
 It is a common saying that a patent or any form of protection for an innovation or invention is only as good as the person who drafts it. What this statement means is that one needs to be an expert at filing for patents or any form of protection for them to draft an exhaustive application.
 Otherwise, an unskilled applicant will end up underselling their innovation or over-declaring the coverage of their innovation. Both scenarios arent good for an innovator. In the first scenario, the innovator leaves loopholes that could be exploited by competition while in the second scenario, the innovator stands a disadvantage of their application being denied.
 It is on this ground that all innovators or inventors seeking protection are advised to first seek legal help. However, in reality, this seems not to be applicable in Uganda as most innovators are youths who are plagued with unemployment and thus unable to foot legal fees. Actually, some are not even in position to foot application fees.
 
 You need to understand our innovation terrain. We can all agree that most of the people who are innovating are youths who dont even have the 60,000/- to apply. Lawyers are private people who are running a business. Just drafting can cost an innovator over 1,000,000 which could even be a minimum  James Lubwama.
 
 The Bureau therefore extends an advisory role to these innovators and goes as far as helping them draft applications. The body is also ensuring capacity building to enable the IP office handle the growing number of applicants.
 Wavers 
 This came with the new act. Innovators or inventors who may not be in position to foot the necessary fees stand a chance of being granted patents or protection minus parting with a penny. But, the entire procedure and criteria is a bit subjective.
 
 The law provides for wavers. The registrar general has the powers to exercise this. One needs to state reasons as to why they need a waver. Then, the decision is to be taken by the Registrar general  James Lubwama.
 
 Although it is a bit subjective, one can only use logic to figure it out. For example, if an institution applies for a waver and a student, then a student is more likely to get this waver. Likewise, if a person looking to use an innovation for individual interests and another for to help a community, chances are the latter will be considered.
 Area of coverage
 This, too, remains subjective. However, James argues that a patent or any form of protection should only cover an area that makes both logical and business sense to the party applying. Therefore, one can apply for a patent in any country or region they desire.
 However, it is advisable to apply for a patent in a country where one is expecting to expand operations or where they suspect their idea might be duplicated.
 
 You dont just say i want protection in a certain country. There has to be a reason as to why you want the protection. Are you planning to expand or do you have a partner on that country that might run away with your idea? For example people apply for protection in China because someone might run away with their ideas  James Lubwama.
 
 Different countries or regions have different requirements for one to file for protection. Therefore the costs might be out of reach. For example, filing for protection in a country like Cameroon  which is French speaking  will require you to translate everything.
 Therefore youll be required to get legal help. In case such protection wont result into business sense, then thats money going down the drain.
 First to Invent Vs. First to File
 In Uganda, the person who gets awarded protection is the one first to apply. This is attributed to the fact that it is not easy to establish who invented or innovated something first. This same mode is used by the US Intellectual Property governing body.
 Regional Overview
 According to James, we are fairing as efficiently as other regional offices. He is however quick to point out that the landscape is not flat. For example, the Kenyan office is almost three times more equipped than the Ugandan office in terms of human resource.
 
 We attend the same training as our counterparts from across the region and we are in constant touch  James Lubwama.
 
 Though he declined to comment on the allocation of funding, his tone indicated that their counterparts are a little bit more funded. This he brought out by saying that Kenya is doing more outreaches compared to the Ugandan office.
 It should also be noted that the Kenyan office has been doing examinations for over 30 years while the Ugandan just got permission 3 years ago. This therefore explains the difference in number of patents granted or filed.
 Alternatives
 There are also people who may not be in position to afford the services at the moment or whose ideas or products may not be able to be patented or protected. Yet they feel no one outside the team or company should get to know about what they are doing. For example, the bigger the team, the more likely that information on how something is done will leak.
 In such a case, teams are encouraged to sign non-disclosure agreements. However good you maybe as friends, it is recommended that you sign this agreement before your company or startup starts bringing in any form of revenue.
 Secondly, there are trade secrets. This applies to categories like herbalists. Someone may know of a plant that can help cure a certain disease. Such can not be patented but the advise is that one keeps it as a secret to themselves. As long as it works, people will keep buying the products.
 Challenges
 Currently, URSB is doing a minimum of two outreaches per month. However, this was not the case a year ago where they were doing the same number in a year. They have had to deal with challenges regarding funds as well as human resource capacity. This of course not only slows the time itd take for one to be granted a certificate but also the audience that URSB is able to reach.
 However, things seem to be changing as they are actually planning for over four outreaches this month and also organizing awards for the very first time. With offices in Mbale, Mbarara, Gulu, Arua and four more in Kampala  theyve tried to ensure they reach all through out the country.
 Conclusion
 URSB is already moving in the right direction with its regional outreaches. Just this week they launched the Intellectual Property Awards. However, more needs to be done in terms of efficiency and sensitization.

"Somalia&#8217;s agrifood startup Agrikaab shuts down its goats and sheep farms
","In 2016 Mohamed Jimale launched Ari.farm, an agrifood startup with a crowdfunding model whose mission was to allow individuals from all over the world to invest in and own goats and sheep in Somalia. The animals were taken care of by people in Somalia who are experienced in animal handling and farming. The investor would then follow up on their investment via an app.
 Ari.farm, with an eye on East Africa, later expanded beyond Somalia  to Kenya  where they opened up a camel farm.
 In Somali, the word Ari means livestock and specifically goats and sheep. The startup had therefore named themselves Ari.farm to mean goats and sheep farm focused. However, since they had expanded beyond just goats  to include camels and greenhouses  they thought it wise to rebrand. They finally rebranded in January 2019 to Agrikaab.
 “Goats were never our mission but a means to reach our mission which was to create employment for former nomads in Somalia and contribute to the local economy,” the startup wrote in the press release.
 However, following the rebrand was the shutting down of its goats and sheep farms in central Mogadishu. “At the end of 2018, we finally decided to close the goats and sheep farm,” wrote Mohamed Jimale, the founder of Agrikaab, in the press release.
 At the time of shutting down the farm, Swedish blog BreakIt estimates that Agrikaab had received around SEK 700,000  an equivalent of US $75,000  from investors into the farm.
 According to Agrikaab, they “informed users who invested in the goats and sheep”. Agrikaab added that they “will take responsibility for the losses and that we will pay them [back]”. However, the startup acknowledges that the process of figuring out the repayment has not been easy. “Unfortunately even that became difficult as we have not been able to get external investment or enough cash flow in the company,” wrote Agrikaab.
 There are no details provided byAgrikaab regarding how much is supposed to be paid back to the investors overall.
 When contacted by Digest Africa, Jimale declined to delve into the details of the shutdown. “We have moved on from the issue with goats and sheep farm,” Jimale wrote in an email. Adding that “this was one project that failed among our projects and we have communicated with the people who invested in this project about all of these questions.”
 The startup’s website states that the shut down wasn’t abrupt: the goats and sheep farm was plagued with challenges from the onset. “When we started Agrikaab (Ari.farm) we started with one goat farm in Mogadishu,” the company pointed out. “Things started well but after a few months, we faced the first problems”.
 “In 2017, we decided to move the operation to central Somalia and change focus from breeding to trading. This too became problematic due to market issues and other logistical problems”. Jimale never pointed out which “market issues” and “logistical problems” led to the failure of the project.

 The company blames the failure of the project on the harsh conditions under which they operate. “We faced all sorts of problems such as diseases, security, and a shortage of food,” Agrikaan noted.
 “In one instance, someone who took hundreds of animals from us never paid us a single dollar back.” The other issue that the company blames for the failure of the goats and sheep farm is the “political problems between Somalia and export markets made the market difficult.”
 “We have failed on the goats and sheep project! But we have not failed on our mission or as a company.”
 This is not the first time Agrikaab is facing challenges. Two weeks ago, the startup announced on its LinkedIn that they were moving into new and more secure offices after their previous ones had been affected. “Our last office at Maka Al Mukarama Road was destroyed in an explosion in February,” the company wrote.
 In February 2019, Agrikaab also shut down their camel farm in Kenya. “We have decided to close our camel farm in Nairobi effective from March 1, due to a couple of issues that we could not resolve,” the startup noted.
 Going forward, Jimale says that the startup will now focus on other initiatives. According to the press release, the failure of the goats and sheep farm project will not affect Agrikaab’s other initiatives. “We have never used funds from one farm to invest in another,” noted Agrikaab.
 “We have separated the finances of each project. That is why any issues related to goats or sheep farm will not affect other farms.”
 The company is now going to focus on camels as well as other projects but in the Somali market. The focus for Agrikaab appears to be a crowdfunding model targeting investment into greenhouses (vegetables), livestock (camel farms targeting dairy) and water (farm ponds). To this end, in March 2019, Agrikaab announced the introduction of fish ponds. While in April 2019, it announced that construction works aimed at expanding the greenhouses in Mogadishu had commenced.

"Startup of the Week: Musana Carts &#8211; The Street Vending Revolution
","Uganda is currently suffering from elevated levels of youth unemployment and many of the reasons for this stem from the inability to grow their business to sustain their livelihoods. Musana Carts offers a path to a sustainable, reliable income through street vending.
 In Kampala, like most of Africas urban areas, street vendors make a living selling food and drinks. With the right support, small food vending businesses can build a clean, legitimate and dependable working environment. The current economic climate is such that with this help, micro-entrepreneurs can find success easily as a result of a burgeoning middle class and a lively culture that promotes social gatherings and informal eating habits.
 Low income, self-employed earners find it difficult to break into the formal economy due to, amongst other things, a lack of seed capital, poor existing business models and practices, and no clear route to legal licensing.  Musana Carts addresses these issues, offering street vending carts on a rent-to-own scheme, offering key training on how to run a business, providing financial advice and help to enable people to earn a better living.
 Related: Startup of the Week: Coupon Book – a Low-Cost Advertising Ugandan Startup
 Musana Carts offer low-income earners a path to self-employment under the umbrella of an organisation fighting for and helping them.  Musana Carts sets them on a path to business ownership whilst offering help and advice to speed up their progress.
 Unlike other businesses and startups, Musana Carts not only measures its success basing on figures such as individual and total vendor sales revenue and profit, but also metrics such as street food customer satisfaction, cleanliness of carts, vendor quality of life and work-life balance.
 According to Angus Marjoribanks, Field Operations Manager for Musana Carts;
 
 All our vendors are showing profit growth, up to 200%, having taken possession of a Musana Cart.  This is incredible progress, showing that our theory is working and that people are seeing huge benefits. We plan to have more than quadrupled our presence in Uganda within a year.  With this comes a drastic growth in impact on our target demographic, with extra profit earned as a result of Musana Carts, reaching $250,000 per year.
 
 A Musana Cart is a movable cart fitted with an eco-stove for cooking and a solar panel pviding light and a provision for a mini-fridge. It was developed by an incredibly diverse team of 3 passionate social entrepreneurs. Manon Lavaud as the strategic lead, Nataliey Bitature as the Head of Operations and Keisuke Kubota as the head of branding and marketing.
 Musana Carts biggest areas of impact are job creation – creating employment for up to 3 vendors per cart, reduced carbon emission and fire hazards, solar energy to provide power, helping the vendors to be legally recognised by the authorities, ensuring food safety and generating sustainable and reliable income.
 Detailed Illustration of a Musana cart
 Musana Carts was recently accepted into the Unreasonable Institute East Africa to help take their business to the next level. They have also received generous funding from OpenIdeo to help develop rigorous testing methods to ensure that they offer the best possible product and service and to help kickstart a larger rollout of carts across Kampala.
 We can’t wait to see how these new funding streams and business support push Musana Carts towards much bigger and much better things in the coming years.

"Why Everyone Is Confused By &#8220;African Startups&#8221; Funding Figures
","On January 14, 2019, we released our very first report  Digest Africa Index  which focuses on investment into Africas early stage and technology companies for the year 2018.
 In that report, we pointed out that these companies were involved in 454 deals worth $1.19 billion. These deals are a combination of both funding and M&amp;A deals. We also added that the funding figures were at $686.4 million from 415 deals while 39 M&amp;A deals were recorded.
 However, our report came out a few weeks after Weetracker had released their own Venture Capital report. The blogs report put the venture capital  not startup  funding figure at $725.6 million. Early this week, Disrupt Africa also released their annual report titled African Tech Startups Funding Report 2018. In the report, they put the funding figure  by startups  at $334.5 million.
 Though, before the Disrupt Africa report came out, iAfrikan had published an article pointing out the fact that those who compile these reports on startup funding in Afrika rely on publicly disclosed funding in most cases. That statement was only partly true because we dont focus on startup funding, neither does Weetracker do  per this tweet from Rishabh Lawania  a co-founder at Weetracker.
 
 Weetracker’s report talk on venture &amp; risk capital deployed in Africa Hq’ed and focussed COMPANIES. Figuring out the definition of a startup is very tricky which is why our report doesn’t mention ‘startups’ anywhere
 — Rishabh Lawania (@rishabh_lawania) January 29, 2019
 
 Secondly, we do not only rely on figures from public resources. There are a couple of fund managers and companies that do submit their deals in confidentiality. We, therefore, anonymise that data to keep them away from the public eye.
 Though, the article pointed out that you should read [the reports] with caution if you are looking to make important decisions based on these articles and reports. That is a statement everyone should pay attention to.
 Recently, everyone has come out either to criticise or discredit the reports just because they have differing figures. Why would three reports that are focused on totally different things have the same figures?
 What most people havent done is critically read each and every report as well as the methodologies deployed. As Digest Africa, we not only published a methodology on our website, we also published the one that we used for Digest Africa Index as well as the Executive Summary.
 Yet, I am still disturbed that people are continuing to compare apples and oranges as well as misquote certain elements of the report for whatever reason, I do not know.
 Before releasing their report, Tom Jackson of Disrupt Africa quoted the iAfrikan article and tagged Digest Africa as well as Weetracker with a tone that seemed like he was accusing the two of misleading people. He went on to insinuate that Digest Africas report said that African startups raised a billion dollars. This was not only wrong, but it also wasnt acceptable of someone who is a journalist to accuse others of something that was wrong (see the tweet thread below).
 
 This from @iafrikan is all true, but borders on stating the obvious. No, we cannot know what we do not know. But we do our best to know it https://t.co/jIxZcua66c
 — Tom Jackson (@tomjackson1988) January 17, 2019
 
 However, this has not stopped. The issue has continued to escalate every passing day.
 An example is Max Cuvellier, who works with GSMA as Mobile for Development Head of Programme. Max raised the point of the figures differing on January 29, 2019, on his twitter. But as you can see below, he quoted a wrong figure from our end as he only referenced the number for the top 50 most funded. Besides, this comparison shouldnt be made at all because the three reports  as i have already pointed out  are totally different. Apples and oranges!!
 
 🌍 How much have African start-ups raised in 2018?
 Is it $335M (@DisruptAfrica)?
 $618M (@digestafrica)?
 Or $726M (@weetracker) maybe?
 In any case, the total amount keeps growing,
 more and more start-ups are raising,
 &amp; more and more investors investing 👍👍👍 pic.twitter.com/V6oHt0qS1V
 — Max Cuvellier (@Cvllr) January 29, 2019
 
 The issue was also picked up by Maxime Bayen who also works at GSMA as the Insights Director for M4D Programme. Maxime came up with a visual which he published today.
 Not only was the visual escalating the apples to oranges comparison, but he also pointed out that the number of funding deals by African startups from our report as 454. I already pointed out that our report is not focused on startups, so that was not correct. Additionally, we never recorded 454 as the funding deals  the number was 415.
 
 Way Forward
 We are committed to building Africas technology ecosystem as Digest Africa with every single ounce of blood in us, that is why we ensure to triple check the data. The people  like Dario from Briter  that we have worked with know how seriously we take accuracy. Therefore, we shall continue making reports and research briefs about the ecosystem.
 However, I would like to suggest that if youre looking to criticise a report or a research brief from Digest Africa, spend some time reading our methodology because not only do we put emphasis on accuracy, we are very transparent. That way, you wont be able to compare apples and oranges.
 Lastly, if we publish something about startups, we shall label its startups. However, for now, we are not comfortable with the definition for startups in the market. That is why we use early-stage and technology companies. Though, very soon  as we continue to study and understand the market  we shall confidently coin a definition or borrow one we believe is suited for our standards.

"How Michael Wilkerson turned a side hustle into Tugende
","Tugende, an asset-financing company in Uganda, is betting on a target group that many would dare not  Boda Boda drivers. Majority of them are the so-called bottom of the pyramid, informal and have no credit history.
 Yet, somehow, Michael Wilkerson and his team have managed to prove everyone wrong. In fact, after doing that, they are now considering diversifying into leasing cabs.
 Tugende started as a side hustle for Michael and his housemate Matt Brown. But now, it is one of the few companies to point at in Uganda’s still nascent fintech scene.
 In an interview, Michael delved into their history, what they are optimizing for, and future plans.
 The beginning
 Surprisingly, given Tugende is a finance company, Michael began as a journalist. He did an internship at the Daily Monitor newspaper in 2006, when he was 19. It was there that he ended up meeting Andrew Mwenda who later became their first angel investor.
 “At the time [i was at Daily Monitor], Andrew Mwenda was the political editor of the Monitor and the host of KFM’s Hot Seat,” Michael said. The two instantly became friends as Michael was looking for journalists to learn from.
 But, the relationship was two way. “I was also studying at Stanford University and Andrew was coming for a fellowship the following year,” Michael says. So, in turn, he also helped Mwenda to make preparations for his stay at Stanford.
 Michael left Uganda after his internship ended but soon returned. “I fell in love with Uganda and kept coming back,” he says. This time around, Mwenda had left the Daily Monitor and started his own publication, The Independent Magazine. In 2008, Michael did an internship at the Independent Magazine.
 After finishing his undergraduate degree, Michael returned for a year on a Fulbright research scholarship in 2009. That is when they started experimenting with the leasing of boda-bodas. “We started by just investing in some of our favorite drivers,” Michael says.
 Turning a side hustle into a business
 Initially, the whole thing started as a side project. Michael and his housemate, Matt Brown, who now sits on Tugende’s board, were only funding a few boda-boda drivers that they knew. “I bought 3 motorcycles in November 2009, and helped some of our favorite drivers.”.
 He says that the interest stemmed from the fact that the drivers they knew who owned the boda-bodas were able to make big gains. “One of them had been able to own a motorcycle instead of renting,” he said, “which really changed his life.”
 With no business plan or model, Michael and Matt decided to bet on people that they did not know beyond being their day to day get-around-town drivers. “[We] just knew that these guys were taking all the risk, therefore should be able to be their own boss,” Michael talks of how they arrived at the decision.
 Andrew Mwenda: first angel investor
 In June 2010, close to a year since they started, Michael caught up with Andrew Mwenda again. “I told him how well it was working,” he says. Adding that Mwenda “was really excited and told us to scale it up.”
 However, the duo  Matt and Michael  had no more capital available as they had used their savings to start. Even more, they were reinvesting any income they were generated.
 Luckily enough, they managed to convince Mwenda to chip in, though on a condition. “He agreed to invest but after registering the company properly,” says Michael. “Thats when we incorporated and the first incorporation certificate is dated October 2010 as ‘Own your own Boda Limited’.”
 That name has to go!
 In 2012, which was three years into running the company and two years after incorporating, the business was growing, very fast. Michael, therefore, decided to make it a full time growing business. Andrew also influenced the decision on focusing on the business.
 “He was the person who said that ‘you must not treat this just as a side project, you should figure out how to scale this up,” Michael said.
 In addition to that, they also started looking for money to grow.
 However, Michael says that one insignificant thing the original name, Own Your Own Boda seemed to be a deterring factor in raising funds. “It just confused people,” he said. They thus decided to change it to something easily understandable. Tugende Limited. “It became Tugende at the end of 2012,” Michael says.
 “Thats why today we say we are 6 years old. Because even though it started at the end of 2009, we were not really treating it as a full-time startup until mid-2012. And again, Tugende went into full effect in late 2012.”
 We just need the money
 Tugende has raised money at different stages. While many are obsessed about which round they are raising, Michael’s focus is survival. “I am not really good with these sort of categories of rounds,” he says. Adding that they “just did whatever we could to survive and to grow.”
 The first round  that many would refer to as the Series Seed  which they started in 2012 closed in 2013. They ended up raising a total of $300,000 in total funding.
 Like anyone fundraising, Tugende also had a “really hard time raising” according to Michael. “But we were able to cobble together a lot of small angel investors together and raise the money as soon as we could.”
 The seed round included quite a lot of angel investors and Michael says that it was harder to attract attention from larger investors because Tugende were so small. He also adds that “in 2012 in particular, people were not so excited about financial inclusion as they are now or asset finances.”
 Convertible Debt
 “There were two things that were different for us than for a lot of early-stage companies,” Michael pointed out. First, Tugende was raising both straight debt (loans), and convertible debt which could turn into equity at a later stage.
 Secondly, they were also getting investors to commit incrementally. “We did not have to wait until the round was full to receive the cash,” Michael said. They were transparent on terms with everyone who was getting into the round.
 “[We told everyone], ‘look we are all going to give you the same terms, so you dont have to worry about people getting a better or worse deal if you dont all sign and send the money on the same day’”, Michael said.
 Michael thinks this high-trust approach was complemented by the nature of the business as a social enterprise. “I think it is because we were always impact-focused,” he says. “We were not necessarily raising money from the people who would invest in an early stage tech startup that sells movie tickets, or some other thing where they are hoping to get 100 times their money back.”
 “Most of our people knew that there are these guys [Tugende customers] who can own their own business in 19 months and Tugende just needs capital to finance them and it will change their lives. So our investor base is obviously people who cared about the impact. “
 In 2014 and 2015, Tugende also raised another $780,000 in funding. “The majority of our fundraising in that round was debt,” Michael notes.
 According to him, they primarily need debt to finance their growth. Though at the same time, they are also “very cautious about keeping control of our direction, he says.” “We want to make sure that we control the strategic direction so that we don’t get pushed into something that is profit maximizing at the expense of our customers.”
 To show how much they are committed to debt, even the recently concluded $5 million from OPIC was a debt investment.
 That said, Michael explains that Tugende will look to raise equity from aligned investors at some point. “I think we will be raising equity in the near future,” he says, “but largely to anchor further debt.” This is because “you reach a certain point where lenders want you to have enough equity in the business to give them a cushion if you run into problems.”
 “So we need to raise more equity soon to allow us to go out and ask for bigger ones. So if we continue on the path we are on, we may not need a lot more equity, but we will always need tons of debt.”
 Growth and Expansion
 Currently, the Tugende team sits at just over 180, but, it is a moving target and the movement is only upwards, averaging close to 100% year on year growth. “I think we closed [last] year with about 120 and I think we closed 2016 with around 60, and 2015 with around 25 or 30,” Michael says.
 Whether that trend continues, he says, “will depend on how many branches we add versus how much growth in existing branches,”
 To date, Tugende has served over 14,000 clients. That is both active and the alumni who have already taken ownership. However, this number is rapidly going up. “We are getting 100-200 new applications a week,” Michael says.
 This demand is coming from all the corners of Uganda which have prompted them to open up offices in different parts of Uganda. Yet, this doesn’t seem to be enough. “We have 9 branches [but] we are looking to speed up that process,” Michael said.
 In addition to the Mbuya based headquarters, Tugende has branches in Bukoto (Kampala), Rubaga (Kampala), Mbarara, Lyantonde, Wobulenzi, Mbale, Masaka, Mukono, Igana and, Jinja.
 Although there’s growing demand from other East African countries, Michael says that he has his eyes fixated on Uganda. Though, he doesn’t rule out the possibility of expanding to countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and South Sudan.

"How to Establish a Sticky Startup Culture &#8211; a case study of DumaWorks
","Creating a “sticky,” or simply put – AWESOME – company culture is something we pride ourselves in having built at Duma Works. We’d like to share some of the tricks we learned along the way – what works and what doesn’t work – to build an outstanding company culture at your company.
 What is Duma Works company culture?
 We get a lot of clients who come to our office and tell us that they want us to help them hire a team that’s like ours. 🙂
 Most people who come to our office says it looks like a really fun place to work, but seems like everyone is working hard. It’s also not weird in the Duma Works office for someone from the Placement team to sit in Product space to discuss something new and exciting.
 How did we build a great company culture at Duma Works? It didn’t happen overnight, and there were definitely a lot of hiccups along the way!
 I’ve taken a minute to jot down some of the key learnings we’ve had at Duma Works when it comes to building an awesome company culture. Hopefully, this can help you – whether you’re running HR at a big company, or the founder/manager at a small company just getting set up.
 What didn’t work for us at the beginning re: Company Culture
 Aimless sticky notes
 When launching the startup, we had heard very much about “sticky note” culture and thought if we did all of our planning and brainstorming in the form of sticky notes, we would somehow inculcate that “lean startup” “agile” mentality.
 So what did we do?
 We set up an entire wall of sticky notes, outlining projects we needed to work on, and colour coordinated the sticky notes that all fell on one category. It was quite cute, but maybe not entirely effective.
 Because we hadn’t set up processes around where those sticky notes would go, how we would show progress over time, how we would ensure everything got done through work in progress limits, or how we would decide which ideas got put onto the sticky notes and which got discarded, the sticky notes sat on the wall as general guidelines, but did not serve a grander purpose.
 So, on one hand, every visitor who came to our office saw the wall of sticky notes and thought we were a cool startup doing “lean” things, and sticky notes gave decision making at the company a lot of transparency.
 But on the other hand, the sticky notes didn’t serve an active purpose in driving decision making or part of a larger, directed company culture.
 Lesson? Make sure your sticky notes have a purpose if you want them to be a part of your company culture.
 Unstructured “open” meetings
 Speaking of sticky notes. Where did all the ideas on the sticky notes come from? Team meetings. What did we do at team meetings? “Brainstorm.” We wanted to make sure everyone at the company (then about 3-5 people) had a say in the future of the company.
 The problem was that we did not give our brainstorms any structure. Typically, we would discuss a lot of good ideas we had, but not necessarily make sure those ideas were implemented.
 Lesson? When trying to create a company culture of openness and transparency, you need to make sure that openness and participation are structured to gain maximum output.
 One type of brainstorming
 In line with this unstructured meeting learnings, I think one of the biggest issues we had was that we only created structures for brainstorming that favoured extroverts. This was also one of the first things Linus changed when he came in as CTO.
 Our brainstorming process always involved speaking out loud, and therefore if there was anyone in the team who was less comfortable with public speaking, they would simply not participate.
 Lessons? If you want to create a culture of brainstorming, make sure you create a system around how to brainstorm that includes different methods to encourage participation from both introverts and extroverts.
 
 What worked for us to build an awesome company culture
 Company culture playbook
 In 2014, the Duma Company Culture began to take a more solid form.
 We did a great exercise where we identified key character traits of people on the team that we absolutely loved. We wrote these traits down on a whiteboard next to every member of the team, clustered the similar traits, and took a step back to see what we had come up with.
 We did the same exercise for the “less desirable” traits demonstrated by people on the team, wrote them down, clustered them, and took a step back.
 What we came up with became the foundation for the Duma Works Company Playbook, or “Bible” as we like to call it. 🙂
 Enforcing CORE VALUES consistently
 Now, there is one thing to have values and another thing to communicate them across the team and ensure people love them and accept them.
 What we did was to write down all the values and set up a meeting with the team to discuss how we arrived at them, and examples of times when these values could be demonstrated. ie. Placement Success Team has a difficult screening test to create for a software engineer. Here is when Oxytocin Junkie value would come up and someone from the Product Team could assist in the test creation and screening.
 We were a small team at the time, so it wasn’t too difficult to communicate these values across the team.
 As we grow, to make sure these core values are enforced, we’ve set up teaching moments and times to praise each other for living our core goals everyday.
 Specifically, we take time at our weekly team meetings to talk about our core values. It’s a really nice section of the meeting to talk about how someone on the team has lived this value. ie. “People kneading to Maureen for making sure I learned how to read a bicycle this year,” or “Mad Science to Allan for trying the new sales experiment this week,” or “Instigation to Barbara for officially launching our marketing department.” (Real life! Snaps, Barbs! ;))
 We also enforce our Core Values during our on-boarding process with new hires! Part of every new hire’s on-boarding includes going over the Company Bible and understanding what it means to live the company core values.
 Seems cheesy, but it gives people a clear understanding from the get-go what is expected of them in terms of participation and teamwork.
 Transparency
 Sticky Notes: Ok, we still do love sticky notes. BUT, these sticky notes now serve a purpose! We’ve now adopted a more structured approach to meetings. This means that we do put our ideas and strategies up on sticky notes, but they get funneled through a process on the wall to track their progress.
 We also use sticky notes during brainstorming, but instead of just writing down ideas we’ve discussed, the sticky notes serve as a place for people who are less inclined to speak out to write down their thoughts and then present them to the group. No more stage fright!
 If you come to our office, you will see it literally littered with sticky notes. It’s great because then people from any team can go check out what’s happening on another team at any point in time.
 It’s also a great opportunity to get involved and give some oxytocin in case someone sees they can add value to the process another team is working on.
 Board Room Level Insights: At Duma Works, we try to equip everyone at the company with an understanding of how companies work across all departments. We would love for Duma Works to IPO someday, and have everyone on the team go launch their own thing. 🙂
 Because of this, we’ve taken cues from the visionary team at Buffer, and tried to be as transparent as possible about new things happening at the company – even to things at a Board level.
 I think this is a risky move, chatting about investment, cash flow, etc., with your team, but it also helps people understand exactly where they stand, where the company is, and why leadership may be making certain decisions.
 Overall, this transparency (often gawked at in the Kenyan ecosystem) hasn’t backfired, and I think has encouraged our team to think about the company more broadly, and has helped management become a much more transparent process.
 
 CAREER Mapping
 One new thing we’ve been implementing at Duma Works is career mapping for everyone on the team.
 As Duma Works, we want to make sure no one at the company feels like they have hit their ceiling and then want to leave. The challenge is that not everyone has a clear way of identifying their own ceiling, and would just start feeling dissatisfied without a clear reason in mind.
 To avoid this, we’ve decided to give team members a guide on how to think about what their career goals are, and what skills they need to pick up along the way. This way, we can identify books, articles, groups, and mentors for them to get involved with, and continue growing and challenging themselves.
 We have meetings between managers and individuals on their team twice a month, and we’re going to begin discussing how career objectives and skills growth is going.
 I’m excited to see what the yields, but I’m quite confident. 🙂
 Semantics
 We say “we” more than “I” at Duma Works. We do this on purpose.
 We also don’t refer to our team as “staff,” we refer to them as “team.” Also on purpose.
 “Staff” just makes you think of a cog in the wheel…doesn’t it?
 Space
 Anyone who’s been to the Duma Works office will tell you about our amazing space. I’ll be honest, it is amazing.
 Was it expensive to set up? No! We designed our office ourselves, hired local fundis (carpenters) to design the furniture and cushions, and personally trekked out to River Road to buy the kitenge fabric ourselves (of course, followed by a delicious meal at Malindi Dishes).
 We designed the office space with collaboration in mind.
 We have an open layout with few closed rooms (for the super secret meetings ;)), bean bags, carpets to sit on, and balconies to get some fresh air at the scenic Adams Arcade.
 I think our space is conducive for creativity and collaboration, and I think the team will agree.
 Honestly, we spend most of our lives at the office, and we’d rather work in a place that is comfortable!
 Highlighting hobbies &amp; Passions
 Lastly! Speaking of designing the office space ourselves – I’ll disclose why this was easier for us. one of our Talent Acquisition team members, Shiphira is actually an interior designer by trade!
 At Duma Works, one of the things I love that we do is try to not only nurture the professional skills of our team, but also the hobbies.
 For example, Kevin from our Placement team is a cartoonist, and we sometimes use his cartoons on social media to highlight his passion.
 People are more than just the skills on their CVs (or Duma Works profiles!), and we like to acknowledge and appreciate that as much as possible. After all, people are so unique because of the intersections they have created for themselves in the world – intersections between theater and recruiting, between interior design and talent acquisition, between placement and cartooning…
 To encourage people to grow personally, during our weekly goal stand-ups, we discuss professional goals, but also review personal goals, and how close people are to achieving their targets. Things like bicycle riding, weight lifting, book writing, fashion designing…etc.
 In Summary
 Phew! Long article, but hopefully gave some cool insights into our awesome culture at Duma Works and the levels we’ve pulled to get us here.
 It’s not rocket science to develop a killer company culture at your company – regardless of the size. But it does take a focused development process, a well thought out communications strategy, and a smart implementation strategy so people feel like a part of something, and not just pawns in a corporate retention strategy game. 😉
 If you have any questions, want to chat about your recruiting process, or want to learn more about Duma Works, please visit our website dumaworks.com or reach out at  magic@dumaworks.com . I’m always happy to meet new people, exchange new ideas, and build new partnerships.
 Happy Hiring!

"Kenya&#8217;s agri-input supplier Sidai Africa closes $2.25M Series A
","There is a rising demand for food in Kenya because of a rapidly growing population, increased effects of climate change and rising urbanisation. The country’s food production will, therefore, need to grow by 75% by 2030, according to the Institute of Security Studies.
 This demand means that farmers in Kenya need to step up production, become more profitable and need the tools and knowledge to do that. The country’s current agricultural input market, according to Sidai Africa, is valued at $1 billion annually while the growing livestock industry, alone, is estimated to contribute $3.1billion to Kenya’s economy. The livestock population in Kenya is currently valued at US $4.4 billion and represents a vast potential market.
 Sidai Africa is looking to tap into that massive market by building a fully vertically-integrated system that supplies “quality livestock and crop inputs and training to farmers and pastoralists across Kenya”.
 The startup manufactures its own range of livestock products working through partnerships with livestock product manufacturers from across the globe. Once it receives the products, it then dispatches them to its stores, franchisees and other stockists. The goal of maintaining this network is to ensure that “farmers have access to quality products at all times.” However, Sidai recently introduced a motorbikes service which ensures that they also take care of the last mile delivery.
 Also read: Kenyas online marketplace AfricaSokoni raises $445k from an angel investor
 In the process of doing that, the startup has scored support from Devenish, a global farming and food company founded in 1952. Devenish has in return injected funding as part of a US $2.25 million investment into Sidai Africa’s Series A round. Though US $750,000 of that round came in as debt from Global Partnerships
 In an email to Digest Africa, Dr Christie Peacock CBE  Sidai Africa’s founder, pointed out that the startup will use the funding to expand its distribution network as well as the range of products it offers.
 “Devenish supplies Sidai with nutritional products and technical advice to ensure all Sidai’s feeds and mineral supplements are of a consistently high standard,” wrote Sidai Africa in their company press release. Adding that Devenish is “currently providing Sidai with strategic business advice, and nutritional and commercial expertise will provide a platform for growth”.
 This is not the first round of equity investment that Sidai Africa is raising. “We have raised equity before from AHL Venture Partners,” Dr Christie noted. The other backer that they have had is the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
 This investment from Devenish and Global Partnerships takes Sidai’s total funding  including debt and grants raised to date to US $20 million. “Sidai has raised a little over $20m in total, of which $9m has come from Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and about $3m from AHL Venture Partners in both debt and equity,” wrote Dr Christie.
 According to Sida Africa’s 2019 company profile, the company was founded in 2011 and currently has 11 stores, 87 franchisees, and sells through a further 1,500 stockists. It directly employs over 120 people and reaches over 300,000 farmers.

"Egyptian fintech startup XPay raises $250,000 in pre-seed funding round
","Egyptian fintech company XPay has secured $250,000 in pre-seed funding from two angel investors. This comes on the heels of an initial investment into the startup made by the country’s first fintech-focused investment company, EFG EV Fintech.
 XPay is currently part of the cohort participating in Startupbootcamp Fintech Cairo. Here, the company is engaging corporates and finance companies in a bid to get investment to further push its mission of offering cashless solutions to the Egyptian market.
 The startup plans to channel this latest cash towards growing the company. XPay is actively seeking local talent to partake in the company’s impending stage of development and community engagement.
 “We are recruiting visionaries who share our passion for creating tech-based solutions to everyday anxieties,” said XPay founder and CEO Dr. Mohamed AbdelMottaleb.
 The company harnesses the abundance of mobile technology in modern communities like universities, clubs, academic institutions and residential compounds by providing quick and easy automation of daily tasks and transactions.
 Dr. AbdelMottaleb said, “XPay was established to become the platform of choice for all members of the family – eliminating the stress of juggling numerous transactions, subscription and bill payments, payment methods and due dates. One platform to ease the unavoidable inconvenience of modern living.”
 Prior to this pre-seed funding round, the company caught the eye of the fintech-focused seed stage startup accelerator/VC fund EFG EV Fintech.
 Mahmoud El-Zohairy, the Managing Director of the accelerator and fund, commented, “We believe in the evolution of financial services and in empowering and supporting Egypt’s local talent poised to drive the next wave of fintech innovation.
 “XPay is a revolutionary electronic payment solution, backed by a very seasoned founder that allows closed communities to digitize payments and payment collection, while providing community members and management with a variety of value-added services along the way.”
 The company’s potential has not gone unnoticed at Startupbootcamp Fintech Cairo either.
 Ahmed Elsherif, Director of this arm of Startupbootcamp said, “It is a real pleasure for us to be working with XPay in providing access to an end-to-end suite of financial services and payment facilities for a multitude of communities and verticals within the economy.
 “Mohamed AbdelMottaleb has demonstrated that XPay has the potential to become a key player in Egypt’s financial inclusion; enabling access to financial products that will impact the lives and futures of Egyptians for generations to come.”
 According to Digest Africa data, in 2019 so far, there have been 25 venture funding deals in the financial services (including fintech) sector in Africa at the seed (including pre-seed), early and late venture stage surpassing the 18 deals at the same time last year.
 XPay is turning plenty of heads and this latest infusion of cash certainly will help the startup foster financial inclusion an ever-growing Egyptian market.

"These two law firms are at the forefront of technology in Uganda
","A robust technology and startup ecosystem is a product of an intersection of various players. Technology in Uganda is experiencing the same. Various players are coming together to build it one brick at a time. Yet, it is on rare occasions that we do get to know the value and input of some.
 This includes the law firms that build the legal foundation for these ecosystems.
 Most of the time, it is the VC firms, Angel Investors and financial institutions we get to know. You can cite an example of Silicon Valley. One is more likely to know Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a VC firm less than 9 years old than Cooley.
 Although a16z has a couple of notable startups under its portfolio, its track record can’t rival Cooley’s.
 Cooley, a Palo Alto-Headquartered law firm has Apple, Cisco, eBay, Facebook, Google/Alphabet, LinkedIn, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Snap, Twitter, Uber, Tesla, Space X, Nintendo and Sony  as some of its (current and former) notable clients.
 The same is happening in Uganda. Two law firms  Signum Advocates and Bowmans  are becoming the go-to legal partners for technology companies. Especially multinationals entering Uganda.
 In between them, they have Google, Mastercard, Eaton Towers, Jumia, Uber, Liquid Telecom, Stanbic Bank, Sauteez and others. It is a no-brainer that they can become the Cooleys of Uganda in the long-run.
 With a track record of over 100 years in South Africa, it is understandable for Bowmans. Plus, most of the clients they get in Uganda can be traced back to links with their South African parent firm. Given that multinationals entering in Africa use South Africa as the landing point.
 The above, coupled with a presence in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, it is easier for them to lure these companies. Thus, it is no surprise that they have worked with Google, Uber, Eaton Towers, MasterCard and more.
 But, it is a different story for Signum Advocates. Though Kenneth Muhangi, the MD, says that the firm has partners in several African countries, their operations are largely in Uganda.
 Founded in 2014, the firm recently made four years. Yet, it has Jumia Group Uganda and Liquid Telecom under its belt. The firm is also tasked with advising Stanbic Bank on digital banking.
 Kenneth credits this to the firms specialized knowledge in areas technology companies need.
 “We have a very specialized practice and I head the Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications department, (TMT), says Kenneth. “Clients choose us because of this specialization.
 A lecturer himself, Kenneth speaks confidently of their expertise and combined experience by the firm of 6 partners.
 In particular, I have written extensively on tech-related matters and I also teach the same, he pointed out. Adding that, I lecture at UCU and have conducted Tech related trainings to banks like Stanbic and Housing finance and to Uganda Law Society.”
 Last year, Signum Advocates held an Innovation Colloquium at Kampala Serena Hotel. According to the firm, this was the first of its kind in Uganda. The aim of the event was to introduce an infusion of the legal sector and Uganda’s fast growing ICT sector.”
 Similarly, Bowmans Uganda has a team of 3 dedicated to TMT. This includes one partner, Brian Kalule and two associates, Silver Kayondo and Brian Manyire.
 The firm also participated in Kampala Innovation Week in November last year. A move that can be looked at as the firm positioning itself at the centre of Uganda’s technology scene.
 They also organized a “Fintech in Africa” Conference last year. Though in South Africa, delegates from Uganda Communications Commission attended the event.
 Silver Kayondo also believes that they are able to attract the top companies and multinationals because of their team composition and speciality.
 “I believe the top tech companies choose Bowmans/AF Mpanga Advocates due to the specialization and diversity of our team, which enables us to render legal advice that is not only technically/legally sound but also makes commercial/business sense, says Silver Kayondo.
 “We are ranked in Tier 1 as Uganda’s leading law firm by international law ranking agencies like Chambers, and IFLR 1000.”
 Working with multinational companies comes with a lot of benefits. These may range from sharing of best practices to a better pay.

 For Bowmans, Silves cites the “development in knowledge and skills base due to the rigorous research undertaken while advising tech companies” as one of them.” He also pointed out “better pay, especially by the established Fortune 500 telecom companies” as well as “efficiency gains as a result of working on the latest technological developments.”
 For Kenneth, the “opportunity to be at the forefront of the fastest growing industry in Uganda &amp; the world” is everything his firm is gaining from all this.
 But, there are downsides to this trend too. For example, law firms of their calibre charge in the range of $100  $300 per hour for an associate. The amount could then go up by 2-3x for a partner. This is according to a person familiar with activities of law firms in Uganda. Though both Kenneth and Silver declined to divulge the details of how much they charge.
 This fee is definitely high for a typical Ugandan. Implying that the knowledge and good practices they are gaining from won’t trickle down.
 When asked if theres a possibility of them to launch pro bono services to cater for startups, both said yes. Yet, added that they have tried it with disappointing results. Though maintaining an optimist attitude towards giving it a try in the future.
 But, I doubt if this will be likely. Given that companies like Jumia and Uber are willing to write uninterrupted cheques.

"UPATED: Africa&#8217;s top 15 startup funding rounds for the first half of 2019 vs 2018
","Going by the first half of 2019, African startups are raising VC funding at an unprecedented rate. Unlike in the past where large venture capital funding rounds into the continent depended on a few companies  take an example of Jumia and Takealot  this year, not only are the sizes of the funding rounds going up but so is the number of startups that are raking in that funding.
 Using Digest Africa data, we have identified the 15 startups that led the funding board in H1 2019. We compared them to similar startups that led the funding board in H1 2018. In this particular list, per our methodology, we only included startups that are either headquartered in Africa, have Africa as their only/primary market or are incorporated in Africa. That is why we excluded companies like Branch International that others might include in their research.
 In summary, the first half (H1) of 2019, the top 15 VC funding rounds raised by African startups totaled to $286.3 million compared to $175.47 million in H1 2018 indicating a growth of 62%.

"TEF Entrepreneurs list out! Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda continue to dominate
","The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) has officially released the list of 1000 African entrepreneurs from across the continent that the program will support this year.
 According to TEF, more than 151,000 Africans from 114 countries worldwide applied to join the 4th cycle of The Tony Elumelu Foundation’s 10-year, $100 million Entrepreneurship Programme.
 However, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya have dominated the list with 258, 126 and 74 successful candidates respectively. A similar trend was seen last year where the three countries dominated in the same order.
 Previously, Tony Elumelu Foundation has been selecting only 1000 entrepreneurs. Yet this year, an additional 250 has been added due to sponsored by the foundations partners.
 The 2018 cohort includes an additional 250 entrepreneurs to the standard selection of 1,000 thanks to a $1,000,000 partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to support 200 entrepreneurs in conflict and fragile zones of Nigeria, a $200,000 agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to support 40 pan-African entrepreneurs; and a $50,000 partnership with Indorama (an Asian-based company with operations in West Africa) to support 10 Nigerians, TEF wrote.
 The selected companies will now under-go mentorship and preparation by the foundation before convening for the annual TEF forum in Lagos later this and finally receive a $5,000 seed investment to boost their programs.
 In the next nine months, the 2018 Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurs will be trained and mentored and will use the skills acquired to develop a business plan; after which they become eligible to receive $5,000* in seed capital to develop their business concepts, TEF said.
 The program was started in 2015 and so far has dispersed $15 million in direct funding to entrepreneurs and $5.8 million in Programme &amp; technology development and operations according to a statement from the Foundation.
 Earlier this year, Tony Elumelu, the founder of Tony Elumelu Foundation, was awarded “2017 Philanthropist of the Year” by Per Second News. The businessman has been also recognized amongst the people at the forefront of building Africa. Notably, he is credited with making the word Africapitalism mainstream.

"CDC backs TheBoardroom Africa with $2M in funding
","In a partnership to bring increased diversity to companies and organisations across Africa, CDC Group, the UK’s development finance institution, has announced that it will support TheBoardroom Africa (“TBR Africa”) with funding of £1.6m (~$2,065,760). CDC’s funding will boost TBR Africa’s aim to double female representation in Africa’s boardrooms by 2028.
 Only 14 per cent of board members in Africa are women despite recent research highlighting how women positively impact business outcomes.
 A recent Credit Suisse report found that companies, where women make up at least 15 per cent of senior managers, have more than 50 per cent higher profitability than those with under 10 per cent female representation. McKinsey also reported that margins were higher for those companies where at least a quarter of their board members are women.
 Founded in 2016, TBR Africa is improving women’s representation in African boardrooms through its unique pool of peer-endorsed female leaders from over 45 countries across the region. The company connects these female leaders with CEOs and board directors in search of diverse talent, and its work is enabled by partnerships with development finance institutions, private equity, venture capital funds among other institutions and corporations.
 Funding from CDC will enable TBR Africa to expand its membership and client base across key growth markets on the continent and support the development of its accredited board training and mentorship programs tailored to women in the African business community.

 Earlier this year, CDC launched its new Gender Strategy which is designed to improve women’s economic empowerment throughout its investment cycle. One of the key priorities of CDC’s strategy is supporting women’s leadership.
 CDC has committed to support the involvement of women in senior management among its portfolio companies, encourage board and investment committee diversity, and promote the visibility and voice of female business leaders in Africa and South Asia.
 In the last year, TBR Africa has successfully supported several board and investment committee placements for CDC investments including a major multinational bank as well MedAccess and the Africa Food Security Fund.
 Marcia Ashong, Founder and Executive Director of TheBoardroom Africa, comments:
 “TheBoardroom Africa’s pipeline of talent is driving a fundamental shift in the gender balance among leadership teams in businesses across Africa and beyond. We are proud to partner with CDC Group, one of the leading investors in Africa, as we work to expand our network and help more companies recognise that gender diversity has a real social and economic benefit to both business and society.”
 Jen Braswell, Director, Value Creation Strategies, CDC Group, said:
 “As CDC encourages the world’s investors to focus on Africa, we need excellent men and women to serve on the boards of local and international firms across the continent. Our partnership with TBR Africa has already begun helping us reach our commitment to promoting gender equality in corporate leadership.
 The funding we’re announcing today will help TBR Africa continue to provide us with outstanding candidates for our portfolio that we would not have otherwise found. We are very pleased with the placements that TBR Africa has helped us make so far – and we’re looking forward to more.”
 CDC’s funding for TBR Africa comes from a DFID-funded technical assistance programme designed to support high-quality projects that have a significant impact and compliment CDC’s investment portfolio.

"SafeBoda unveils new offices and logo
","Yesterday, SafeBoda unveiled its new offices and logo to the public. Before, the ride-hailing companys offices were in Kyebando, near the Bahai temple. But, they have now moved closer to town. Their new location is Plot 1 Bukoto Street in Kisementi. A few metres from Acacia Mall.
 Speaking to Maxime Dieudonne, a co-CEO, he told me that one of the reasons for relocating was to come nearer to town. This, they hope will help them attract and keep top talent. Especially engineers. It has been hard for people to join us after seeing the location of our previous offices, Maxime said.
 SafeBoda has its headquarters and all engineers in Uganda. Yet developers are synonymous with working late hours. Maxime believes the new office location will favour their late-working hours.
 Though maintaining their signature orange, the company switched logos. The old logo was the word SafeBoda in an oval. The new one looks like two intertwined opposite-facing helmets.
 Started three years ago, SafeBoda has become the average outgoing Ugandan darling. Judging by how many express their love through Twitter. It was also demonstrated by the number of people that turned up for the relaunch.

"&#8216;Made in Ethiopia&#8217; drones to be used to deliver medical supplies
","Last year, my grandfather saw a moving object in the sky while attending an Orthodox Christian religious event in Addis Ababa. He wondered and thought of it as a foreign country object carrying out intelligence activity.
 But, I told him that it is a filming drone taking an aerial shot of the event managed by someone in the ground.
 In the recent past, imported camera-carrying drones have become common in Ethiopia. It is now a usual thing to notice drones like the one my grandfather saw in the skies of Ethiopia.
 These are being used for various purposes; From filming concerts, documentaries, weddings, TV shows, and football matches in the capital Addis Ababa and other regional cities.
 For instance, young university students in iCog Labs  known for Artificial Intelligence research and product development  are working to build drones that can play football in the air. They aim to organize a drone football competition. They have before organized a Robots football cup.
 Theres also a growing interest in Ethiopias drone industry from external investors.
 In April this year, Astra Aviation  a Kenyan firm  announced that it is will set up a drone technology company in Ethiopia. The firm will provide drone cargo transport service and a drone technology training academy in partnership with an unnamed local firm.
 Astra will start with three cargo drones of various sizes that can deliver mails, parcels and also offer agricultural spray services. The company promised to launch its services before the end of 2018.

 But, aside from the imported ones, Ethiopians are also beginning to design and build their own drones. The technology scene in Ethiopia is having a moment and Initiatives to use locally developed drones is one of them.
 The main driver is the Ministry of Health, an institution led by one of the youngest ministers in Africa. Dr. Amir Aman, 33 years, is part of the new reformist cabinet that took office in March 2018 when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed rose to power.
 In August 2018, the ministry announced plans to use UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to deliver medical equipment and supplies to remote areas of Ethiopia. This would help to distribute medicine and blood supplies to areas where access to the road is hard and expensive.
 To achieve this, they are undertaking two separate projects; One with Ethiopian Ministry of Science &amp; Technology and another with Zipline  a California-based drone startup that has already done a similar project in Rwanda.
 With the Ministry of Science and technology, the agreement is to use drones with five kilograms of carrying capacity. While, with Zipline, they will use drones that can carry up to two kilograms.
 As a result, the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology has successfully launched its first drone in mid September 2018. The said drone will carry cargo weighing five kilograms and flying at 5,000m altitude.
 They also successfully tested a 5.6 KM range horizontal flight few days after that. The horizontal flight was a circular path with the same starting and ending point. The next testing is expected to be a long-range GPS guided autonomous flight from point A to B.
 
 “Since access to electricity even by health centers is low, storing vaccines in suitable environments has been unsustainable. Drones will be used to transport vaccines from proper storage areas to remote health centers, Dr. Amir Aman said to the local newspaper.
 
 The drones can fly up to 120 Km an hour and the Ministry is saying that they are ready to manufacture an additional 23 drones in the next six months.
 The ministry created a research and technology program by recruiting different talents from universities and schools and assembled 100 innovators for this project. This team did the full design of the drone and assembling. Though, some parts and engines are imported from China and US.
 Based on an agreement with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology is anticipated to sign a contract once the pilot project is deemed completely successful by the end of this year.
 Afterward, the Ministry of health plans to deliver medical supplies using 24 drones starting from January 2018. Six cities  Addis Ababa, Meqele, Hawasa, Jima, Dire Dewa, and Bahir Dar  will be dispatch centers. But, the drones will operate in an area that covers a 150 KM radius from each dispatch center.
 Despite the fact that other African countries like Rwanda, Tanzania, and Mali have used drone technology for medical cargo, Ethiopia will be the first to use a home designed and built drones ones.

"Recently Launched SulaPay Signs an Exclusive Partnership with Local Musician Maurice Kirya
","SulaPay, a recently launched Ugandan local Mobile Money payments solution startup has partnered with soul singer Maurice Kirya. The partnership will see the singer sell his recently released Free Dreams Album using the platform.
 In the official communication, SulaPay says that it has signed an exclusive partnership with Maurice Kirya and the new digital album will only be available on the startups platform.
 
 The Partnership is born out of the pure frustration that there are no innovative and easy ways creators and especially musicians can sell their products online, SulaPay said.

"Why your tech startup should really consider applying to YC&#8217;s Startup School
","It is no doubt Y Combinator is the worlds leading tech startup incubator. So, an opportunity for any tech startup to pass through their hands is one many relish. But, luckily enough, one has arrived in form of YCs startup school.
 The incubator recently announced the return of Startup School it introduced last year.
 We’re hosting Startup School again this year, Y Combinator announced. Adding that this is a free, 10-week, online course.
 The course is designed for any startup founder who would like to get help through the earliest, most difficult challenges of starting a company.
 It will begin on August 27, 2018, and applications are now open for those interested.
 But, why should one apply to Startup School?
 Well, there are some new things YC has bundled into its FREE Startup School this year. And, any tech founder should consider them.
 The Incubator will select 100 startups that it will deem to have performed well. These will receive equity free funding.
 For the first time ever we are going to give $10,000 in equity-free funding to 100 of the most promising companies that join and complete the course, YC wrote on their blog.
 Additionally, theyll also get access to YCs partner in form of an online interview. Those companies will also receive a video interview with a YC partner.
 This is something startups that could be looking to become YC graduates should consider. Because the partners will be giving advice and are likely to aid you in how to apply for future YC batches.
 Related: Take a look at these 14 Y Combinator graduates from Africa
 Beyond that, youll also get credit to a couple of services. YC pointed out that startups will receive over $50,000 in credits to a variety of other services, Digital Ocean, Amazon Web Services, and Clerky.
 This can reduce your overheads if youre currently using those services or plan to.
 If youre looking to work with Stripe at one point in your journey, this could also be an opportunity for you because they will be giving startups discounted payment processing and an invitation to Stripe Atlas to incorporate and open a company bank account.
 Last year, Startup School received over 13,000 applications according to Y Combinator and 95 YC alumni volunteered their time to advise over 2,800 of those companies participating across 141 countries.
 
 Throughout the 10 weeks, we watched founders build products, talk to users, create local communities, and launch their companies. 1,587 (56%) of the companies completed the course, and, since then, 38 of them have been accepted to the core Y Combinator program and received YC funding.

"Andrew Mwenda backed Tugende secures $5 Million in financing
","Tugende, a lease-to-own Ugandan startup, has received a $5 million loan from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).
 “The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has provided a $5 million loan to Tugende Limited,” OPIC wrote in their press release.
 According to the document which lays out the details of the loan, the proposed loan amount is $5,000,000 Million. However, the project costs are $6,667,000 and the loan period will last 5 years.
 This will be used for scaling both within Uganda and the East African region.
 “The business, which has grown with no advertising, will use the OPIC loan to scale up its successful operations in Uganda,” wrote OPIC.
 When you look at the details [PDF], it seems OPIC is offering the loan with the promise from the startup that they will take on more US labor, however small.
 “U.S. procurement associated with this Project is expected to have a small but positive impact on U.S. employment,” one of the reviews read.
 Perhaps that’s why the companies that secure similar forms of investment maintain offices in the US or go on to have much of their staff to be foreigners. For example M-Kopa, Fenix International and Tala.

 The document also lists Michael Wilkerson, the founder of Tugende, as the US sponsor  which in the startup language could mean the founder or shareholder.
 While it also lists Ugandan journalist and owner of the Independent, a Ugandan media house  Andrew Mwenda as the foreign investor.
 Tugende, on its website, lists Andrew Mwenda as the only black board member together with Matt Brown, Aaron Patillo and David Isroff.
 “He was the first investor in Tugende, a current board member and has provided extensive mentorship, connections and help to navigate Uganda’s bureaucracy,” part of Andrew’s bio on Tugende reads.
 Founded in 2013, the startup operates a lease-to-own model in which riders are given a boda-boda loan which they pay off with an interest.
 After clearing the loan, the ownership of the boda-boda is transferred to them. The loan term is usually over a period of 18 months.
 The company says that it currently has at least 150 employees and has served over 12,000 customers.

"Here&#8217;s 3 things you should know about Paystack from their SEC form D
","Paystack recently raised $8 million in a funding round that was led by Stripe with participation from Visa, Tencent as well as Y Combinator. The company then filed their Form D with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 According to Investopedia, Form D is a short notice, detailing basic information about the company for investors in the new issuance. Such information may include the size and date of the offering, along with names and addresses of a companys executive officers.
 This notice is in lieu of more traditional, lengthy reports when filing a non-exempt issuance. The form must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities. Several companies like M-Kopa and Flutterwave have also previously filed with the SEC.
 Below are a few things to know about Paystack from the SEC Form D it filed a few months ago;
 1. Incorporation
 The company was incorporated in Delaware three years ago in 2015, though headquartered in San Francisco. Theres been an increasing number of startups operating in Africa incorporating in Delaware or having the principal place of registration as Delaware.
 The company is incorporated in Delaware though headquartered in San Francisco. Theres been an increasing number of startups operating in Africa but incorporating in Delaware. Flutterwave and M-Kopa are also Delaware incorporated companies according to the SEC Form Ds.
 It is easy to conclude that perhaps either the investors are dictating where the startups are incorporated or the startup founders are doing it early on with the end goal of making it easier for them to raise capital from the US.
 SPONSORED: Find out how Unreasonable East Africa can support your business
 Given that over 80% of disclosed investors in Africa in 2017 were foreigners while 90% of the capital invested in the continent went to startups founded by at least one or more European or North American.
 Looking at the trend of incorporation, it is then safe to start using the term startups in Africa, rather than African startups or companies.
 2. Type of funding
 Though it is not clear how much Paystack gave away, on form D, the startup indicated that they had given away equity to the investors. The deal also had a combination of angel, VC, and other investors. There were 40 investors who participated in the round.
 3. Funding raised
 Paystack pointed out that they had raised $8 million from their Series A. However, the form D states that the payments startup put USD $10,205,002 for sale and all was bought. When we contacted Paystack, the company pointed out that the total amount raised was $8 million for the Series A.
 To clarify, $8M was raised during the recent Series A funding, which brings the monies raised since the inception of Paystack, including seed funding to $10.2M, wrote the Paystack team.
 The same can be realized when you look at Flutterwaves SEC D that it filed last year. The startup stated that it missed its target of $18,319,173 USD and instead raised $15,313,841 USD according to its Form D. But, they announced $10 million.
 This perhaps means that they filed for both the $1.3 million Seed round they raised in 2016 with the Series A at once. Additionally, they could have raised that amount in total but went on to give a commission to an agent that put the deal together.

"Africa&#8217;s Talking is working on an incubator for software engineers
","Africas Talking, a pan-African API platform, is working on an entrepreneur in residence incubator for software engineers under its AT Labs arm. This was revealed by Graham Muhanga, who is leading AT Labs, on his visit to Uganda two weeks ago.
 Some clients come and tell us, give us a solution, [but] we dont want to build [solutions], Graham said. Adding that we dont build client-facing applications. The company is, thus, deciding to partner with software engineers to address that.
 Though, the company had pointed it out as one of the projects they would double down on after raising $8.6 million from IFC and Orange Digital Ventures earlier this year. Though, it was referred to as Africas Talking Studio.
 
 AT studio is a space where we take in brilliant engineers and support them as they build tech products. They will sit with us in our office and we will provide them with support and mentorship, wrote Africas Talking on their blog.
 
 The program will see Africas Talking partner with a client to identify a local problem.
 There is a process where we identify a local challenge with our partners, Graham said. They then pair the challenge with the engineers(s) that have the necessary skills to solve it. Though, they will focus on using local engineers for each country.
 In Africa, the first thing we learned is that if you are in Uganda, hire Ugandans. If you are in Kenya, hire Kenyans, Graham noted. You will not see a Kenyan software engineer building a Ugandan solution.
 Also read: These are Africa’s top 15 funding rounds in 2018 (so far)
 To join, engineers can apply to join the AT Labs without having any problem they are looking to solve in mind. However, those who also have developed MVPs to a problem they have identified can also apply.
 Entrepreneurs in the incubation program will get a salary and access to all the day to day needs from Africas Talking.
 [Well] pay them a salary, hire for them, give them legal, give them business development, give them accountants and give them an office, said Graham. The only thing they do is to build that idea.
 Currently, AT Labs is only in Nairobi and under what you may call a probation phase with a focus on only six sectors. These are; Entertainment, Health, IoT and Fabrication, Payments, Infrastructure as a Service (cloud/hosting) and Education.
 SPONSORED: Find out how Unreasonable East Africa can support your business
 The companies currently under the program are; Duara (hosting), Alika (Entertainment), Fablab (makers space), Focus Mobile (customer management platform) and more.
 In exchange for the support to entrepreneurs, Africas Talking takes a stake in each venture. We take between 20% to 40% of these companies because we are giving you everything, Graham pointed out.
 Though, the program will be rolled out in countries where Africas Talking operates. Though, solutions that are scalable beyond their local market will, of course, be scaled into more countries where Africas Talking operates.
 Founded in 2010 in Nairobi, Africas Talking currently operates in 10 African countries. According to Grahams estimate, this number will likely triple to over 29 by close of 2019. The company is also integrated with a total of 25 telecom companies across Africa.
 It is thus looking to use the above as a value proposition to attract the engineers who want to start startups. The other value proposition is the ability of the ventures developed under AT Labs to leverage the ecosystem.
 We are building an ecosystem [and] want all the companies that come into the ecosystem to leverage from each other, Graham pointed out. For example, if you are building a hosting company, then all these companies can host on your platform.

","Last week, Ugandas Hindu Nabulumba made it to the finalist list for Africa Prize. This was because of, thanks to her, knowledge sharing innovation called Yaaka Digital Learning Network.
 In our conversation with Hindu, we were able to establish how she has been able to keep her startup afloat in an environment where startup death is part of the day to day activities.
 The aim of us approaching the Yaaka team was to comprehensively understand a couple of things. One of them was how they make money. According to Hindu, the startup is already making money.
 Yaaka makes money through selling Yaaka tablet computers that now go for UGx.1.4m, access of material is free of charge online but downloading you have to pay money as well as offline installation  Hindu Nabulumba
 The other critical issue that we wanted to understand was how the startup on-boards the teachers.  It turns out to be a helluva of a job. If one applies online, they are by default students. They have to again re-apply on the website (not linked because by the time of writing it was down) to become instructors.
 They are required to send in their profiles or CVs with recommendation letters. To ensure theyre real, the Yaaka team does a follow up.
 As of last month, the team estimates its student user-base at 35814  a figure we were unable to understand if it is the monthly average or overall since inception.
 When asked about what she plans to use the $10,000 that Yaaka recently won when they came in as runners-up at Africa Prize, she said theyll be focusing on pilots in schools.
 Majority of the startups funding has been through bootstrapping though  occasionally  they have had luck at winning grants and competitions. Some of them include the recently concluded ACIA, TEEP, and now Africa Prize by the Royal Academy of Engineering.
 From our opinion, Yaaka should focus on improving the website because  as highlighted above  by the time of writing this we were unable to access it.

"In Brief: Allianz X co-leads SafeBoda&#8217;s Series B with GO-JEK
","Allianz X, the digital investment unit of the Allianz Group, has announced an investment in SafeBoda, based in Kampala, Uganda. For the Series B investment, Allianz X is co-investing with Go-Ventures, a venture fund whose cornerstone investor is GO-JEK.
 The investment in SafeBoda is Allianz X’s first in an African-headquartered company. However, Allianz and GO-JEK are already partners in GO-JEK’s home market of Indonesia.
 There were no details regarding the size of the investment round. SafeBoda is known to be particularly secretive about their funding details. Last year, they raised a Series A that sources close to the deal informed Digest Africa it was around $1.1 million, though the startup declined to reveal the exact details.
 In the statement released by Allianz X, the firm described SafeBoda as a major African ride-hailing platform that also offers various on-demand consumer and payment services. This is largely because SafeBoda is looking to mirror what GO-JEK has done in Indonesia by transforming itself into a super app.

"Take a look at these 19 Y Combinator graduates from Africa
","Y Combinator  a startup incubator and accelerator  has had its interest in Africa peak in the past three years. At least judging by the statistics from the incubator itself. Check out here and here.
 In 2017, 28% of its batch came out of the US. But, this number has now climbed to 35% for this year. This is a reflection of how Silicon Valley is becoming accommodative of startups from outside  not only Silicon Valley itself but the US.
 For example, it has been three years since they started admitting startups operating in Africa or with African roots. Yet, the numbers are exploding.
 In my search for African startups that can be traced to having been a part of Y Combinator, I arrived at 19. Though this number could be higher.

 This was the very first batch and as usual, participants were in two batches; the winter and summer batches. Three startups graduated this first year. That’s Afrostream  which was largely focused on Francophone Africa, Saida based out of Nairobi and energy company, Oolu. Afrostream has since closed shop.
 2016: 5 Startups
 The number jumped to five. Thats OMG Digital from Ghana, Kuhustle from Kenya, Instabug from Egypt as well as Paystack and Flutterwave from Nigeria.
 Some of these have gone on to raise some significant amount of funding since then. OMG Digital raised US $1.1M, Instabug raised $1.7 million Seed round led by Accel, Flutterwave has raised at least $20 million while Paystack has raised over $10 million.

"Ugandan Ride Hailing Startup, SafeBoda, expands area of Operation
"," SafeBoda, a Ugandan ride hailing startup which started operations in 2015, has expanded to cover other parts of Kampala. This is to remain committed to its goal of ensuring boda rides in Uganda are safe. It is a safe and convenient boda boda transport service that brought innovation to the growing motorcycle taxi industry in Uganda and Africa.
 
 
  
 
 
 SafeBoda has been covering areas of Kampala Central Business District, Kamwokya, Kololo, Bukoto, Nakasero, parts of Ntinda, Jinja road and Naguru. It has since expanded operations to include the areas of Kisaasi, Makerere, Bugolobi, Kisugu, Kabalagala, Muyenga, Nsambya, Kansanga, Kyambogo, Mbuya, Nakawa and neighboring areas near them. 
 
 
 We are expanding our request area!! We have added parts of Makerere, Kisaasi, Kyambogo, Kisugu, Muyenga, Kabalagala Nsambya and Kansanga pic.twitter.com/2qxS3dzvKM
 — SafeBoda (@SafeBoda) March 2, 2017
 
 
  
 
 
 
 This comes after SafeBoda launching its new app on the 15th of February this year. So far, over 1000 downloads of the new app have been made since its launch. According to Damalie Wasukira, the Head of communications at SafeBoda, they’re migrating their riders to the new app  currently only available on Android. 
 
 
  
 
 
 With the new App, SafeBoda users should expect new and improved design that’s simple to use, fair and transparent prices removing the back and forth of bargaining with the riders, riders arriving within minutes and so much more.
 
 
 
 
  
 The new SafeBoda App outlook
 
 
 
 So far 150 rides are ordered per day using the new app and only 50 riders are currently using the new app. This is a small number given that SafeBoda has over 1200 riders in its portfolio to which Damalie also agrees. She attributes this to the huge work involved in training the riders on how to use the new app. Each of the 50 riders is currently making an average of UGx. 45,000 per day – which is within the average range of 30,000 – 50,000 made by other non – SafeBoda riders operating in the same areas. 
 
 
  
 
 
 SafeBoda riders can be identified by their orange reflector jackets that bear their names at the back; they also carry two helmets, one for the rider and one for the passenger. Each rider has a unique identification number on the helmets and also carries disposable hair/head caps for passengers to ensure hygiene. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Asked about their expansion plans, Damalie confirmed that it’s in plan to cover the entire Kampala by end of 2017 and embark on expanding to other cities and towns like Jinja, Entebbe etc. Currently, their rider database is growing by 5-10 riders per week despite the fact they are not doing active recruitment. She said that there are plans to kick off recruitment of riders in the next quarter till the end of the year.
 
 
  
 
 
 For one to become a safeboda rider, they are required to part with a one-time membership fee of UGx. 200,000, must have at least 3 years of riding experience and belong to a boda boda stage. They’re therefore required to come with a letter from the boda boda stage chairman confirming their membership. The other thing they must carry is a letter from a next of kin for identification purposes.
 
 
  
 
 
 Yet, the benefits are immense as they get access to low cost insurance cover with their families. This is possible through the partnership established between SafeBoda and BIMA Insurance. So, riders interested in the program have to part with between UGx. 25,000 – 30,000 a month. The rider also get two helmets and an orange reflector jacket. Those without permits get helped in the process given the existing working relationship between SafeBoda and Uganda police.
 
 
  
 
 
 SafeBoda currently has a staff of over 40 people. It also has several partnerships helping it to navigate the tough business climate in Uganda. Some of them are already active while others are a work in progress. Partners include BIMA Insurance, Red Cross, MTN Uganda and Makerere University. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Safeboda is backed by Harold Mechelynck (Founder of Ogone), Global Innovation Fund, USAID Development Innovation Ventures and Shell Foundation. Apart from Global Innovation Fund, which invested £160,000, other investment details remain undisclosed as SafeBoda declined to make a comment.

"Everything to know about Hive Colab&#8217;s expansion to Mbarara district
","Hive Colab is expanding its physical presence beyond Kampala. Barbara Birungi, a director at Hive Colab, confirmed this. The Kanjokya street located hub was the first tech hub in Uganda. Founded in 2010, this move will make it again the first hub to have a presence in more than one Ugandan district.
 
  
 
 
 The hub has had a virtual incubation program in place. Where they have supported various innovators unable to access their services in Kampala. As Barbara pointed out, theyre already supporting 15 innovations through our virtual incubation. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Yet, this move will ensure those ventures can also tap into the hubs other amenities. Barbara says, they will be able to offer a wider range of services and support. This will ensure that they succeed, from ideation to market launch.
 
 
  
 
 
 Hive Colab has had a virtual incubation program for the last 3 years. We support innovators from around the country who cannot access our physical space. The services have been the same. The only difference is; we do not offer a co-working space with its amenities.
 
 
  
 
 
 Mbarara is one of the leading towns in the country when it comes to innovation. At the concluded MTN Innovation Awards, some nominees were from the district. The group with a flying airplane prototype. (See also: 
 
 
  
 
 
 Another group is that of iDrain that were part of the Up Accelerate program by Outbox hub. (See all: Here’s What Up Accelerate Startups Learned and the Challenges they Faced)
 
 
  
 
 
 
 We have been studying the potential of innovation in Mbarara region. Many potential innovators are from the universities in the region. They have support while at university, but once they leave, it becomes very difficult. You also find that those who cant make it to Kampala will not build their innovations beyond the first year, Barbara added.
 
 
 
 There are already stakeholders that have set up shop in the district. And, Hive Colab would like to work with them too.
 
 
  
 
 
 We want to closely collaborate with MUST and other universities in the region. To support innovation that will lead to social and economic development. We also hope to work with UCC, URSB and other concerned government agencies, Barbara said. 
 
 
  
 
 
 But, the need to set up a facility that these entrepreneurs can call home is one of the reasons. Apart from CAMTech, theres no innovator dedicated-facility in the district. 
 
 
  
 
 
 They need a place that can nurture them  through training, technical and business support, hold them accountable and provide access to different stakeholders like investors, government and private sector to allow them to grow, Barbara Birungi pointed out.
 
 
  
 
 
 The model of operation will be like the one in Kampala. Itll look at innovators on an individual basis. And the pricing will be done according to the capacity of the startup or individual. Though the hub, according to Baraba, will also run a freemium model. This will be for a limited period of time as one goes through some of our programs.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 If one is a member of any branch, they will have access to all branches at no extra cost. A startup in Kampala that wishes to do business in Mbarara will have access to that hub and any support we will have gathered for those innovators.
 
 
 
 Yet Hive Colab is making this expansion at a time when some are criticizing the hub model. They say it has failed to help build notable and sustainable African ventures. They are doubting what hubs are bringing to the table. Except for a fancy working area, secure and faster internet and events. The majority of the hubs, not only in Uganda, arent self-sustaining. They are heavily subsidized by donations. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Hive Colab is part of AfriLabs, a network of over 60 hubs across the African continent. It also partners with hubs including iHub, Mlab, and Nailab in Kenya, Bongo Hive in Zambia, 1776 in the US and Dubai, and OpenGov Hub in Washington DC. Until this new branch, TechBuzz  located on Najim Mall, in Ntinda  was still the newest hub in Uganda.

"Silicon Valley: Invest in Africa, But Do It Differently
","I was raised in an American farm town. My perceptions of Africa were a mix between the gruesomeness of Hotel Rwanda and the fantastical backdrop of Disney’s Lion King. To me, it was a wildland without structure and organization, and it scared me enough to want to stay far away. Then one day a funny thing happened: I moved there.
 My first day on the continent was spent dancing with families draped in white sheema cloth and being fed directly by the hand of a new friend in a gesture to show friendship and love, called gorsha.
 As my year of travel unfolded, the old perceptions of Africa dissolved. In their place were the realizations of sheer depth, variety, and opportunity of the continent — it was awesome.
 I saw humanity’s greatest qualities in action: efficiency in the motorbike driver loading mom, dad, grandma, baby and a bundle of live chickens precariously on the back of his load. Ingenuity, like a broken bus axle swiftly replaced with a freshly harvested tree. Vigorous entrepreneurialism from the street-corner hustler hawking everything from a toilet seat to Beyonce’s new album. I also saw a general open-mindedness and an earnest adoption of technology and 21st-century services, suggesting that Africa is rapidly beckoning to the future. The Africa I know is not what you might think.
 With an anticipated 3% GDP growth rate in 2016, 65% year-over-year increase in foreign direct investment, the youngest population on the planet with a median age of 19 years and an estimated $1 trillion in consumer spending by 2020, Africa is open for business.
 Technological advancement, in particular, puts Africa squarely in the sights of the global investment community. Africa is closing in on 1 billion mobile phone subscribers and its internet usage rate is growing at seven times the world’s average.
 Also read: Silicon Valley investors should bet on Africa’s potential not exit history
 Yes, a growing patchwork of entrepreneurs, startups, and innovation centers are coalescing country to country, but the tech ecosystem is in its relative infancy. And while the headline-grabbing stats on Africa’s opportunity are legitimate, they must be understood in context. The continent’s transformation does not mean that easy or outsized returns are just there for the picking. For Silicon Valley, an investment paradigm shift is essential.
 Interested? Here are four things Silicon Valley must do to win big in Africa.
 Target investments that nurture talent and build infrastructure
 Silicon Valley prizes top talent. Its success stories all started by deploying the right human capital at the right problem, at the right time. The African recipe is no different, except for one thing: talent is scarce.
 Founders may lack formal employment experience, leaving a gap in professional, social, and problem-solving skills. Poor education levels mean that a workforce may be not equipped with technical skills and likely lacks perspective into applications and global best practices; this includes those with college degrees.
 Critical business management and interpersonal skills are at a premium. Business management, leadership, and technical skills are all highly sought and retaining talent in an environment where employees don’t trust the value of stock options and will switch jobs for a $500 annual salary bump are founders’ key struggles.
 For investors to reap the benefit of African-born startup growth, investment needs to be directed toward talent producing engines. One example, Andela, sources local talent, screened on their ability to problem-solve and think creatively. The company drives them through rigorous technical leadership and training program, then mobilizes and integrates the talent back into technology companies.
 The impossibly pent-up ecosystem demand for talent means revenue for Andela, while their model serves as a mechanism to build the tech marketplace and capitalize on an under-employed millennial workforce.
 If talent is the prized internal resource, then infrastructure is its external equivalent. Africa’s infrastructure limitations present operational challenges, but also affect customer experiences and stymie go-to-market strategies. The World Bank suggests that poor infrastructure curbs business productivity by 40%.
 Protracted outages, exorbitantly priced power, unreliable network access and a general, political reluctance toward infrastructure spending means startups are battling environmental hurdles alongside the already challenging marketplace.
 How many pitches have you heard over coffee at Starbucks? Now, what if those meetings required a two-hour commute each way through snarled Lagos traffic? What if your star developer couldn’t join the team because two-year prepaid rent requirements prompted by a housing shortage were financially prohibitive?
 While sometimes frustrating, infrastructure limitations do present opportunities for savvy investors. Fairwaves, for example, has launched a shoebox-sized device that seamlessly integrates with existing mobile operator networks to deliver network signals to mobile phones. Costing up to ten times less than traditional network solutions, Fairwave’s products make reliable, rural mobile coverage profitable and establish a mobile network to enable developers to build rich mobile applications for those networks.
 This type of technology benefits the entire consumer value chain, from entrepreneurs to operators and customers. Operators’ reach extends to a previously unserved customer base while lowering the cost base of the network as a whole. Customers receive reliable mobile network access and entrepreneurs can capitalize on the opportunity to build applications which are integrated into the network while leveraging the operator’s investment in billing and distribution.
 Mobilize local capital
 Despite strong macro signals, the local SME startup community starves for capital. While investors wait for the bellwether exit or acquisition to signal that the industry has matured enough for them to get in the game.
 The African tech community needs active local investors — and with Africa having the fastest growing high net worth individual market in the world, building an angel investor network seems obvious. But, these potential angels are wary of the risks and potential returns of investing in local tech and instead look to move their new-found wealth offshore.
 Silicon Valley can lead the way by committing resources to invest alongside local investors as a vote of confidence and a tool to build knowledge for the African investment community.
 But this isn’t about mercenary capital, or knowingly burning cash just to catalyze the market. Silicon Valley needs local investors to act as guides. They know what you don’t about market idiosyncrasies. They understand that Ngozi uses his cousin to make purchases because he doesn’t know how to order online. They know that Gbenga makes calls home at 2 AM to save money on airtime, rather than pay for peak rates which are marginally more expensive.
 They also realize that Jimoh won’t pay electronically for goods because he instinctively distrusts transactions online and the merchant to deliver. There is, therefore, a clear need for symbiotic relationships where the Valley commits resources and expertise. While the local investors provide the contextual, nuanced perspectives that will make or break deals.
 Stop ‘saving Africa’
 Global tech companies are serious about Africa. Last year Facebook opened its first Sub-Saharan Africa office and SAP is investing $500 million through 2020 to introduce its technologies across the continent. And yet mention African investment and the global venture community assumes a modest posture.
 Tolerating lower returns, trumpeting social value and softening expectations on business, process and management rigor does a disservice to the community. To be fair, the intent is genuine. People want to see African-born companies succeed. But well-meaning remote mentors, incubators and even the press, petrified of irreparably damaging the psyches of what they see as a fragile entrepreneurial community may do more harm than good.
 Investors need to move past the “made-for-Africa” mindset that has led to the acceptance of sub-par platforms; non-viable business models need to die. Accepting inferiority, regardless of the product or process in question, stunts Africa’s growth. When investors give mediocre African businesses and leaders a pass, they keep the community from learning the lessons that will ultimately seed its success.
 Massive global revenue generation potential and major exit opportunities are real. But low expectations condition the tech community to settle. Active investors must be willing to sit across the table from their portfolio companies’ founders — whether from Europe, the US or Africa — and discuss target benchmarks, systems improvements and effective execution irrespective of their local geography.
 Invest differently
 Boil Silicon Valley’s investment approach down and you get this: ride the momentum and look for a few big hits. Of course, they also know that the potential of any one company exploding is small. But spread the wealth and hit the next Google, and you just need one.
 Africa presents a thornier challenge. The investor landscape isn’t as dense and in many cases talent isn’t as mature. Investors will most likely be on the hook for future funding rounds, necessitating a level of hands-on commitment and oversight not seen in more mature markets.
 The ecosystem realities that VCs have come to expect in Palo Alto, Seattle or New York are luxuries in Africa. Communities are competitive, not cohesive. There isn’t a preponderance of superstar technical founders. Administrative underpinnings of a company — HR or legal activities, for example, may be entirely ignored. The odds may scare some off.
 But these risks get priced in ways not seen in developed markets. For the ambitious few who are willing to labor alongside founders and co-invest and partner locally, the upside is enormous.
 The rise of the tech-enabled, digital economy is underway in Africa, and Silicon Valley has a role. This isn’t obligatory nor a passing fad or distraction. This is a chance to shape and capitalize on the world’s final frontier market, but it needs to be done right to realize returns.
 After that first trip to Africa, I knew this would become my home. Since then, I’ve worked hard to understand the complexities of the continent and to capitalize on opportunities across the investment landscape.
 At Singularity Investments, we are taking advantage scalable opportunities in the digital and technology infrastructure space in Africa. We recognize the benefits born out of working with global partners to develop a local tech ecosystem, which benefits both investors and businesses. The time is right to expand efforts between our communities, and dialogue at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit is the perfect first step.

"Blockchain experimentation highest in Kenya, Nigeria &#038; South Africa &#8211; Report
","As the globe gets much more connected, there is the need to improve processes and drive efficiency. In a recently released report, Liquid Telecom examined the opportunity that blockchain presents in improving transparency and trust across Africa.
 Titled The African Blockchain Report 2018, the report notes that innovation is on the rise across Africa especially in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and South Africa. These are among the countries taking the lead in blockchain experimentation.
 It also details the pioneers of blockchain across the continent. This is in addition to highlighting potential use cases and applications, as well as exposing the challenges that await those looking to adopt the technology.
 The report also breaks down the industries driving blockchain adoption across the region, and how the technology can support them. Additionally, it looks at how key stakeholders in Africa are preparing for its arrival.

 It further indicates the technologys relevance to Africa in its bid to overcome trade finance and cross-border payment issues.
 Blockchain offers value in areas such as identity management, transaction records, cross-border trade and SME payments, it states.
 The Activity
 Without a doubt, the blockchain technology is still new across the continent. However, the majority of stakeholders do not underlook its future. This is especially in empowering trust within communities and public sectors such as the financial sector.
 In Kenya, a task force is in place to leverage blockchain with the primary objective of creating employment. The team is headed by Dr. Bitange Ndemo, who believes that the technology will impact over the next half-decade.
 In Uganda, the Blockchain Association of Uganda was set up as a credible vehicle for driving standards across industries in Uganda. The organization also aims to make resources available to government and public-sector consumers.
 Nigeria is not any different in her pursuit of blockchain adoption. Mid this year, Paxful  a peer-to-peer marketplace  announced plans to establish an incubator hub in Lagos.

 The idea is to provide a co-working space, mentorship, corporate and individual training, and networking for ICO advisors.
 South Africa has exhibited the technology through the Reserve Banks Project Khokha. This is an initiative that seeks to provide a distributed ledger technology-based wholesale payment system.
 According to the project, the typical daily volume of the payments system could be processed in less than two hours with the payment fully confidential.
 South Africa’s education space is also already benefiting from blockchain, through the Amply project, run by local blockchain venture production studio TrustLab and Swiss nonprofit ixo Foundation, funded by Unicef, notes the report.

"East African fintechs raised $462 million from 2010 to 2017, Fintreks report
","
 A report [PDF] by Intellecap says FinTechs in East Africa raised USD 462 million from 2010 to 2017. Dubbed Fintreks, the report traced back the evolution of FinTech in East Africa. The report also covered various players in the ecosystem. Over 150 FinTech companies and investors participated in the research for the report.
 According to the report, 2017 saw East African fintechs raise over USD 202.1 Million. Which is a 338% year on year growth. It bases its figures on Crunchbase, Intellecap Analysis and other sources.
 
 
 But, the report doesnt give a break down per country. Though, based on another graph of regional investment in East Africa, Kenya is ahead. East Africa is leading when it comes to investing in fintechs operating in East Africa.
 Also read: Uganda tech startups raise USD 16 Million, as Africa hits a record USD 560 Million
 Investment from East Africa into East African fintechs was USD $206.4 million from 2010 to 2017. Yet, USD 203.5 million, over 98% of that went into Kenya. The report says that the amount [of USD 203.5 million] raised represented over 28% of all the investments to FinTechs in the period.
 
 Ugandan fintechs raised $1.9 million. Followed by Rwanda and Tanzania with $0.2 million and $0.8 million raised.
 Kenya has an upper hand because most East Africa focused funds have their head office in the country. Thus, this local presence makes them feel comfortable investing. Because of a physical presence as they have local expertise in deploying capital.
 Ethiopian-based FinTech companies raised no funding between 2010 and 2017. Attributing this to the tough regulatory environment in the country. As for Rwanda, investors shun it because of its low market potential.
 For Uganda and Tanzania, there was no explanation. But, it is likely to be between lower market potential and tougher regulations.
 For Uganda and Tanzania, there was no explanation. But, it is likely to be between lower market potential and tougher regulations.
 Important to note is that 55% of startup investment from 2010 to 2017 went to FinTechs established outside of East Africa.
 Investors note that local FinTechs lack innovative business models and thus those established outside of the East African region tend to raise more funding than their locally-established counterparts, the report says.
 This is despite the fact that 58% of all the FinTechs are established within the East African region.
 
 45% of all investments made into FinTechs in East Africa in the past seven years originated from North America. With 95% of the funding coming from the U.S.
 The U.S.’s venture capitalists and private foundations dominated the deals closed in the region in the past seven years; raising over $240 million. These include Institutional Venture Partners, IFC Venture Capital Group, Overseas Private Investment Corp, Greycroft Partners, DBL investors, Calvert Foundation and Emerson Collective.
 Europe was also a popular source of funding among FinTechs in the past seven years. Having contributed to 30% of all funding raised.
 
 Recently, there are questions raised on which publisher or figures to trust or quote. While as this report puts the figure of funding raised by fintechs in 2017 at USD 202.1 Million, a recently released report by Partech Ventures puts the total funding by all fintechs across Africa at USD 119 Million for 2017. Another by Disrupt Africa puts the entire amount of funding raised by all tech startups in Africa at USD US 195.
 The main challenge here is the method and scope used by each of the publications. For example, under the Fintrek report, M-Kopa is a fintech. Though, the company can pass for Off-Grid Tech under the Partech report.
 The Fintrek report defines fintechs as firms leveraging technology to deliver financial products/services or capabilities to customers or other financial services firms.
 Most, if not all, Off-Grid tech have that element underneath their business model. Harmonizing the methods will save all interested in the findings the current confusion.
 The report explores other areas like fintech challenges, enablers, investment opportunities the ecosystem in East Africa and its future.
 In the annexe, it also highlights some of the recent FinTech deals in East Africa. M-Kopas USD 80 Million is the most outstanding. It also points out the key partnerships leading fintechs have forged in the region. The outstanding one is that of PesaLink. They have partnered with over 30 commercial banks.

"Two Ugandan law firms have partnered to launch a tech hub in Kampala
","Two Ugandan law firms are coming together with Techcellerate Limited to launch a new tech hub in Kampala. Called The Tech Hub Technology Incubator. The new hub is located in the central business district of the capital, Kampala.
 It is looking to offer co-working space, business incubation, acceleration as well as legal support.
 
 “The focus of the hub is small businesses (start-up and existing) that have technologies of potential interest to the digitization of Uganda and the greater Africa.
 
 They are also looking at offering a “fully integrated solution based on a needs assessment in terms of legal, regulatory and compliance. Something Silver Kayondo, the Managing Partner at Ortus LLP thinks will set them apart.
 According to a recent report by GSMA, Uganda has close to 20 hubs and co-working spaces. But, Silver thinks it still makes business sense to come into the market. (See also: There are 442 active tech hubs in Africa, GSMA 2018 report)
 “We want to provide a space which is housed within our firm to harness the synergies,” he wrote in a WhatsApp message.

 “Magic circle firms such as Clifford Chance in the UK have partnered with institutions like Barclays Bank to create hubs. Beyond fintech, agritech, insurtech, etc, we also want to shape some of the emerging trends in legal tech and improved methods of legal services delivery.”
 Ortus LLP and KTA Advocates, both newly formed, are branding themselves as the go-to law firms regarding technology and innovation.
 Silver Kayondo, a co-founder of DroneNerds, formed Ortus after leaving Bowmans Uganda. While KTA Advocates was formed by dissolving Karuhanga Tabaro and Advocates. Adding Kenneth Muhangi, who, before, was the Managing Director at Signum Advocates.
 While Techcellerate was founded by Ron Kawamara, Timothy Mugume &amp; Kenneth Muhangi.

 Ron Kawamara works for Jumia Group in East Africa. First, he was the MD of the Group in Uganda. While currently, he is the Managing Director of Jumia Food and Travel East Africa.
 Timothy Mugume currently serves as the Country Manager of Jumia Travel in Uganda. The trio hopes to draw from their experiences to support the startups.
 To kickstart their journey, the hub will host the HiiL Justice event tomorrow.

"Uganda&#8217;s Yammzit re-launches, to face it rough against Facebook with some features
","
 Yammzit has today relaunched with a new logo as well as a host of new features. The startup was first launched in November 2016. Co-founders Steven Byamugisha and Kevin Gasta made the announcements at The Innovation Village.
 
 
  
 
 
 At first, Yammzit launched a social review and rating platform. But with the relaunch, they seem to be moving away from that. They are looking to become an everything-lifestyle platform. 
 
 
  
 
 
 In the announcement, they said that it maintained its review and rating feature. Though, also introduced a host of others. Some of them include the Contacts, Discover, Happy Vibes, Yam Events and ShowTimes.
 
 
  
 
 
 They also announced, support features including YamPay and Yammzit Workspace. YamPay, integrated with Mobile Money, helps one make payments within Yammzit. Yammzit Workspaces helps businesses keep track of their activities in Yammzit.
 
 
 Reviews and ratings
 
 
 Last night, I went out with a friend to a wonderful place. They liked the Pizza and decided to review the place. Guess where they went? Facebook. But before doing that, they wondered when they had last used Swarm. Another review platform.
 
 
  
 
 
 Trust is at the core of reviews and ratings. If I dont trust you, then I wont trust your review. By default, we trust our peers hence their reviews. By Facebook having reviews and your friends, it becomes easier to lure reviews. 
 
 
  
 
 
 On Yammzit, you have to see reviews from both your connections on Yammzit and other people. This feature is competing with Facebook. A position not good for a startup to be in. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The only way Yammzit can become so good at this area is to ensure people trust their reviews. One way of doing that is focusing on niches like bars and restaurants.
 
 
 Discover
 
 
 Again, when it comes to discovering new places, Google and Facebook are always on standby. Waiting for you to think of whatever you want.
 
 
  
 
 
 One of the first things small businesses do is set-up a Facebook page. Because it is easier to set-up and maintain a Facebook page compared to a website. Plus, the cost of setting up and maintaining a Facebook page is far less than the ROI you get out of the platform.
 
 
 
 Reviews and Ratings are the first things youll see
 
 
 This is all possible because of the numbers Facebook boasts. Try typing in your Facebook search bar the sentence Bars in. It will auto-suggest high profile bars in the places around you. For example, mine auto-suggested Bars in Kololo and Bars in Bugolobi.
 
 
  
 
 
 Facebook also puts reviews and ratings as the first thing on pages for bars and hangout places. Unlike other Facebook pages. Good luck beating them on that.
 
 
 Contacts
 
 
 Contacts is another feature that Yammzit is introducing. This will allow users to identify contacts for the businesses and reach out to them. But, Facebook  again  is light years ahead in this area.
 
 
  
 
 
 The screenshot above shows that Facebook prioritizes reviews and ratings. After that, the next priority is to contact the business after deciding whether you like it or not.
 
 
  
 
 
 Once again, thanks to numbers, a business has a better incentive to display its most up-to-date contacts on Facebook than Yammzit. 
 
 
 Happy Vibes
 
 
 This feature wants Yammzit users to take advantage Happy Hours at hangouts. It will allow them to book for their Happy Hour drinks or items and go their later as long as it is before midnight.
 
 
  
 
 
 Steven pointed that they so far have clubs Atmosphere and Arena as well as La Patisserie  a restaurant.
 
 This is a wonderful feature. As long as Yammzit is able to show how it will impact business bottom line. Because they intend to make money out of it through the revenue share with the businesses. Then, it is a no-brainer itwill take off.
 
 
 Yam Events
 
 
 This is for people who only want to see events related to certain topics. It also aims at helping businesses keep track of their ticket sales and event sign-ups. Steven maintains that all ticket sales and sign-ins at events will be digital.
 
 
  
 
 
 So, once you pay or sign up for an event, youll get an e-Ticket or e-Receipt. Then, when you go to the reception or gate for the event, the receptionist or usher will scan the QR Code on your ticket.
 
 
  
 
 
 This is a wonderful product. Itll help ease the amount of paperwork among event goers and organizers. Though, in my view, it is not scalable to handle larger volumes of people. Thus suitable for events with smaller attendees. These people should also have smartphones. Tech event organizers should be the first customers.
 
 
  
 
 
 I also think that companies can use it at their receptions. Instead of a visitors book, why not scan a QR Code that has a form for me to fill in and access your building or office?
 
 
 ShowTime
 
 
 Here comes my favourite feature launched. Its solving one of the most recent challenges I faced.
 
 
  
 
 
 On Saturday, I was travelling from Kenya but had to watch Black Panther with my date. Yet, the only way for me to know the times when the movie was showing was to go to the Facebook page or Website for Cinemax.
 
 
  
 
 
 Then, I could only make a booking through mobile money after calling in for a reservation. This doesnt guarantee me a receipt in return. The alternative we took was to send someone to go and book the tickets.
 
 
  
 
 
 What ShowTime is presenting is the ability for one to know which movies are showing. And, at what time of the day or week. Then go ahead and book. 
 
 
  
 
 
 This feature is magnificent. The challenge it faces is the cartel currently running the Ugandan movie industry.
 
 
  
 
 
 One thing Yammzit has figured out is how to make money out of this without interfering the cartel. They are looking to charge users a booking fee. This cuts the back and forth of convincing movie companies to relinquish a percentage of their revenue. 
 
 
  
 
 
 But, even then, theres another problem Yammzit will have to navigate.
 
 
  
 
 
 In 2016, a movie booking and ticketing startup called CineApp launched. But, they struggled to convince Cinemax and 3D Cinema to release their catalogues. Without the catalogue and showing time, the service becomes useless to the users.
 
 
 Support Features
 
 
 It is exciting and everyones dream to offer an end to end service. Yammzit is ensuring both users and businesses never exit unless theyre done. Thats why theyve built YamPay and Yammzit Workspace.
 
 
  
 
 
 It is a no-brainer that businesses will need Yammzit Workspace and YamPay. But, at a later stage. With little or no resources at hand, the focus should be on building a single product that will make a user go wow. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Up until now, you cant book a ticket using Facebook. Thats not a mistake. At one point, Facebook will have to introduce it. What this means is that focus is very important.
 
 
  
 
 
 This goes to all the features Yammzit has launched today. They are spreading themselves wide and thin. It is no doubt all the challenges theyre trying to solve are real and need solutions. But, so far, there are none of these features I can use that will make me go wow.
 
 
 Observations
 
 
 This is among the first product feature launches in Uganda. It will set a new precedence. Where startups introduce new features and products to audiences and the media in an organized way.
 
 
  
 
 
 Another key and important observation was the presence of Stevens dad. Mr Twinomugisha and his wife. He said that so far, they have supported them with over UGx. 50,000,000. Now, this is a lot of money coming from a Ugandan parent. But, it is a tip of the required amount to prototype and brings a product to market.
 
 
  
 
 
 But, that small and initial amount helps startups survive when not making revenue. Family and friends should be the ones to bring in that initial amount. Though, that link has been missing.

"After announcing a $1.5M seed round this year, Uganda-based Asaak is raising again
","In December last year, Asaak  a Uganda-based mobile SME lender  announced that it had closed a $1.5 million Series Seed.
 U.S.-based venture capital firm, Resolute Ventures  led the round which closed in November last year. Other notable investors included 500 Startups, Catalyst Fund, HOF Capital, and Social Capital.
 Yet, less than a year since the announcement, the startup has opened up the second round of equity financing. That is according to Dylan Terril, Asaak’s Chief Business Officer.
 In conversation with him, we talked about their fundraising plans. Though he declined to reveal the actual amount and other details.
 “We started raising a few weeks ago [September,],” Dylan started, “[and] we should close by end of the year.”
 Although they have raised institutional debt before, they are only looking at equity capital for this particular round. “Weve secured some institutional debt recently, but right now we are focused on expanding the operations of the business and building product,” he said.
 Many lending businesses have struggled when it comes to repayment. But, Dylan says that they are heading into the fundraising at a point when repayment for loans is quite high.
 Something he believes is aided by the fact that each loan is backed by collateral. Though, they project that in the future, their loans will be advanced based on credit scoring.
 Founded in 2016 by Kaivan K. Sattar and Titus Opesen, Asaak has a full-time team of 26. This is distributed across San Francisco (USA), Kampala (Uganda) and Soroti (Uganda).
 Kaivan and Titus founded the startup during their work through a partnership with Pilgrim Africa and Engineers Without Borders in Soroti, Uganda. At that time, they were supplying farming villages with agriculture machinery. During the tenure, they found out that many small-scale farmers were struggling to access credit.
 Also read: CB Insights puts Q2 2018 investment in African fintechs at $63M
 “While there was an issue of not having the infrastructure for farming, the real issue they saw was that farmers didn’t have access to credit,” Dylan says.
 But, they also found out that the challenge wasn’t in Soroti alone. Hence the decision to spread out. “We realized that Soroti isnt the only place that needs a sustainable credit solution. There are other places and types of businesses that needed access to credit all over the country.”
 Asaak’s business model revolves around charging a premium on the loans that they advance. They receive funds from institutional investors, at an interest rate, then advance these to the borrowers at a marked up interest. The difference is what makes up their revenue.
 Although some mistake Asaak for a microfinance company, they say that they aren’t.
 As a lender in Africa, outside parties often mistake us for another microfinance solution. But we are a business lender backed by fintech,” Dylan says. Adding that we are trying to distance ourselves from the microfinance'.
 Currently, Asaak operates like a marketplace. This implies that investors can come in and advance loans to several businesses of their choosing. Although they are not looking to change that, the startup is also looking at raising its internal funds to finance those deals.
 “We have partners in the U.S. and Europe that are interested in this type of marketplace,” Dylan says, “so we’ve capitalized on those opportunities.” Adding that they “are also developing an internal fund.
 Having an internal fund makes sense. Not only can it allow Asaak to go into more riskier deals, but it also increases the margins they make per loan.
 Asaak started out lending to small-scale farmers. In fact, Dylan says that some of our clients have never taken a loan before. Yet, they have expanded lending to SMEs, that have the ability to absorb over $25,000. Dylan describes SMEs as those who have grown tired with the traditional banking sector.
 Currently, their loan average amount is around $4,000. And that it is partly because of the wide range of customers that they cater to now.
 “We work with large-scale businesses that need UGX. 100,000,000 (about $27,000) but also work with farmers that need UGX. 500,000 (about $135),” he says. In fact, the smallest amount that one can borrow is UGX. 300,000 (about $80).
 Also read: According to CB Insights, there are only 3 unicorns in Africa
 The lending space in emerging markets is becoming crowded. In fact, many are starting to believe that it is already saturated.
 In Uganda, Asaak’s competition ranges from fellow tech startups like Numida, already established microfinance institutions and banks to asset financing institutions like Tugende.
 But, Dylan points out the ability to secure a large loan using their mobile app as their competitive edge. That way, he believes that Asaak can reach as many people in the country. This level of scale, of course, is hard for traditional lenders like banks to easily replicate.
 “The idea behind Asaak was that we want to reach as many people as possible. We wanted to bring that to Uganda so that no matter where you are you can get a loan,” Dylan said.
 Despite the competition, Dylan believes that there’s room for them not only in Uganda but in the neighboring countries too. “Theres a lot of digital lenders in Kenya, but theres an unmet need for a fintech addressing the market for large, secured loans,” he said.
 “In the short term, I would say we are focused on Uganda. But in the long term, say 12 months we are looking at other markets. Like Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia and more. We will be a pan-African solution.”

"SolarNow Secures $6M in SunFunder led syndicated receivables financing facility
","On the 17th of October, SunFunder announced its first syndication which involved leading off-grid solar company SolarNow in Uganda. The deal had Oikocredit and responsAbility Investments as the the other investors.
 As Ryan Levinson, SunFunder CEO, put it:
 
 “Our customers need more scalable, less time-consuming financing options so they can focus on their core business delivering solar energy. By leading syndications, SunFunder offers solar companies larger ticket size loans with less hassle, and gives investors a route into the market.”
 
 The $6 million facility is SolarNow’s second structured asset finance instrument, known as SAFI, arranged by SunFunder.
 SAFI is a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle designed to finance off-grid residential solar companies’ customer receivables. This enables them to expand their pay-as-you-go or solar lease offerings to reach more people living without access to energy.
 SolarNow and SunFunder have now completed five transactions together, tracking the growth of the sector itself from humble origins to larger and increasingly sophisticated deployments.
 “We are thrilled to continue building our fruitful relationship with SunFunder,” Willem Nolens, SolarNow CEO, said.
 “So far, it has allowed us to focus entirely on our growth and profitability reaching more than 25,000 clients. This new step of our partnership will enable us to continue tackling the massive unmet market opportunity in East Africa of providing affordable energy to millions of off-grid households, and to reach 70% of Uganda’s off-grid population with solar home systems.”

 SunFunder acted as the Arranger, Lender and Facility Agent for the $6 million facility, with each lender providing $2 million to the facility. While it is SolarNow’s second SAFI transaction, it represents the first syndicated SAFI in the market.
 “We are delighted to build on our long-standing relationship with SolarNow and bring in additional investors,” Ryan Levinson added. SolarNow sells, finances and installs modular solar systems and solar appliances (TVs, fridges, water pumps, etc.) to rural households and entrepreneurs through a network of 55 branches and 750 staff in Uganda and Kenya.
 Maite Pina, Investment Officer at Oikocredit, said, “We see SolarNow as a company that prioritises its customers in order to meet their needs with the right solar products and services.”
 Speaking on behalf of responsAbility, Stefan Issler, Head Direct Investments, Energy Debt Financing, underlined that “Access to energy is a core topic when it comes to developing economies.”

"Africa’s first digital journalism training platform launches
","The news cycle is relentless. It doesn’t allow for journalists to take weeks off to learn new skills. That’s why Code for Africa, with support from Google News Lab and the World Bank’s Global Media Development Programme, has launched a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) specifically designed for African journalists. This will boost Africas digital journalism.
 The MOOC is free of charge and launches with 47 lessons created by some of the world’s leading digital journalism experts. Structured around six initial courses, the lessons start with basic numeracy and continue to advanced subjects such as mapmaking and video production.
 The lessons are designed to help to speed up newsgathering processes; improve journalists’ ability to check facts quickly; and provide the background necessary to produce charts, graphics and content for social sharing. Additional lessons offering new techniques or increasingly advanced skills will be added on a regular basis.
 The initiative is designed to address the challenges highlighted in the State of Technology in Global Newsrooms survey by the International Center for Journalists, which confirms that only half of new hires in newsrooms in sub-Saharan Africa have any experience with digital news tools.
 Lessons, therefore, include concise tipsheets and practical exercises using Africa-specific data or scenarios for journalists to immediately try out new skills. Participants can tailor courses to their most pressing needs, by mixing and matching modules.
 Journalists who need help fast, while on deadline, are able to learn the exact tool they need in minutes.
 The initiative is run as an academy, underpinned by CfA’s award-winning StoryLab journalism laboratory, and has already signed-up 3,700 students while running a series of pilot MOOC courses over the past four months.
 The academy also hosts monthly public workshops in 12 hub cities across the continent, in partnership with local Hacks/Hackers chapters, and offers additional seminars at 29 partner newsrooms. More than 2,850 journalists have been trained at the events.
 Matt Cooke, the Head of Partnerships &amp; Training at Google News Lab says, “Since announcing our partnership with Code for Africa last summer, almost 3,000 journalists in 12 major cities have received training on digital tools in person.
 Also read: Village Capital launches an arm targeting multinational corporations
 With the launch of this online course, we hope to empower journalists right across Africa to learn at their own pace, dive deeper and discover a range of tools that can help them produce cutting-edge and compelling stories.”
 The academy has achieved some notable milestones. Mwananchi in Tanzania established the country’s first data journalism desk after journalists there underwent training by the academy.
 In Nigeria, a Punch team trained by the academy produced the Shifting Sands exposé on illegal sand dredging that combined the power of data journalism with the visual impact of drone footage and satellite images to produce the publication’s most successful digital story.
 When the academy launched, it aimed to forge five university partners: it currently has 12 across Africa, with more to come. Three of these universities have incorporated the academy’s curriculum into their journalism courses.

"Zambia&#8217;s Z&#8217;POS is offering SMEs an alternative to POS machines
","According to the World Economic Forum, small and growing businesses in Africa create around 80% of the region’s employment. They are also responsible for establishing a new middle class and fueling demand for new goods and services. Despite their significance, they are still plagued with challenges.
 But, recently, the number of startups tapping into these SMEs has risen. These provide services ranging from tools for tracking sales and stock to credit. Zambia’s Z’POS  a product of Outsource Now  is joining that club.
 Founded in early 2017, Z’POS has the aim of enabling businesses in Zambia to manage their sales. The startup’s focus is small and medium-sized retail shops in all retail sectors. Think FMCGs, auto-spare shops, boutiques and the like.
 A graduate of the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program, ZPOS is the “the first company in Zambia that is working to organize Zambias informal retail data.”
 “Before ZPOS, most micro merchants either wrote in sales books or never recorded them at all,” Chisepo Chirwa, co-founder and CEO, says. “A few others used cash registers or those that could afford bought point of sale (POS) software that they had installed for them on PCs.”
 Apart from POS software re-sellers and cash register suppliers, Chisepo struggles to identify other local competitors. But this changes when you change to the continental scope.
 The most notable one of them is YOCO from South Africa  which closed a $16 million Series A in a round led by Partech Ventures. Another one is Uganda-based Swipe2pay that closed $40,000 from Rwanda-based Leapfrog Ventures.

 Z’POS, too, has raised at least $57,500 in funding in both equity and grants. The startup scored $7,500 in grant funding from the Tony Elumelu Foundation ($5k) and Insight to Impact ($2.5k). It also attracted an extra $50,000 in equity investment in June this year from Zenga Ventures and Ground Squirrel Ventures.
 Chisepo says that this has propelled them to a couple of merchants. “We have tested the ZPOS concept for over a year with over 70 merchants now signed up,” he said.
 Currently, they are carrying out a beta test of their Android app with a limited number of 5 merchants. Though, they are getting ready for a roll-out to 200 merchants (first) and then 5000.
 “We will roll-out to 200 merchants by April 2019 and then use foot-soldiers to reach 5k merchants by end of 2019,” Chisepo noted, “we expect to expand onwards thereafter.”
 The startup currently charges an undisclosed annual license fee for users on the ZPOS platform. Though, at the same time, they are planning to explore a freemium model where users will pay for using the advanced version of ZPOS. We expect to charge merchants an average of $9 per month to use ZPOS, he said.
 Additionally, Chisepo says that they are looking to explore partnerships with Financial Services Providers. The two will then split the difference. “We will also partner with FSPs that will offer loans on the platform to deserving merchants. We expect to share revenue with the FSPs.”
 The startups team consists of 6 with the founders  Vernon Ushibantu (CFO) and Mukopaje Singogo (CTO).

"Village Capital launches an arm targeting multinational corporations
","Village capital has launched Village Capital Innovations, an arm aimed at multinational corporations. Communication from Allie Burns, MD Village Capital, says that Village Capital Innovations will help partners work with entrepreneurs to find solutions to real-world problems.
 Partners will use it to navigate new geographies and industries outside the mandate of Village Capitals Investments fund.
 Founded in 2010, Village Capital “builds bridges for entrepreneurs who are creating an inclusive and sustainable world.” It operates as an accelerator, entrepreneurship program and venture capital fund.
 Also read: Kenya’s M-KOPA raises additional $10 Million in funding
 The companys investments fund invests in early-stage ventures in emerging markets. Giving them amounts ranging from $10,000 to $4 Million, so far. In May 2016, it raised US$17.7 million in funding for its investments Fund, VilCap Investments. Backed by 29 investors.
 Yet, this is not enough to create the impact the company desires. Hence the launch of Village Capital Innovations to help corporations and align their business and social interests.
 Because, going by the words of the chair and CEO of multi-trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock, Larry Fink, the future of investment is impact-based. And success will be tied to social impact success of the business. is re-writing the rules.
 Village capital Innovations plans to work with corporations, governments and other organizations. Providing them with “advice, research and hands-on guidance”.
 The rise of impact investment implies corporations must align business and social impact. VilCap has so far worked with the likes of Microsoft, Unilever, PayPal, UBS, and Citi, Autodesk and others. The growing list of companies Village Capital is working with demonstrates an increasing need for the service.
 Burns says that “for the past fifty years or so, most companies have separated their core financial objectives (their business pocket) from their philanthropic and charitable work (their social good pocket).” This was “driven by the belief that focusing on the latter would hinder financial performance.”
 Adding that “VilCap Innovations will help us grow our impact and more broadly accelerate the shift [of multinational corporations] to one-pocket thinking.”
 The Impact Investing Benchmark from Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) shows that “venture funds that intentionally integrate social impact with financial returns in emerging markets outperform [their peers].”
 Also read: We raised funding from Greentec &amp; Village Capital, Henri Nyakarundi
 Nonetheless, as Village Capital Co-founder and CEO, Ross Baird wrote, “CEOs [still] think about quarterly returns ahead of thinking about what they can do for their community.” Making it hard to put both their business and social metrics in “one pocket”.
 Which means, “the hunt for new customers and new innovations” is what is going to draw multinational corporations “toward entrepreneurs who are driving impact on the ground.” Writes Impact Alphas Dennis Price.
 Allie Burns wrote; “In January, Larry Fink, the chair and CEO of multi-trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock, issued an ultimatum to corporate executives: if they want to receive investment from BlackRock, their businesses must have a social purpose.”
 To date, BlackRock has funded two Village Capital programs around financial inclusion and financial technology in India and Mexico. Besides providing extensive mentor support to participating entrepreneurs.
 Thus no doubt Village Capitals decision could have had the backing of Blackrock. Perhaps to ensure they help the companies achieve their social impact performance metrics. Plus, no doubt the number of multinationals thatll seek an expert in the field of social impact will skyrocket.
 “If BlackRock does what it says it’s going to do, ” Ross Baird writes, “It will mean that a company’s impact — positive or negative — becomes a painkiller (NEED), not a vitamin (WANT).” At that point, all the multinationals will turn to Village Capital.
 Microsoft, for example, turned to Village Capital when it wanted to support local entrepreneurs working to connect to the internet the world’s remaining unconnected communities.
 Dennis Price says that “long before BlackRock’s letter to corporate CEOs calling for them to define their purpose, corporations were palling around with impact firms and investors looking for the “impact alpha.”
 “Global consumer good company Unilever has partnered with solar energy firm d.light since 2014, purchasing solar lanterns to place in small shops that sell Unilever products, allowing the shops to remain into the evening. Acumen, the global impact investor, has helped connect firms like Dow, Unilever, SAP and GE to its portfolio companies, helping the multinationals build more inclusive and sustainable supply chains.”

"Startup Digest Africa, TASLAF Partner to Offer Ugandan Startups Free Legal Advice
","Yesterday, Startup Digest Africa Founder, Peter Kisadha Malinz, and Stephen Tumwesigye, a partner at Taslaf Advocates and Consultants, met to discuss and later agree to a partnership to offer free legal advice to Ugandan startups courtesy of the firms probono program.
 Both parties are excited about the partnership because it comes at a time when few startup founders in Uganda know who the right legal person or firm to approach. It is also a time when technology entrepreneurs are on the rise yet few lawyers or firms have the knowledge and experience to address the challenges this rise is presenting.
 Worth noting is also the fact that while as some startups may know who to approach, they can not afford to foot such expenses. Thats why we hope that this partnership can help solve such challenges.
 With experience offering legal services to startup ecosystem players like Acumen and Village Energy, TASLAF is no-doubt the right partner. For Startup Digest Africa, this is one of the first steps it is taking in ensuring the Ugandan startup ecosystem is connected to support startup founders to easily build self-sustaining companies.
 The two parties are looking at relaying the advice through three formats. The first will be through a monthly article written by the firm addressing any startup legal issues or clarify on any legal knowledge gaps in the Ugandan startup ecosystem.
 The first will be through a monthly article written by the firm addressing any startup legal issues or clarify on any legal knowledge gaps in the Ugandan startup ecosystem.
 The second will be through a monthly Startup Clinic which will see startups get face-to-face answers to their unanswered questions by partners or associates from the firm. The clinic will also feature other contributors like Banks, Accountancy firms, HR firms, Marketing and PR firms etc. The aim is to see that Ugandan startups can access services that are crucial to their survival  which they can not afford  for free at least once a month.
 The third and last is through organizing occasional legal hackathons aimed at helping them understand their legal obligations.

"Uganda&#8217;s inCcelerate announces 7 finalists for its fellowship
","Last year, we reported that Ugandan startup accelerator program, inCcelerate, was looking for applicants to its ‘Startup for Startups’ Program aimed at building a startup culture among Ugandan entrepreneurs.
 Today, the startup accelerator by enStartup has announced that it shortlisted 7 successful candidates out of a pool of 64 applicants. These were selected on the basis of willingness to learn and commitment to building new businesses with other individuals.
 We were looking out for individuals who were willing to learn, and that was really committed to building new businesses with other individuals. Most considered coming to the fellowship with their already existing solutions which was fairly wrong with our kind of model as inCcelerate, said Moris Atwine, from enStartup.

 He also added that inCcelerate is on a path to building early-stage companies, where we take into account that working in a new business is often like living on the edge. With this, everyone who goes through the entire application process has to be in it together.
 This is the first-ever inCcelerate Cohort which will be a full-time 3-month fellowship opportunity that will enable finalists to become enMembers, according to the official press release from enStartup.
 The shortlisted individuals will now get to work with other smart and talented enMembers as well as get to refine their skills as inCcelerate creates a culture where prototyping, modelling, tinkering are the norm and fail fast is acceptable, part of the statement added
 The finalists are; Joshua Wegoye, Mubadi Mercy, Joshua Mulwana, Munyambabazi Daniel, Edna Yvonne, Hassan Kanja and Ecweru Rodney.
 When asked about the mode of investment and what they expect to get in return, Moris clarified that enStartup will be investing a minimum of $10,000 into the startups formed during the fellowship. For this, theyll take a 10% equity depending on the service/product each of the teams will come up with, he added.
 
 We are investing our own money as enStartup! enStartup Inc is a Technology Company registered globally, that’s building a startup culture among creatives in Uganda. This is Personal Money!
 
 He also added that they are investing in individuals who are starting ventures on a pathway to solving relevant problems, and planning for scale, where we shall use a modification of our ‘model’ in our design as inCcelerate prioritizes investing in people and the relentless pursuit of a startup venture growth.
 The first cohort kicks off on the 15th of January until April 14th, 2018.

"Startup Battlefield Africa winner, Lori Systems, set to launch in Uganda
","Lori Systems, the winner of last years Startup Battlefield Africa in Kenya, is set to launch in Uganda. Going by this medium post from Bill McNeely, the Kenyan tech-driven truck coordination startup that launched in May 2017 is about to launch its operations in Uganda.
 In the post, Bill says that he started at Lori this week [of January 18th, 2018]. But currently in Mambosa, Kenya getting up to speed on standard operating procedures.
 Although Josh Sandler pointed out that Lori was operating in Kenya and Uganda at his Startup Battlefield Pitch, that doesnt seem to be the case. Because, in the same post, Bill added that he is starting off as an Operations Manager and will be helping to launch Lori in Uganda in the coming months.
 On his LinkedIn profile, and through the conversation we had [today on 25/01/2018] with him at the Innovation Village in Kampala, Bill indicated that he started working as the Operations Manager in January 2018.
 Lori, upon launching in Uganda, is likely to set up shop at The Innovation Bureau  which is the wing of The Innovation Village that accommodates regional and local companies. Some of the companies there include Andela, Vouch Digital, Xente, Kola Studios, Sellio etc. (See also: The Innovation Bureau: Is it the “Silicon Valley” Ugandan Entrepreneurs have been Waiting for?)
 When it comes to setting up, it seems the company is likely to do so earlier than what Bills article says. Considering that the companys CEO and Founder, South African born Josh Sandler, is in Uganda too.
 Lori systems provides a payments and tracking platform for logistics companies. With a web- and mobile-based system, the startup offers freight management that coordinates truckers and shippers to reduce inefficiencies and margin capture.
 To break it down, as it is currently if one is to move goods from Mombasa or Juba to Kampala, that truck or container comes loaded and goes back empty. In certain cases, it also comes not loaded to full capacity. So, what Lori is doing is to bridge that inefficiency gap.
 Currently, theres no company offering a centralized platform in Uganda to close the gap. Which makes perfect sense for Lori to launch. However, in Lagos, Ligare with a slightly similar product launched last year.
 In Uganda, if Lori is able to bring Multiple, Aponye, Seroma and other logistics and courier companies on board, then it can eventually lead to reduced costs of running a logistics business. Because having loaded trucks for both to and fro trips ensures a split cost. This, in turn, can probably result in increased volumes.

"Strive Masiyiwa&#8217;s Econet gets into ride-hailing with Vaya Lift
","Econet  through a subsidiary Cassava  launched a ride-hailing service in Harare, Zimbabwe. Called Vaya Lift, the service has been under testing phase for at least the past one and a half months.
 Vaya Lifts app is already available on both Android and iOS. Eddie Chibi, the Cassava Smarttech Zimbabwe CEO, said that they already have drivers on the app.
 As we speak, we already have over 500 active drivers and the number is growing on a daily basis, but we have stepped up our recruitment drive,” he said.
 As part of a promotion to lure more drivers, they are now offering 10 liters of free fuel and US $5 worth of airtime. Eugene Gorimani, from Cassava, added that they are also offering free comprehensive EcoSure mobile cover.
 On top of that, new riders will also receive at least US $5 for each day youre working on your Vaya. They also coupled this with the promise that the riders can actually make up to $1,000 a month. A claim some existing drivers on the app backed in their testimonials.
 For the new individual riders, the company is offering 5 free rides. While the number goes to 100 free rides for new corporate clients. Of course, they will make payments through EcoCash.
 Vaya Lift carries the latest security features that Uber unveiled recently across EMEA. These include the option of using a panic button when in danger as well as adding a number for the next of kin.

 In a market where Uber and Taxify  Africas leading ride-hailing companies  have shunned, there remains an opportunity for a leader to emerge.
 Being the leading telecom in the country, Econet is looking to leverage its position. In the process, they are creating an ecosystem of interdependent products. The same things MTN, Safaricom and all other leading telecoms have done.
 Safaricom launched a ride-hailing company, Little, and an e-commerce marketplace, Masoko. They followed this with a music streaming service, Songa and a platform for farmers to access finances, M-Farm.
 While MTN recently partnered with Tidal to launch its service in Uganda. As well as with Mastercard to allow its mobile money users to make online payments.
 Cassava smart-tech Zimbabwe is a subsidiary of Cassava Smarttech international. Which in turn is a subsidiary of the Econet Wireless Group, which was founded by Strive Masiyiwa. EcoCash, EcoSure, and EcoFarmer are all roofed under Cassava Smarttech.
 Within Cassava Smarttech, Econet has also created another subsidiary called Cassava On-demand Services. Vaya Lift is the first of the many services that the company is looking to launch.
 We are launching a piece of a lot of other things which [we] are going to see in the next couple of weeks if not days, Chibi said. While Eugene added that their aim is an app that can allow one to access anything on demand.
 Maybe tomorrow you might be looking at getting a gardener on demand, Eugen said. Adding that; Maybe I can even get to request a make-over for my wife from the comfort of our home.
 According to reports from both TechZim and The Standard Zimbabwe, either Cassava Smarttech Zimbabwe or Cassava On-Demand Services will be listed on its own on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.

"Is this Why BrighterMonday Closed the Ugandan Office?
","BrighterMonday, an online recruitment platform recently closed their Ugandan offices, together with its sister venture, an online car selling platform cheki.com. They were housed at The Space Hub on Bukoto Street in Kamwokya.
 Although the website dedicated to the Ugandan market remains up and running, BrighterMonday has no single staff in Uganda. It is currently run by its team in Kenya.
 When we contacted one of the individuals that were in close proximity with the venture, he was able to walk us from the point BrighterMondays troubled times began  which is mid-2016.
 There were rumors of downsizing at the venture mid-2016 which were confirmed towards the end of the year when the venture reduced its staff from double to single digits. This probably was pressure from investors to break even.
 At the same time, BrighterMonday was contracted to run the ReadyToWork campaign by Barclays bank. But, this was short lived and later terminated early 2017 when Barclays bank decided they would run the program in-house.
 This could have potentially escalated the troubles at the already troubled venture that was already struggling to keep hold of its clients as well as how to monetize its products which led to further downsizing.
 Currently, the venture is only surviving by scraping jobs from other companies websites as well as job sites. However, one only wonders how far this will take the venture. It is also not clear whether they have plans to bounce back in the Ugandan market.
 When we asked our source, who is familiar with both the recruitment space in Kenya and Uganda, why BrighterMonday struggled here, he hinted on the fact that the Kenyan market is ahead of the Ugandan one.
 Yet, BrighterMonday failed to understand the difference and applied the same tactics that had made it successful in Kenya.
 BrighterMonday is owned by One Africa Media group with interest in jobs, cars, property and travel space. Other ventures owned by the group include Cheki, Jobberman, PrivateProperty, BuyrentKenya, SafariNow and StayNow. Yet the group currently has no offices in Uganda.
 With BrighterMondays exit from the Ugandan market, it means Uganda Jobline, Jumia Jobs, Pro-Interns and New Vision Jobs as the main Job sites in the country.

","Yesterday [09/10/2018] electric mobility company EkoRent Africa launched Nopia Ride, a full electric mobility service in Nairobi, Kenya. “We have now launched our zero-emission electric transportation service pilot in Nairobi,” reads a statement on their website.
 Joining a highly competitive industry, Nopia is employing the same book-ride-and-pay formula. Users will download the Nopia Ride mobile app to locate and book vehicles.

 The firm rates their vehicles as 100% electric and good for our planet. Adding that, they are 30-50% cheaper to operate [for drivers] than traditional polluting gasoline cars.
 This implies that even the cost of riding should be cheaper for those that will opt to use the service. The ride-hailing company says that it allows its users to make payments using M-Pesa Xpress functionality. This allows the riders to clear their trip bills digitally instead of using cash.
 Read About: Jibu is now in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 The Kenyan ride-hailing market already has existing players in the names of Uber, Taxify, Mondo Ride and Little Cab.
 Nopia will have to fend these off in order to thrive in the market. Though the company says that its service should be the best alternative for those seeking cab services because they aim to reach zero pollution levels.
 “We care about the environment. Therefore, all our Nopia vehicles are non-polluting electric cars. By choosing Nopia, you help to reduce harmful emissions and to improve the air quality around you,” the company further adds.
 Nopia Charging Bays will be available around Nairobi for easy recharging of the vehicles. This is the first fully electric ride-hailing service in East Africa and is an inspiration for African development.
 Nopia is a product of Finnish company EkoRent. Headquartered in Helsinkin, Finland, and founded in 2014, EkoRent has raised at least €458,400 in funding according to their CrunchBase profile. €170,900 of that was raised in 2016 through an equity from an equity crowdfunding round.

"Two of Africa&#8217;s leading boda-hailing startups are backed by same investor
","Currently, at least 40% of Africas population lives in urban areas. But, this figure is projected to rise to 58 per cent over the next three and a half decades. That is according to the UN‐Habitat.
 Yet, with the rise in the number of urban dwellers comes other challenges  one of them being the traffic jam. The problem has become so severe that major African cities are losing a huge chunk of their GDP due to it.
 The World Bank, in a 2012 report, indicated that Cairo loses an estimated $8 billion annually to traffic congestion.
 Another recent study by the bank pointed out that traffic jams are costing Uganda over US$800m in lost Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While, according to the Kenyan government, the time wasted in Nairobi traffic jams represents a cost of $578,000 a day in lost productivity.
 Also read: US-based Precursor Ventures enters Africa with two startup investments
 This holds true for all other African major cities. Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, is home to some of the worse traffic congestions experienced in West Africa.
 Against this backdrop, entrepreneurs are proposing solutions that can tackle the problem. Among these is the use of bikes, boda-bodas or Okadas  depending on which region of the continent youre from. So far, the two-wheelers have proved a magical silver bullet to solve the traffic problem.
 And, investors have also taken notice. One of such investors is Johannesburg-based CRE Ventures. The VC firm has responded by backing both Lagos-based Gokada and Kampala-based SafeBoda.
 Founded last year by Deji Oduntan, Gokada launched with the aim of solving the transportation and logistics challenges facing millions of Nigerians in metropolitan Lagos.
 
 The startup uses 200 cc motorbikes that are allowed to move on major roads in Lagos. Unlike the conventional 100 cc motorbikes driven by the regular ‘Okada’ drivers that are banned from moving on major roads in Lagos State
 
 Early this year, Gokada raised $337,333 in funding, per their SEC filing. Though there are no details about the investors, New York-based Adventure Capital participated in the round. It is easy to connect the dots here given that Gokada is among the VC firms portfolio companies. Additionally, Fahim Saleh  Adventure Capitals co-founder  is the person whose names appear on the SEC form D.
 For CRE Ventures, there are no details to show that they participated in the round. Other than the fact that they state the startup among their portfolio.
 The VC fund also lists SafeBoda amongst its investees on its portfolio page. Though there hasnt been a public statement from either of the company, it is likely that CRE Ventures participated in a funding round that SafeBoda raised early this year.
 According to a trusted source, SafeBoda closed a $1.1 million round at the beginning of 2018. We suspect that is the round that CRE Ventures participated in.
 Also read: Uber and Jumo partner to create a car asset financing product
 By making an investment in both SafeBoda and Gokada, the firm could be positioning itself for a kingmaker position in the industry. With time, they could decide to merge their investments for a potential exit to some of the big players in the market like Uber or Taxify.
 Or, it could be a moat they can build to ensure their portfolio companies run away with the market. Something SoftBank did with USs Uber, Chinas Didi Chuxing and Southeast Asias Grab.
 Since SoftBank has its hand in each of the above, they strategically pull cards to ensure they dont compete. Rather, become leaders in their respective markets by leveraging the shared connection. For example, Uber sold its Chinese business to Didi and its Southeast Asia business to Grab. CRE Ventures could decide to do the same.
 Over the past few years, CRE Ventures has turned itself into one of the leading VC funds across Africa. Founded in 2014, the fund has participated in at least 29 funding rounds. But, their highlight came last year when they led Andelas $40 million Series C.
 Though, they had also before participated in the startups $24 million Series B which led by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
 Among CRE Ventures other notable investees include Asoko Insights, Flutterwave, Rensource Energy, Lynk, Yoco and Sweepsouth.

"Village Capital has released a book to guide first-time founders on raising talent
","Village Capital, an organization that is reinventing the system to back the entrepreneurs
 of the future, has released a book [PDF] to guide first-time founders on raising talent. The 37 paged eBook with 9 chapters breaks down the process of hiring and retention, especially for first-time startup founders.
 Raising talent is just as important as raising capital, reads the tagline for the book with the objective of emphasizing how important hiring is for a startup.
 Allie Burns, the Managing Director of Village Capital remarked that although startups say they need funding to hire talent, it takes talent to raise funding.
 Theres a catch-22 with which any emerging market startup founder is familiar: it’s hard to raise money without the right team, but it’s hard to afford the right team before you raise money, Allie Burns said.
 The book outlines the mistakes that startup founders usually make when hiring or trying to retain talent. One of them, according to the book, is treating hiring as any other administrative task rather than a strategic one.
 Also read: Here’s how GSMA startups are using mobile technology to deliver their services
 Early-stage entrepreneurs make the mistake of viewing building their team as an
 administrative function, as simply hiring, the book notes. Adding that successful later stage business leaders understand that human capital is a strategic function.
 They, therefore, recommend that instead of hiring talent that meets their current needs, founders should focus on hiring talent that can take them to their next destination. Hire for the stage you want to reach, not the stage you’re at, the book pointed out.
 The book also emphasized the essence of an organization chart and storytelling for early-stage startups. It also provides additional insights and guidance to founders on how to compete for top talent, hire for an all-star team and set up their teams for success.
 Beyond that, it introduces the founders to performance management and employee engagement as well as how to translate themselves from the entrepreneur hustle to a manager and leader.
 Towards the end, the book also provided a case study of Deloitte which used similar principles to radically re-define their performance management system. The case study focused on how a Global organization with over 240,000 employees applied or implemented the guidelines and tips successfully.
 The book was compiled with the support of Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs and Argidius Foundation. While different partners contributed knowledge and the content for the various chapters depending on their field of expertize.
 The content partners are; Open Capital Advisors, African Management Initiative, Ripple Works, Resonate, Shortlist, and Edge.

"This Ugandan Youth is Slowly Building A Film Company With Friends
","I first met Nelson in 2015. At that time, he was making music videos for a few unknown Ugandan artists. But, one of his videos stood out for me. It was called Enanga.
 Right now, two years down the road, his videos are playing on both local and regional TV stations. The notable one being Trace Mziki. But, Nelson is not about to stop. His end goal is his company, Egotastic Media being among the household names on the continent.
 Nelson Dramuke is the co-founder of Egotastic media  a media, and filming company. Asked how business has been, Nelson told me that actually, they have been making strides. Right now Id say business is at a much better level than what we were doing, Nelson informed me.
 Nelson and the team onset
 This is partly because they recently acquired new equipment. This included cameras and drones. They also have a couple of projects coming there way this month (July) which Nelson said: are going to be helpful for the development of the company.
 Looks upto
 When asked who he admires in the industry currently, he pointed out the simplicity Clarence A. Peters brings to the industry as well as Hanscana (directed Muziki for Darassa and Eddy Kenzos Shauri Yako) who has been able to dominate the industry in Tanzania.
 He was also quick to acknowledge the works of Enos as well as Ogopa Deejays.
 Seeing that Nelson recently visited Nairobi, Zanzibar and Dar el Salaam, I asked him why he did not take the time to reach out to these directors for mentorship.
 His answer, just like most people starting out was, I dont know exactly how to get close to these guys but one thing I have realized when it comes to us here in Uganda. Most of the guys in this same industry like us especially dont want anyone to get close to him
 This is partly correct, not only in Nelsons industry but almost everywhere. However, it is also true that there are those who are willing to help out. So, the trick is simple, reach out to ten. Probably five will reply and maybe two will be willing to help out. But dont just give up.
 Some of the new Equipment
 Though Nelson cited help from Jim Resley. Jim is the one who directed the Batuwulura Video, a song by Big Trill and Fille  both Ugandan artists. He also directed Pretty Girls by Big Trill. Unfortunately, Jim is not in Uganda anymore as he was signed by some film company in Canada and stayed there.
 Challenges
 Nelson cites that Kenyan and other film directors have it easy when they come to Uganda. Yet, when Ugandan directors go to those countries, it is not easy. This he blames on the regulatory authority in Uganda.
 
 When a Ugandan director goes to Kenya, it is hard. Because Kenya has a filming body which has strict rules  Nelson
 
 The team
 When asked whether he thinks his team is the right one for the job, Nelson says the fact it is comprising of guys who are friends and know what they want is enough.
 To him besides the bit of making money, it is a group of boys that have the vision and the focus. Aside from making videos, he believes theyre also very passionate about building something thats going to last for a long time.
 However, working with friends and family has both advantages and disadvantages. One of the key advantages is that at the start theyre more than willing to work for no or little pay.
 The downside is that as you grow and need to pull a plug on them, it gets harder and harder.
 Vision
 On what his vision is, Nelson says that right now, Id say that we are just a film company but were building it to be a media company. Media covers a lot of things. Some two years ago, we didnt understand what a media company was exactly. But now, we have got the experience in the industry. We know media is not all about doing music videos and we got someone to come on the investment side of it.
 
 Now, we have got the experience in the industry. We know media is not all about doing music videos. Also, we got someone to come on on the investment side of it because he understands what media is, so he wants to build it into a company thats bigger than just music videos  Nelson
 
 Competitive Edge
 On why he believes this is the right time Egotastic Media to exist, Nelson thinks because we have the ability to deal with clients that are giving you little pay and yet give them a video thats twice the value of their pay makes which makes us stand out.
 This is very vital especially in an industry where artists dont have recording and filming deals from companies but instead have to do it as individuals.
 Yet, the downside is that it may not be sustainable in the long-run especially if the margins are small or non-existent.
 Some of the equipment recently got from their investor
 Nelson also believes that it is time more creativity is added to the local videos. He says most of the videos we have still lack the art. People are tired of having monotony in videos. Instead, theyd want to watch something simple but captivating.
 Now
 In a month, Egotastic Media gets a minimum of 4 projects. But for this month (July) they are anticipating close to 11 videos they are supposed to do. Although this means reducing on time allocated per project, Nelson says they are to do as much as possible and give their clients time.
 Of the upcoming projects, one of them is with Ugandan music group Voltage Music another with Nutty Nathan, another local Ugandan dancehall artist.

"mPharma launches initiative to save collapsing pharmacies
","
 
 MPharma, whose mission is to make prescription drugs accessible and affordable, has launched a new offering. Dubbed QualityRx, the initiative is saving pharmacies that are about to collapse.
 According to the company, QualityRx is a pharmacy retailers cooperative that unites community pharmacies under one brand. Through the initiative, struggling pharmacy owners no longer need to face the difficult choice of closing down their pharmacies or selling to a pharmacy chain.
 This is because by joining QualityRx one can gain access to high-quality medicines, low prices, and an amazing customer experience.
 
 It was set up based on data from the work we do managing pharmacy inventory for hospitals and pharmacies, Gregory Rockson, co-founder and CEO of mPharma.
 
 Gregory says that QualityRx is focused on re-innovating established mom and pop pharmacies that are at the verge of collapsing.
 Once accepted under the initiative a couple of benefits await a pharmacy. One of them is the one access to up to US $10,000 in loans. Pharmacies can use the loan for either refurbishment or as working capital. The pharmacies also gain access to mPharmas inventory and finance management solutions.
 According to the company, pharmacies that have signed up under the QualityRx are more than doubling the revenues they had before joining the network.

 As part of the campaign to attract pharmacies to sign up, the company is running testimonials of beneficiaries. Among them is Mr. Amankwah [Video], who founded Fresh Spring Chemists in Tema, Ghana in 1996. He says that mPharma restocked his pharmacy at no cost.
 Yet, when asked about the details and terms of such arrangements, Gregory declined to reveal them. Saying that it is confidential.
 Founded in 2013, by Gregory Rockson, Daniel Shoukimas, and James Finucane, mPharma has operations in Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The company also has over 208 pharmacies under their portfolio.
 To-date they have raised over $11.6 million in total funding. The company received an initial $5m from Social Capital in 2015. Ashley Carroll and Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital both joined the board in 2015. Last year, they received a further $6m from the son of Indian industrialist Sunil Mittal, Shravin, who met Gregory at a World Economic Forum event in 2012.

"Startup Profile: Makanika Dot Com &#8211; The Ugandan &#8220;Uber&#8221; for Car Maintenance
","What is Makanika Dot Com?
 Makanika Dot Com is a Ugandan tech start-up. It is aiming at building a nation-wide network of garages to help Ugandan motorists get on-demand access to garages or mechanics and other service providers like spare part dealers, service stations, gas stations, vehicle towing/breakdown services, car accessories etc
 Solution
 In the recent years, Uganda has experienced a rapid growth in the automobile market, with automobile population more than doubling in the last decade.
 This boom, of course, comes with an increasing demand for automobile services including repairs, services, car enhancements like sound and security. It is arguably true that the number of service providers has also tremendously grown.
 However, finding a reliable one maybe hard as people keep complaining about dealing with crooks. Also, in case of emergency like a car breaking down on a long road trip or in the middle of the night, with no access to one’s regular provider e.g. mechanic, they may have no starting point. It is such challenges that they intend to solve.
 Funding and Incubation
 Makanika Dot Com is currently incubated at Hive Colab, a Kampala based a collaborative work space and innovation hub. From here, they are receiving mentor-ship and access to engineers.
 So far, the only mode of funding is through Bootstrapping by the co-founders though the team is open to any form of external funding as they believe this will help them scale their operations.
 Successes
 The startup doesnt have much successes to its belt though they believe being able to grow their network of mechanics from zero to 200 in just under 2 years is a great achievement. However, we were unable to prove if this number is true.
 They also claim to have a good number of clients (which they declined to reveal) that they are currently working with.
 Challenges
 When asked about any challenges they have faced so far, the team says they havent encountered any major challenges yet in their operations. Although they single out funding as as the main stumbling block to their efforts to scale as fast as possible.
 Team Members
 
 Michael R. Katagaya  Co-founder
 Meregurwa Moses  Co-founder
 
 My Thoughts
 Makanika Dot Com is not a revolutionary idea. It is just another clone of the fast rising Uber-concept. I am not saying that the idea is bad, but they dont have much leverage.
 All they need to do is execute flawlessly  yet my engagement with them led me to believe they are doing exactly the opposite. Theyre not yet good with their numbers  which should be the heart of any startup.
 I dont think funding is their biggest challenge at all  what to use that funding for is. You can not run a pilot in Mbale when you havent got a hold of Kampala.
 They also need to have a centralized platform for people to submit their orders. Currently they use Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter and phone calls. This is total confusion. These are supposed to be support avenues  not main.
 In conclusion, if the team needs external funding, they have  to more than double their efforts in terms of getting their figures right.

"A look at some of the 2018 African startup acquisitions, so far
","Compared to the mature startup ecosystems, there are still few African startup acquisitions taking place. Both in count and count value.
 It is not just the acquisitions, but exits in general. For example, the much anticipated Interswitch IPO is yet to happen. Though there’s hope it might happen, soon. Rocket Internet, Jumia’s investor, is also hinting at the possibility of an IPO for Jumia Group.
 Yet, on a small scale, there are exits happening in form of acquisition. For example, last year, PropertyPro (called Tolet.com.ng before) acquired Jumia House Nigeria. This year, there’s been slightly more activity. Which, anecdotally, signifies an upward trend.
 Here’s a list of some of the acquisitions that have so far happened in 2018. Important to note is that this list is not any way exhaustive.
 1. Zinox &amp; Konga
 Zinox acquired Nigerian e-commerce company, Konga in February. For long, Konga has been viewed as Jumia Nigerias main competitor.
 The total acquisition price remains undisclosed to-date. But Zinox spokesman Gideon Ayogu says the cash-for-equity deal was “way higher” than the $10 million price that has been widely reported.
 After the acquisition, Konga has merged with Yudala. Another e-commerce company associated with Zinox Technologies. The two companies will now trade under the Konga brand name. Fusing both online and offline aspects.
 2. Cape Networks Acquired &amp; Hewlett Packard Enterprises
 In March 2018, Aruba -a Hewlett Packard Enterprises Company, HPE, announced the acquisition of Cape Networks, a Cape Town-based Software as a Service, SaaS, and a hardware company. Following the acquisition, it became part of Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company.
 3. 1001 Squared &amp; QuickHelp
 Nigerian AI-enabled chatbot and SMS-based directory service QuickHelp was acquired by Canadian social enterprise firm 1001 Squared Artificial Intelligence for an undisclosed amount. QuickHelp is a free community-based business locator built with AI/Machine learning technologies. (See also: The future is looking brighter for African chatbots solutions)
 4. Samsung &amp; Kngine
 In March 2018, Egyptian-based Kngine, launched in 2013, was acquired by South Korea-based Samsung Electronics. The acquisitions, according to Egyptian Independent, was to “improve its virtual assistant Bixby.”
 Kngine, co-founded by brothers, Haytham and Ashraf ElFadeel, uses AI to develop an understanding of content by continuously reading the Web.
 Samsung first invested in Kngine through their venture capital unit, Samsung Next, jointly with Vodafone Ventures in 2014. Before executing a full acquisition of the company.
 5. BitPesa &amp; TransferZero
 BitPesa announced the acquisition of TransferZero in February 2018. TransferZero is “an international online money transfer platform that specializes in sending money to consumers and companies in 200 countries.”

 6. Kudobuzz, AdGeek &amp; RetailTower
 Kudobuzz, though on a relatively smaller scale, has been active in the field of acquisition since the beginning of the year. At the beginning of January, the Ghanaian startup, and one of the MEST Africa portfolio companies acquired AdGeek, an ad creation tool. The AdGeek team joined Kudobuz “as part of the terms of the acquisition”.

"How different African governments have reacted to cryptocurrency
","Zimbabwe, through its central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, recently banned cryptocurrency trading. The bank issued a warning to all the financial institutions in Zimbabwe. Giving them only 60 days  to end their existing relationships with crypto-currency exchanges.
 The letter from the Governor pointed out that “Cryptocurrencies can be used to facilitate tax evasion as well as the externalization of funds in violation of a country’s laws.”
 Adding that “any person who buys, sells, or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country.”
 Zimbabwe is home to Golix, one of the most prominent crypto-companies in Africa.
 When you follow the cryptocurrency conversation across the continent, you realize that actions by Zimbabwes reserve bank are not in isolation. Theres a pattern.
 The South African government, one of the first across Africa to realize the potential of cryptocurrencies, in 2014, published a white paper on virtual currencies.
 Also, read: Uganda to host one of the biggest blockchain conferences in Africa
 Through its central bank, South African Reserve Bank, it attempted to explain its stance on virtual currencies. Which many understand as cryptocurrencies.
 Titled “Position Paper on Virtual Currencies”, the paper gave background and “[clarified] concepts pertinent to the virtual currency discussion and drew a distinction between various categories of virtual currencies.
 Additionally, the paper also “highlight[ed] several immediate risks associated with the current virtual currency landscape, in particular, the decentralized convertible virtual currencies, and concludes with the Bank’s position and responsibility in this regard as well as a caution to users of virtual currencies.”
 The bank concluded by admitting that it “does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC [Virtual Currency] landscape”. And cautioning the users that “all activities [regarding cryptocurrencies] are performed at the end users sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.”
 But, it also made it clear that “VCs pose no significant risk to financial stability, price stability or the National Payment System.” Though, fast forward, the government made attempts to start taxing Bitcoin holders.
 In January 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a circular cautioning the banks and financial institutions on the Virtual Currencies. Saying that “transaction in VCs are largely untraceable and anonymous. This, the central bank believed will lead to “abuse by criminals” especially in “money laundering and financing of terrorism.”
 The Guardian, one of Nigeria’s leading papers, highlighted Nigeria’s interest in introducing a virtual currency. That was in October 2017. But, in February 2018, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a follow-up circular. Further distancing itself from cryptocurrencies. The Acting Director of Communications, Isaac Okarofor, who issued the circular wrote that;
 
 “Further to the circular issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on January 12, 2017, to Banks and other financial institutions on virtual currency operations in Nigeria, the Bank wishes to reiterate that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ripples, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Onecoin, etc and Exchanges such as NairaEx are not licensed or regulated by the CBN.”
 
 The circular was just an official cementing of the position of the government after the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria had earlier been quoted describing Bitcoin as a gamble. “Cryptocurrency or bitcoin is like a gamble, and there is a need for everybody to be very careful,” Independent quoted him.
 Despite the fact that Bitcoin was among one of the most searched topics in Nigeria in 2017, there seems no clear indication that the Nigerian government is looking at understanding the crypto field further. And, focus on regulating.
 Though, as it is currently, according to Balogun Harold, trading in cryptocurrencies in the West African nation isn’t illegal. “For investors and businessmen looking to set up cryptocurrency services/ businesses in Nigeria, crypto-businesses are generally permissible under Nigerian law,” it wrote.
 In Kenya, while as the governor Central Bank of Kenya described Bitcoin as a pyramid scheme in November 2017.
 According to The Standard, a Kenyan Newspaper, the governor issued the same warnings in 2015 about cryptocurrencies. Despite the fact that Kenya has set up a Blockchain Committee, which ideally covers Cryptocurrencies, the Central Bank of Kenya issued a letter warning all Banks in Kenya about cryptocurrencies. That was in April 2018.
 Tanzania, a country that’s looking to charge bloggers and digital publishers over US $900, hasn’t been very vocal about cryptocurrencies. Though, in October 2017, the Governor Bank of Tanzania warned Tanzanians about “the risks associated with digital currencies.”
 Though, he cast a positive remark by saying that “we know about cryptocurrencies, but as a government, we want to study it so we can understand it better.” Adding that “we are now working to see if we should allow it, regulate it or ban it. We are still studying the matter and looking at it very closely before taking any further measures.”
 Uganda, the country that wants to tax social media users as well as charge Mobile Money users to the bone, has mixed reactions from the government. In February 2017, the Bank of Uganda issued a warning to the public against OneCoin.
 The central bank warned that “whoever wishes to invest their hard earned savings in Cryptocurrency forms” was “taking a risk in the financial space where there is neither investor protection nor regulatory purview.”

On his visit to Uganda, the president assured him of his commitment to working with Binance to ensure that Uganda becomes “a global Blockchain destination.” Museveni is also expected to speak at the African Blockchain Conference taking place in Uganda next week.
 In Ghana, the Central Bank came out at the beginning of 2018 and said that “Bitcoin is not yet legal”.
 While the Egyptian government was suspected to be using local internet users to secretly mine cryptocurrency in March 2018. Despite a well-respected religious leader, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam, criticizing cryptocurrencies in January 2018.
 The Mufti issued “an official fatwa (Islamic ruling) on January 1, 2018. It forbade the trade of bitcoins deeming them haram (against religious teachings).” According to Egypt Today.

"Spanish delivery startup Glovo expands to Kenya after Egypt and Morocco
","Glovo, a Barcelona based logistics, e-commerce and delivery startup, has expanded to Nairobi Kenya. This comes after they recently launched in Egypt and Morocco.
 The Spanish startup is currently testing its operations in Westlands and Kilimani according to Marek Zmysłowski. Though, apart from that, there are no any other indicators of their launch in Kenya.
 Glovo is a hybrid of e-commerce and logistics. Look at it as a marketplace for independent riders  called Glovers  and products  called Gloves. Call it an Uber for products and riders. Or a Jumia that doesnt own the riders.
 That way, they allow one to order anything  a phone charger, food, a smoothie, a hot meal etc  and have it delivered.
 Also read: MTN is considering selling off its 40% stake in Jumia
 So far they have signed up merchants for some of their sections. Including supermarkets, restaurants and cafes. Naivas, Burrito Bar, Debonairs Pizza and Savanna Coffee Lounge are some of them.
 Theres no doubt that Glovo is likely to become the key competitor to Jumia. Given that they are offering services that compete with Jumia in all verticals. Except for travel.
 Founded in 2015, the startup has raised at least €152.1 million in total funding to date from six funding rounds.
 In July this year, they raised their latest round  a €115 million Series C from Rakuten, Seaya Ventures and other existing investors. So far, it has one acquisition under their belt  Foodinho, an Italian food delivery startup.

"Startup Profile: Teheca &#8211; Your Health Needs Sorted
","What is Teheca?
 TEHECA is a patient care firm and launched its operations in 2015. It later got incorporated in Uganda in January 28th 2016.
 Its main objective is to provide compassionate, caring and qualified patient care assistance and personal care aides for the sick, elderly and special needs. However, it has since grown to add onto its already existing line of services, post natal and psychiatric care services to the Ugandan community from both home or in hospitals.
 Solution
 The Teheca team believes that it is impossible to be in two places at the same time. When you have sick loved one at home or at hospital, you would want to be cork sure that they are in the right hands when you personally cant be there for them.
 Finding the right person to entrust your loved ones with is a nerve wrecking experience. You have to worry about whether they are the right fit, qualified or if they will be caring enough.
 In Uganda, medical professionals are spending less and lesser time with their patients. This sometimes results in the patients feeling neglected.

 Thoughts
 Teheca is a good idea. But, as they hinted in their challenges, Uganda is yet to appreciate such a service. Given the extended family type of nature we currently have, one can easily pick a relative  who is unemployed  from the village to come and take care of their elderly mother, father or relative in need.
 Therefore, enough awareness has to be done to change mindsets of people. Masses need to believe that they need a professional rather than just any other person to help their relatives in need.

"Innovation Village Co-Founder Invited for Forbes Under 30 Summit in Boston, Africa Angel Investors Summit in Cape Town
","The fourth Forbes annual Under 30 Summit will take place in Boston next month from October 1-4, 2017. The summit aims at bringing together more than 6,000 young entrepreneurs and game-changers from around the world, as culled from the Forbes 30 Under 30 lists, as well as a wide range of CEOs, founders, leaders, mentors, investors, and disruptors, according to this Forbes article.
 What is interesting is that one of the people to attend the event is Ugandas CK Japheth, a co-founder at the Innovation Village. CK revealed this information to us in a conversation we had on the future of the startup ecosystem in Uganda and Africa.
 During the same conversation, he also informed us that he was invited for the upcoming Africa Angel Investor Summit taking place in Cape Town this coming November. The summit is organized by the Africa Business Angel Network in partnership with Venture Capitalists for Africa, South Africa Business Angel Network as well as the city of Cape Town.
 In our conversation with CK Japheth, we were able to explore what this means not only to him but the entire ecosystem of Uganda.

 Forbes Under 30 Summit Invitation
 In his perspective, the world is watching what each and everyone is doing. He says the world is always on the lookout for young people out there who are giving their best.
 Especially young people whore building relevant solutions. Those who are out there to change the world. Thats what that tells me and those whore out there to change the world, he adds.
  to the Young Entrepreneurs.
 When you look at the hubs and co-working spaces around Kampala, the majority are occupied or roamed by young men and women below the age of 35 years. This implies that even the people they occasionally get in contact with are in their age bracket.
 When I asked CK what his invitation signals to these hungry entrepreneurs that lack who to look up to, he re-echoed his first message. Which is, they should continue doing what theyre doing but also know that the world is watching if theyre onto something.
 He added that if youre onto a path of impact and confident, keep at it. It is not easy thats why the 99% of the people are in a safe job elsewhere. But, if you decide that yours is an entrepreneurial journey, then keep at it. Sooner or later, something will give way.
 Another implication, to him, is that for those who have dedicated their lifes work to supporting young entrepreneurs, it is very rewarding if that work is recognized on a global scale even if in Uganda, it is not recognized at all.
 Being recognized on a global scale means that not all hope is lost. And there are people out there who want to collaborate with people whore doing amazing things here, he added.

 To the Innovation Village 
 In several of the conversations I have had with CK, he has always said that the Innovation Village has been bootstrapped to the maximum. And, he thinks that what is standing between it and self-sustainability is the absence of venture capital. He also thinks its the same hinderance for the startups in Kampala.
 So, I asked him whether Boston might be the solution to this dilemma and he was quick to say definitely it is. He had actually contacted a couple of Venture Capitalists that have already invested heavily in Kenyas ecosystem.
 There was positive feedback from them about setting up meetings as well as picking up conversations based on what were doing and what theyre looking for, he added.
 He continued to emphasize that the beauty is, theyre looking for entrepreneurs whore delivering impact, changing the world but also with a business mindset. In his opinion, theyre not looking for grantpreneurs  which means someone always focused on grant investment.
 Any Other benefits?
 When asked to highlight other benefits that his invitation may present both to him and the Ugandan startup ecosystem, he went on to identify a few.
 One of the benefits he pointed out is definitely expanding his network. The network he can use to create big opportunities for what we are doing as well as take the message out there and get people on board which is a very very direct benefit, he added.

 For him, as an entrepreneur in an ecosystem that is early, he also still needs to expand his worldview. This will help him understand who is out there, what are they doing, what are their interests, what are the global shifts, how do we localize those global shifts to create an advantage for the industry, for the community, and for the entrepreneurs here locally.
 And, according to the way he sees it, it is really about how do you tap into global opportunities to expand local initiatives that we are working on.
 Which Startups?
 In this medium post, CK Japheth writes about something that he re-echoes almost whenever he is talking about the Ugandan startup Ecosystem.
 He was asked how many startups in Uganda have attracted funds externally and gone on to grow regionally? by a person he described as a brilliant Indian-American venture capitalist working with the IFC.
 Yet, he was telling me that he was hopeful his Boston trip might be of help to attract venture capital into Kampala. So, I decided to make reference to his own words and experience.
 He admitted that we are still struggling to find that startup that has raised external funds, grown regionally and therere some that are in that bracket but that can also be questioned further.
 However, he continued to say that he thinks he has discovered the biggest challenge that startups in the country are facing.  He called it the problem of poor or lack of storytelling. In his opinion, we do not know how to tell our stories as well as our impact.
 Because, we have entrepreneurs that are doing very impactful and awesome work in terms of technology, social entrepreneurship as well as other fields of entrepreneurship, he added.
 To clarify his point, he said that what the entrepreneurs are doing is like lighting a candle and then place a bucket over it yet expect the world to know what theyre doing.
 I read a Kenyan newspaper, Business Daily, and you look at who gets funded in there. For the past two weeks, when you look at the people I have read about [getting funding], I know people in Uganda whore doing that [same work] plus more, he points out.
 He concluded this by saying a lot is happening but people have just covered a bucket over the crazy stuff that theyre doing, thats an aspect we have to explore more.
 Probably the more we help lift the profile and visibility of these entrepreneurs then we shall increase the money raised externally and also grow out into the region, he suggested.
 The Hub model is broken
 Apart from the fact that no hub is self-sustaining in Africa, theres none that can claim to have produced at least 5 regionally exciting startups in the past 5 years. This was a subject of interest, and when asked if whoever hell be talking to about the Innovation Village idea wont bring it up.
 This was a subject of interest, and when asked if whoever hell be talking to about the Innovation Village idea wont bring it up.
 CK admits it and says hes absolutely sure that the hub model doesnt work. Thats why we keep saying that the innovation village is not a hub. It is an ecosystem. We are trying to put in place everything an entrepreneur needs to build their venture, from one destination.
 He also adds that theres no self-sustaining hub in Africa, very few in the world and most are subsidized. But he says that whenever youre talking to an investor, VC or anyone who invests in early-stage startups about a hub, theyre not really interested in the business of the hub. Theyre more interested in the startups in there.
 Jamie from EDTECH Capetown who guarantees $80K for any education tech solution
 Which takes us back to the catch 22 question of how many startups in Uganda have attracted funds externally and gone on to grow regionally? Though, in this case, is how many startups in the Innovation Village must an investor know about?
 And, indeed, CK anticipates such questions will come up. Thats why his focus will mainly be spotlighting the startups and entrepreneurs that they are working with and the solutions theyre building according to the different sectors and labs.
 Africa Angel Investors Summit.
 To sum up the conversation, we quickly talked about his invitation to the African Angel Investors Summit in Cape Town.
 When asked, again, what this invitation means to him and the investment climate in the country, CK said that he was pleased to get invited to the Africa Angel Investors Summit.
 But, he attributed this invitation to the work theyre doing with Kampala Angel Investors Network. This is a local Angel Investor network that was started because we realized that you can not build entrepreneurs without the financing, he added.
 To him, the beauty with the summit invitation is that it creates confidence in foreign capital that you can actually go and invest in Uganda.
 And again, he added that this is an opportunity to expand the worldview of how it is done, expanding the network and taking the message out there that theres a country called Uganda with startups you can invest in.
 Because, if you look at who is attending the summit, he is the only person from Uganda  as far as he knows. To which he adds that we need to continuously drum that message such that we are creating the right focus and attention for startups from here.
 In conclusion
 The Ugandan startup ecosystem is still young but growing at a very fast rate. Once given the attention it deserves, it shall be able to grow to match the level of others across the continent if not leapfrog them.

"When should a startup be regarded as African?
","On March 1, 2017, I launched a blog called Startup Digest Africa (which later became Digest Africa). The goal was to tell stories of high-growth early-stage African businesses that had the potential to become pan-African.
 Through that, my thinking was that we would help close the huge gap that exists between African businesses as well as those in other parts of the world. As we told their stories, we would help them attract funding, partnerships as well as customers and users.
 Yet, over time, as I have continued to cover this space, one thing has stayed consistently confusing to some people: What is an African startup? What is an African business?
 Despite the African startup ecosystem coming of age, many have still struggled to come up with the correct definition and it is understandable. The reason is simple; unlike most parts of the world, Africa is very much fragmented with many loopholes  like lack of strict competition authorities  that are easy to exploit, especially with globalization falling upon us, making it easy and luring for one to start a global company right away.
 In this Harvard Business Review article released in the 1999 issue, Bruce Kogut ponders what makes a company global as he gave a brief summary of the book The Myth of the Global Corporation by Paul N. Doremus, William W. Keller, Louis W. Pauly, and Simon Reich.
 He paused some questions: It is one thing to say that the markets of the world are coming together, he started. But are global markets creating globally minded companies? Are we seeing the emergence of rootless corporations guided only by market opportunities, not by allegiance to their home countries?
 Before  partly because of the hardships that entailed starting and growing business across the continent  many started businesses across Africa but the most scale they could achieve was making it a regional multinational. However, over time, we have seen companies with a global mindset emerge from the onset  Flutterwave, Paga, Jumo et al. Even if some of these dont end up achieving that feat, most start out structured in a way that can allow them to easily scale and achieve that ambition.
 One of the ways to become a global company is how and where you raise your capital, the way you incorporate and structure yourself. That is why we have seen companies incorporate in Delaware, the United Kingdom, Mauritius et al.
 It just happens that we are now in a globalized economy where one can operate a rootless company (with no national allegiance)  instead, with interests spread across the globe. This is because different countries or states offer different incentives for the companys different needs. That is why we have devices designed in California but manufactured in Shenzhen. That is why we have companies operated in Johannesburg but domiciled in the Cayman Islands or Mauritius.
 Now, going back to the question we started with: What makes a startup African? Is it the incorporation, the skin colour of the founder, the nationality of the founder(s) or the language that the founders speak?
 Yesterday, we released our research brief of the African startups that have raised at least $20 million in VC funding in a single round. Many people commented on the list suggesting that we should have not included some if not most of them.
 
 But, what does one use to classify a startup as either African or not? Or if it is just a startup in Africa?
 For example, if Jason Njoku and Bastian Gotter start iROKO TV that is carrying Nollywood (and other African) content but incorporated in the UK, do you regard it African or not? What if a white Canadian immigrant starts a company called Numida and incorporates/headquarters it in Uganda, does it qualify to be an African startup or not? What if an American decides to headquarter Fenix International and keep all her CXOs in Uganda, is it regarded African or not?
 What is even more confusing is, what if a US-born Ghanaian starts a company, raises funding from (mostly) US investors, maintains the headquarters in Ghana but incorporates both in the US and Mauritius? Where does that company belong? Ghana, Mauritius or the US? Is it an African or Global company?
 Those are questions we ask ourselves on a daily basis as we carry out research on African startups or startups in Africa  depending on which term you are comfortable with. Yet, our commitment is to standardize things to a level that you should be able to digest and make decisions quickly. Keep in mind that we do all this in an imperfect market that is marred with a lot of information asymmetry.
 What we decided as the Digest Africa team was to boil everything down to the unit economics. What do I mean by this? Where do the economic benefits of that startup or companys existence go? I am not talking about shareholder benefits because that is very complicated (for now) to keep track of. Instead, we are talking of taxes, job creation and other benefits that come with a particular company being in existence.
 If Andela  though founded by people from different continents  raises $100 million, which economy will it likely go into? If a Kenyan-born entrepreneur starts a startup in the US and has all its workforce there, where will all the economic benefits of that startups existence go?
 That is why we decided to base our current definition of an African startup on where its headquarters are located or what its primary or only market of focus is.
 The main reason  as explained in our methodology  for settling with this is because (for now) we havent achieved the level of market information saturation that can allow us to base our allocation of a companys economic benefits basing on shareholder value or incorporation. However, headquarters and primary market of focus, give us a hint on where their main interest lies.
 In conclusion, I would like to hear from any other individuals or companies that have or are currently carrying out research about African startups and find out the challenges that you are experiencing as well as how you are navigating the numerous and often challenging classifications. You can reach me on malinz@digestafrica.com.

"Kenya&#8217;s Cellulant raised the $47.5M at a $105M valuation
","In May last year, Kenyan financial services company  Cellulant  announced that it had raised a $47.5 million Series C led by TPG’s Rise Fund. There were no further details disclosed regarding the terms of the deal at the time.
 However, according to the filings by Cellulant with the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) in a notice last week  as reported by Business Daily  the fintech sold a 44.4% stake at a 10.8 billion Kenyan Shillings valuation. When converted to the US dollar, the company was valued at approximately $105 million.
 The Rise Fund made the investment in Cellulant together with Endeavor Catalyst, a co-investment fund that specialises in growth equity investments, and Satya Capital, an independent venture firm with a focus on African business.  The companys list of shareholders also includes Velocity Capital Private Equity, Progression Capital Africa Limited and TBL Mirror Fund.
 Also read: Why are African startups launching in multiple countries before they even hit seed stage funding?
 Cellulants $47.5 million raised last year was the highest raised by a Kenyan technology company in 2018 according to Digest Africa Deals data.
 Founded in 2004, Cellulant is among the companies in Africa with the highest level of scale on the continent, with operations in at least 8 African countries. Yet, the valuation indicates the level of scale needed for an African company to attract a significant valuation.
 Jumia, with operations in 20+ African countries, is said to be one of the continents most valued early-stage tech companies with a valuation hovering $1 billion. Last year, CB Insights also released its unicorn focused report which indicated that there were only three unicorns in Africa  Jumia included.

"UCC excites Twitter users with the announcement of a new national postcode and address system
","On the 7th November, Uganda Communications Commission  UCC  announced that a new national postcode and address system is being worked on. This, the tweet, says is aimed at reforming and modernizing the delivery of postal services in the country.
 
 #Uganda is developing a national #postcode &amp; address system aimed at reforming &amp; modernising the delivery of postal services in the country.
 — UCC (@UCC_Official) November 7, 2017
 
 UCC recently released the industry report [pdf] for the second quarter from April-June 2017. It is a summary of the analysis done on the market and industry.
 The data used is largely extracted from the operational reports of licensees in Ugandas Communications Industry for the period April to June 2017 according to UCC. It was on the back of this that the communications regulator made the announcement.
 Currently, according to the report, there are 8,5 and 11 international, regional and domestic courier services in Uganda. However, their operations are hindered by the poor postcode and address system.
 The same issue makes running an e-commerce platform  that entirely depends on a well set-up address system  to run smoothly.
 Currently, leading e-commerce platforms have had to rely on traditional descriptions methods to make deliveries. It is not strange to use next to, before this or after that as the descriptions for where a package is to be delivered.
 One of the Twitter fans hinted on Arvana  an application that got a grant from ResilientAfrica Network to work on solving the address issue in the country. Though, their team lead got hired by Andela mid-this year. (See also: ResilientAfrica Network Is Not Closing, We Did Not Receive all the $25 Million – Dr. Mayega).
 Several Twitter users came in with positive messages that were mainly congratulatory  to applaud the move. Though, others had some feedback to chip in with. Something UCC took in with pleasure.
 
 About time we get modernised! Great steps thank you. I am glad I will soon be omitting our mango tree as part of the directions to my house!

 This is awesome. But when I look at Katanga + others I just shake my head.

 Interesting observation. But I guess we need to start some as a country. Our colleagues will find us on the way.

 @UCC_Official believe me you need to educate Ugandans on the personal benefits of postal services itself  esp given this electronic age.

"The future is looking brighter for African chatbots solutions
","Businesses in Africa are beginning to explore what more they can do with the internet. Beyond social media presence and having a website. Entrepreneurs are also looking at how to solve problems by plugging in existing infrastructure. And, there’s seems to be one area they are all picking interest in. Chatbots.
 Last week, at the F8 conference, Mark Zuckerberg said:
 “Facebook has seen good momentum for messenger business with more than 300,000 business bots and 8 billion messages exchanged between them and users.”
 He went ahead and cited an example of United Bank for Africa’s Leo. A chatbot that “enables customers to make use of their social media accounts to carry out key banking transactions.”
 
 “People are now spending more time in messaging apps than in social media and that is a huge turning point. Messaging apps are the platforms of the future and bots will be how their users access all sorts of services.” — Peter Rojas, Entrepreneur in Residence at Betaworks
 
 UBA is not alone. In the recent past, there has been a series of chatbots developed from across the continent.
 South Africa’s ABSA launched its ABSA ChatBanking bot in July 2016. To “let customers conduct banking without having to leave the social media platform.”
 Budapest-based Hungarian start-up, UXstudio, also developed Nuru, a chatbot to “meet the needs of people in Kenya and Ghana.” This includes “searching for seasonal jobs”, calculating “current market prices” as well as “daily tips on how to live a healthier life”.
 South African-based BotsZa also has two bots Keirabot &amp; Haziebot. The company says that it provides solutions in hotel reservations, flight booking, e-commerce, banking, finance, and insurance, as well as customer care services.
 In Uganda, a group of entrepreneurs developed Panya. The chatbot worked for both Facebook messenger and Telegram. It allowed one to “order an Uber, search for jobs, do their shopping” as well as “receive the news”.
 Towards the end of last year, Quartz Africa reported that World Food Program, WFP, was “using chatbots to beat world hunger.” The United Nations, UN, the agency was exploring the use of chatbots to asses food needs in areas its operating.
 Also read: Why other African governments need to adopt Tunisia’s startup act
 “This year, they expanded to using chatbots on the Facebook messenger platform. Approximately 170 million Africans use Facebook, mostly on their phones,” wrote Quartz Africa.
 So far, there are some successes among those who have built chatbots as solutions.
 Last week, Ventureburn reported that “Canadian social enterprise firm 1001 Squared Artificial Intelligence has acquired a Nigerian AI-enabled chatbot and SMS-based directory service QuickHelp for an undisclosed amount.”
 According to Maxime Biyen from GSMA, “out of the 65 start-ups that pitched at Seedstars, 12 are actually using chatbots in one way or another.”
 “Startups using chatbots include Gifted Mom’s ‘healthcare bot’ (Cameroon), Langbot‘s gamified language teaching chatbot (Ethiopia) and 3oun using a chatbot to assist its users to find handymen in Jordan.”  Maxime Biyen.
 All the above events signal a bright future for chatbot based ventures in Africa. Especially, when the continent is touted to be mobile first. An attribute thats key to the adoption of chatbots. Plus, with an expected over half a billion smartphones by 2020, a great opportunity lies ahead.

"INTERVIEW: Aga Sekalala Jr is setting up an Angel/VC fund in Uganda, the first by a Ugandan
","At the beginning of this year, I met Aga Sekalala Jr  for the very first time  at an event organized by Kampala Angel Investors Network at The Innovation Village. It is from there that I learned he was setting up a fund to invest in technology companies in Uganda.
 This is not only the first by a Ugandan, it is the only one  to the best of my knowledge.
 If you have no idea of who Aga Sekalala Jr is, he is the founder of Radio Simba. One of the country’s leading radio stations (and my best Luganda radio station). He also founded Ugachick and has interest in a couple of other businesses and ventures.
 Worth noting is that Aga also sits on the boards of KCB Bank, Uganda Investment Authority, and Uganda Manufacturers Association. Additionally, he holds a BSC in Chemical Engineering from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, USA and an Alumni of Harvard Business School.
 I had a sit down with him and he told me more about Rochas Capital LLP, the investment fund, as well as why he decided to go in that direction. It was an interesting conversation but has been edited for the sake of rhythm and to make it shorter for easier digesting. Enjoy.
 Malinz: What is Rochas capital?
 Aga Sekalala: Rochas capital is a hybrid of an Angel investment and a Venture Capital fund. It is a collection of funds mainly from high net-worth individuals that have put together some money for investment. Especially in the tech sector.
 The idea is; Commercial ventures that need to grow from idea to commercialization, and also those that are a little commercial that requires capital to grow to scale. Another thing that Rochas Capital does is that it does not provide money only. But also provide a pool of expertise in the field of finance.
 There are people with a lot of commercial or legal experience [in Rochas Capital]. There are [also] people with operational knowledge, marketing and [the experience of] building [a business from the ground up]. People with all these skills that are required to put a business up to speed.
 And so what we do is bring those skills and experiences close and we will apply them if we can find a business that is interested and also a deal that makes sense to us.
 But we will probably not deal with a business that is not sure and one that maybe not be fully operational and has [potential for only] hundreds or thousands of customers. We are looking at the high growth [potential] sector.
 Most of us here clone the US market because we are using their definitions. So when you say high net worth individual, what is your definition?
 These are like-minded people that are interested in putting a little bit of money into the next generation of entrepreneurs. There is no specific definition.
 But, these people have some savings, and they also have some skills. So, over the years, they have accumulated some skills which they have reached fully, but they also have some savings which they would like to invest in some high growth [potential startup] opportunities where they exist.
 Its a tough market, it is very devoid of very good commercial activities and ideas but nevertheless, it is an interesting market. We set up this entity now to try and see if we can seriously take advantage if an opportunity does exist.
 You talked of Rochas being at the intersection of an Angel and VC fund. Does that have a limit to how much you can put in a venture?
 Yes. It does create a bit of a limit on how much we can put [into a round]. We would not subscribe to invest in five million dollars for instance. We believe that we need to try and get more opportunities for the size of deals that are available on the ground.
 We think of ourselves really in the range of anywhere from $50,000 to $500,000. And maybe 750,000 or $1,000,000. It seems to be a good range for us. [Though] we [would] like to partner with other firms and have other several funds abroad that we tend to call in to be able to match funds.
 So they [first] want to know that there is a local fund, and that is where the interest has come from.
 We run into a lot of people in our daily work who are interested in investing here but they want a local fund to provide local leadership and guidance. They want people who know the local environment and the landscape and the local networks.
 So if somebody is going to invest 3 million dollars or 2 million dollars in a local business, they want to know [that] there is a local firm that is also putting in some money. Thats the role we think we will play.
 We think that we will be able to provide a level of governance and management in a local business to attract even foreign firms once they know that there are some serious partners within their venture.
 How can one join Rochas? As a Limited or General Partner?
 We already have a general partner [but] it is a limited liability partnership. So, basically, what we do is that the way it is structured, the limited liability partnership enables us to be very flexible on how we operate.
 For each particular deal, we can actually set up a new set of partners. I serve as the general partner which means that normally I am at the center of most of the deals. But we have several other partners. So there might be a deal where a partner who did deal X is not interested in deal Y. They are free to sit out on deal Y.
 And thats a way the partnership gives us that flexibility. To be able to do newly structured things under separate partnerships within the same structure [but] without necessarily having the limitations of other types of entities that will be out there.
 For someone to join, do they necessarily have to be high net-worth individuals in Uganda or anyone from anywhere [as long as they are] interested?
 We are looking for like-minded individuals who are interested to invest in the long term. So we dont have really a limitation on who can join. Or why they should join or how they join. But the most important thing is that you have got to be a like-minded individual.
 You have got to be not only interested in investing money, you better be interested in the whole long run, the benefits, the offtake and what else can come out from some of these arrangements.
 Its about [the] big picture. We have got a lot of people who are interested to join. But like I said earlier, there is a limitation to what is available out there. A lot of ideas in the market are a copy and paste. When you listen to them, a lot of them dont have a lot of local traction. So it is [still] a bit of a challenge.
 But we think there will be ideas. A lot has already happened [so far] and we are very keen to find something that will work, and then it does not have to keep on trying.
 When did you exactly launch this and between then and now have you done any deals?
 Not really. We have been actually looking at three businesses. One is a very early stage, one has already finished its proof of concept and they have even done some trial rounds on [the] ground. Thats an interesting one.
 Then we are looking at another one which is active as a business but is looking to grow. They have got a good business model and it is interesting so we look at various things and then we sort of evaluate which one of them offers a long interesting thing.
 So we are very interested in the entrepreneurs behind the business. Thats very important for us. It’s actually 60%- 70% [of what we consider before investing]. If we dont think we are compatible with the entrepreneur we will leave them. We will leave it on the table.
 Which industries are these three startups in?
 These industries are all in tech and they are all a bit in the financial technology (fintech) space. Rochas Capital would like to specialize in that area. Although we are not excluding ourselves from other technology ideas.
 We look at ourselves as the team [that] understands fintech, and right now that seems to be the area that we are looking at.
 I know you have a lot of knowledge of the local Ugandan Market. Does that mean you are going to focus mainly on ventures that are here or started by local Ugandans?
 We think that this is a starting point. We have [our] ears on the ground in different markets [though]. But this is our home.
 Also read: VC firm Sobek Capital opens Rwandan office, to invest $10,000 to $250,000
 One of the interests that the group has is not just to make money. The issue is about how do we develop our own technology sector? How do we ensure that we can have a series of products that come out [of the country]? And what can I support? So we see some really interesting ideas and the issue sometimes is turning them into commercial [ventures]. How do you monetize them? How do you make money out of them?
 Being the only General Partner, you might be the only person who is going to be the fulcrum for Rochas Capital. Do you think you will have the time for all entrepreneurs and ventures Rochas will invest in?
 I dont know. I cant say right now. I dont see so many deals [coming in right now] that I might not have time for everybody. From what I can see is that extent not being that large [in the near future]. It could be different in a year, it could be different in 5 years. I cant predict the future.
 My view or my take may be that the idea will also be to replicate and perhaps learn how to manage some of these processes as we grow along. It’s also a learning process for us.
 How can we invest faster? It might be that eventually in future Rochas capital might be able to do investments where I am not the fulcrum. When I am not at the center of what’s going on. But my skills can still be passed on. I think what normally happens with these things is that you sort of learn as you go along.
 At the moment, it is very dependent on me. But I think that is only [for the] transit. At the end of the day, in all the businesses I have been involved, as the business grows, they become less dependent on me.
 As you have been here [at Radio Simba], I dont have an office [here]. And I think you realize that this business (the radio station) runs without me.
 Which year was Rochas started?
 We started this year [2018]. It was incorporated earlier in the year [but] it has been an idea that has been on our minds for the last couple of years. We have been looking at it, but [the] time was not right [then]. We believe that [right now] the opportunity is quite good.
 However, currently, we still have some challenges. I think that we have lately been getting a negative rating from the whole policy [thing]. The whole government policy and [mobile money and OTT] taxation policy.
 Right now, we are getting a very big red flag over us [from potential external partners] because people feel that the government is very unreliable from a tax point of view. They feel there is a lack of reliability and a lack of predictability  which is the most important thing.
 People [interested in partnering with us] need to know that these number that you project are able to last a long term.
 There is always a need for taxation [in a country], but there [also] needs to be a predictable way the taxation will work.
 Right now, the way it is looking, it is very easy to be one thing for at least 2 weeks, then in 3 weeks, it has changed to something else. So that is creating a little bit of an inward look.
 [Currently], we are getting a bit of a sit out [from potential partners] at the moment, and it has been there for the last two months. Even before these taxes were passed. We have had pretty much [of] a sit out [from them].
 Everybody has been waiting to see what is going to happen. So a lot of investors who would have partnered with us have been really [on] a wait and see. For instance, the mobile money sector is down quite substantially, people dont want to use the channel and so it affects everybody.

"Mobile subscriber growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has slowed, GSMA report
","GSMA, through GSMA Intelligence  its data and analysis arm  has released a report [PDF] which indicates that mobile subscriber growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is slowing down.
 Growth rates in the region have fallen well below the double-digit annual rates seen in the first half of the decade, and the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next five years is around half the level recorded over the preceding five years, the report noted.
 This is despite the fact that the region still has low penetration level as compared to the rest of the world.
 As at the end of 2017, the [mobile] subscriber base in the [sub-Saharan] region totalled [sic] 444 million, equivalent to around 9% of subscribers globally according to GSMA.
 Unique mobile subscriber penetration in Sub-Saharan Africa stood at 44% at the end of 2017, still well below the global average of 66%.
 This slowed growth is partly due to the challenges stemming from affordability as well as the burden of a youthful population. Which could be linked to the lack of disposable income as the continent still grapples with the ever-growing problem of youth unemployment.
 Subscriber growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has slowed in recent years as the industry
 confronts the challenges of affordability and a youthful population, the report said.
 Also read: There are 442 active tech hubs in Africa, GSMA 2018 report
 The mobile subscriber base for the sub-Saharan area is projected to continue with the slowed growth for the next half-decade. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next five years is around half the level recorded over the preceding five years, the report noted.
 The growth is anticipated to happen in rural areas mostly.
 
 Future growth opportunities will increasingly be concentrated in rural and low-ARPU markets, as well as younger demographic groups. World Bank data indicates that around 40% of the population in the region are under the age of 16, a demographic segment that has significantly lower levels of mobile ownership than the population as a whole.
 
 The report also pointed out that in the next 5 years, the region will rise from the current penetration level of 44% to 50% which would still be below the current global average of 66%.
 The regional subscriber base will grow at a CAGR of 4.8% for the period 2017–2022, more than double the global growth rate over the same period, the report noted.
 Adding that the penetration rate is forecast to reach the 50% level by the end of 2023, and 52% by 2025.
 Other noteworthy areas covered in the report are; the dawn of 5G in Africa, how much mobile is contributing to the sub-Saharan economy as well as how mobile is enabling the digital economy.

"SafeBoda Goes Cashless in Latest Update
","Earlier this week, Ugandas ride-hailing startup SafeBoda released a recent update of its app. However, the most captivating feature of the app is its ability to allow SafeBoda customers load credit using either MTN mobile money or Airtel Money.
 With this new feature, SafeBoda enables cashless rides for every boda trip. This new feature, which can be done in three simple steps, allows SafeBoda’s customers to just walk away at the end of their trip, thus removing the hassle of trying to find change.
 Combining this with upfront pricing, which removes the stress of having to bargain with the Boda Boda riders, SafeBoda is making itself one of the most convenient ways for one to get around Kampala.
 In order to use this new feature, existing customers will need to go to the Play Store to
 update their app to the latest version. Following that, they simply go to ‘Payment
 Options’ in the App Menu and follow the simple instructions to load their account.
 In an official press release we received, SafeBoda co-founder Maxime Dieudonné said, ‘this is the most exciting update we’ve made on the app to date. Our aim is to improve the boda experience for both customers and riders in terms of safety and convenience. Making trips cashless and removing the hassle of carrying change is a big step in that direction.’
 SafeBoda was founded in 2015 to provide a safe, more convenient, mobile-first alternative to urban transportation for Africa’s booming young population.

"Tunisia&#8217;s retail giant Magasin Général acquires e-commerce startup Founa
","Magasin Général (French for General Store), a leading retailer in Tunisia has acquired Founa. According to a local news site, they bought 80% stake in the startup. Though there are no details about the amount of the transaction.
 Founded in 2013 by Karim Skik, Founa.com is an online retailer specializing in the sale of consumer goods. The startup describes itself as Tunisias first online supermarket. Listing all its products at the average prices of supermarkets. It has over 11,000 products listed on the website and supports both online and cash on delivery payments.
 Founa also has its own fleet of delivery trucks and delivery team. Deliveries are currently in Greater Tunis, Nabeul, Hammamet, Sousse and Monastir. The startup  to-date  has more than 5,000 customers and realized in 2017 a turnover of 2.7 million Tunisian Dinars (~ $900,000).
 Magasin Général, a listed company on the Tunis Stock Exchange, became the market leader in 2012 with 66 stores. Since then, it has grown its number of outlets across Tunisia from 83 to 91 between 2016 and 2017.
 According to the financials released in August, they netted a profit of 9.22 million Tunisian Dinar (~$3.097 million) in the first half of 2018.
 
 It also had a 859.2 million Tunisian dinars (~ $285.6 million) turnover in 2017. Of which, it achieved a net profit of 82.19%. Rising from 12.14 million dinars (~ $4.078 million) in 2016 to 22.13 million dinars (~ $7.43 million) in 2017.
 
 The retail giant is moving to strengthen its foothold on Tunisias retail industry. In June this year, they signed a partnership with French AI startup, UntieNots.
 According to the agreement, UntieNots, specializing in the promotion and loyalty in retail, would analyze the purchase path of nearly one million customers of the brand through its AI technology called Retail Analytics .

 This would enable operational segmentation and identify the main vocation of each store of the brand. In the end, they would be able to customize their offer and services according to customer expectations.
 Magasin Générals acquisition of Founa comes almost a year after Zinox  an offline store  acquired  Konga. It, thus, is likely going to become a trend that  in order for one to seamlessly do e-commerce in Africa, they need a strong offline presence. This calls for mergers with existing retailers. Except for companies like Jumia and Takealot  that do have the financial muscle.

"INTERVIEW: We processed over £140 Million for 2,000 Global Companies, expanded to 18 African countries &#8211; Kenneth Ntende, DusuPay CEO &#038; Co-founder
","Last year, DusuPay facilitated over £140,000,000 for “over 2,000 Global Businesses.” In the same year, the payments gateway startup which was started in 2015 with the aim of “simplifying the way the world does business with Africa expanded to 18 African countries  with the 18th being South Africa.
 In a conversation with Kenneth Ntende, a co-founder and CEO of Dusupay, he was able to tell us more about the journey.
 Startup Digest Africa: This sounds a little bit generic but I will ask it anyway, why did you start DusuPay?
 Kenneth Ntende: My background is typically in Economics. Therefore, as an Economist, I think the African economy is a bit broken down. You [in Uganda] can easily have clients in Kenya but how do you actually get money out of those clients?
 So, we are building a platform that makes finance seamless. In that, regardless of where the payment is coming from or where it is going, a business can easily collect the funds as well as pay out people regardless of where theyre on the African continent.
 Yes, one would say that Visa and Mastercard are good. But, theyre only covering 2-3% of the market. How about the other 97+ percent? How are they getting involved in the entire payments ecosystem? Thats what we are trying to address.
 SDA: You talked about Visa &amp; Mastercard and I agree with you that they’re not satisfying the market need. But, theres Flutterwave. What makes you different from them?
 KN: Flutterwave is a good company. I know the CEO and hes my personal friend. Theyre good in Nigeria. But, we are a company that has more coverage. You also have to understand that we started from a mobile money economy. So, it is hard for someone that has come from the U.S to build infrastructure for an African continent.
 Theyre built out of an economy thats fully banking. Its like someone coming from the U.S to make a product to cater for people in Busia [Uganda]. I think someone based out of that [Busia] region would have more strengths in putting that [product] to life than an outsider.
 SDA: Talking about that, do you think it is now up to people that have been in Africa longer to develop solutions for Africa?
 KN: I definitely think so. No one comes to your home and makes [perfect] products for you. So, it makes more sense [to have people that have lived in Africa longer develop these products].
 What Africa is forgetting is that we need to make products for Africa. Because no one else in the world is going to make products for Africa. They also have their own problems. So, why would they come down to Africa to solve your problems?
 SDA: But people that have been in Africa longer may know the problems and challenges theyre going through. They probably have the solution, yet as you may know, they are facing challenges when it comes to developing those solutions and bring them to market. Theres expertise, funding, a narrow network and others. How can one hack through that?
 KN: People say those problems are [only] in Africa but even the people in the other parts of the world had similar problems. They are not looking at businesses in China and the U.S that had to go through that.
 Even the people from Google had to first hassle down the road to start from garages to make their products come to life. So, I dont think it is an Africa [only] problem. I think it is an actual global problem. So, it is just a matter of how you work through it. Just like everyone else in the world.
 SDA: But, someone would argue that China has grown mainly because of the government support. Similar case for the U.S., something you can hardly say about Africa.
 KN: I dont think thats the case. What people are looking at is what is happening right now. Have they looked at what was happening in the U.S at the time Google and Facebook were taking shape?
 [At] the time Alibaba was taking shape, was the government [of China] supportive? The government only came in after seeing that you know what, actually there are some people that have put something out there that are literally making sense.
 So, what they shouldnt focus on is the now after things have taken shape in all those varying economies. But rather what, it was back then. And, Africa is at that same time just like 1994 when everyone was just getting started. That is the time Africa is at.
 So, you dont expect your government to come and show a lot of support before theres proof of concept. Thats what it was back then in all those economies before any government and a private investor came in.
 SDA: Then, I think I will go fast forward to last year. How was it for DusuPay, in brief?
 KN: Last year was good. We processed around £148 Million pounds. But we are just getting started. So, we are quickly trying to get to about a billion pounds. We are trying to position ourselves as the guys that every multi-million dollar corporation comes to when theyre transacting with Africa.
 So, you start with one betting company. You go to another money remittance company and then after some time, the rest will also realize that Visa and Mastercard dont work fine for Africa.
 The only other service provider they have is either us or Flutterwave. Considering the scale and the mileage we have [present in 18 African countries] and Flutterwave [present in 3]. So, theres a huge distinction. Thats why many people are now starting to move from Flutterwave to DusuPay. Like I said, there are not so many players. So it is just one of the two.
 SDA: But then someone would argue that Flutterwave has taken the biggest chunk of the market. Because, last year they handled over $2 Billion, and 90% of that came from the Nigerian Market. What do you think?
 KN: A short-sighted person would look at it that way. DusuPay has only gotten into its concept in 2016. Yet, Flutterwave started with backing from Y Combinator. So they had that early traction and luckily they closed Uber.
 Uber is the company that is bringing in the bulk of their revenues. So, if someone is looking over time, the person that has more countries, more coverage is the one that’ll count. Yes, theyre big in Nigeria. But we have entered the Nigerian market [in 2017] and already giving them a run for their money, in their own country.
 So, over time, I think the person that will win the battle is the person that has more scale and has grown better, faster and more effectively. In the short run, I would say yes, they processed more money than us in Nigeria but we are not looking at short term. We are looking at how do we dominate the African continent and I think we have a strong chance of doing that.
 SDA: Talking about your incorporation. Are you incorporated in Uganda or the UK?
 KN: We are incorporated in every country we are operating in. We opened up in Nigeria, and we had to register, we are in South Africa [going live in South Africa this week] and also registered there. So, every local subsidiary must have a local organization. We must have local operations.
 But, just to govern the whole entity, we have a UK enterprise that owns all the varying local subsidiaries. So, if it is DusuPay Uganda it is owned by our UK entity.
 Typically, we are born in Uganda but it is just for governance purposes and investor relations that we chose the UK for the governing enterprise. But ideally, we are a Ugandan company. We are born here. Most of the team is here.
 
 SDA: So, where would you say your headquarters are?
 KN: I think thats a question we cant answer now. Because we are also still contemplating where best to put it. Every economy has its advantages.
 For example, we have the UK because of the Investor relations, South Africa because every other organization we work with, from Nedbank to MTN, is based out of South Africa. Uganda also has its own relevance, because it is where we started from.
 [Though] we are maintaining all of them, but yet to choose where the ideal headquarters will be. At the moment, we have South Africa, Uganda, and the UK as our three bases of operation.
 SDA: Talking about investor relations. What are some of the benefits that come with being registered in the UK?
 KN: People trust the UK. Yes, I know we love our Uganda, but also [need to] understand what the political climate is. Some investors are under the impression that they will give you £10 Million and the government just takes it away. Therefore, they need an economy they would rely on and know that if the funds are there, it would be safe and no one would come to tamper with that.
 You have to understand that our economies are not so wealthy. Our GDP [as Uganda] is just $25 Billion. So, they are also worried about sending money in an economy thats poor because of just what could happen to that money just in case it is sent.
 SDA: So, do you think this is likely to change over time? Where African governments will have a more investor-friendly climate.
 KN: I think it will. Because we are seeing some economies already pulling some strides towards this. An economy like Rwanda is pulling some milestones to make their economy more investors friendly. It is evolving. But at the end of the day, there are so many factors that need to align in order for it to make sense.
 SDA: You also talked about the fact that you facilitated over £148 Million pounds last year, what are some of the companies that contributed to this figure?
 KN: Most of them are betting companies. The biggest is 1X Bet. We also have Hollywood Bets  the company that sponsors the Hollywood Bets Dolphins, 138.com, Africabet, Africabetnow and many more.
 For the money remittance companies, we had Richard Branson’s Transferwise, Sendvalue from Switzerland. In e-commerce, we had DHgate in China. They are using us across 8 countries in Africa now.
 For tours and travel, we only have one  which is Trip Advisor and in the forex world, we have eToro, Ticknail, and a couple of other Forex brokerage companies.
 SDA: How about telecoms, do you have any?
 KN: The telecoms are not our clients. I would call them our enablers.
 SDA: What are the markets that contributed the biggest percentage of the amount?
 KN: The biggest was Kenya, followed by Nigeria. But now South Africa has started. So I am hoping it could surpass both of these combined. Ghana is also really relatively big, and then the rest follow suit.
 SDA: Are you looking at expanding to all 54 African countries?
 KN: At the moment, yes. Thats our priority. We are trying to synchronize Africa with the rest of the world. If you are trying to add Africa to the rest of the world, it means you have to get all the 54 countries. We started with East Africa, went to West and then the Southern part. So our priority now is a few countries in North Africa and then we will pick it up from there.
 SDA: Youre talking about expansion but you cant do that without funds. How are you financing this expansion?
 KN: Currently, we have two investors that I prefer not to disclose. They have given us over £2.5 Million. So, that is giving us runway. But initially, it was all about the hard work. You try to get partners, make some money. After you have made some bit of money, you use that same money to get into another country and then get into the next. But after some time, it begins to make sense.
 SDA: Talking about employment, how many people are you employing currently?
 KN: Currently, the total is about 120. But we are trying to get that down because of the more automation we are doing. [The number high] because whatever new country we get in, we need to get some people to work there. To deal with legal and compliance issues.
 Ideally, we dont need so many but it is because of the fragmentation of the African continent. Thats why we are ending up with so many people.
 SDA: What are you looking at in 2018, especially the Nigerian market that you entered last year?
 KN: The first target we had set ourselves was to see if we had that capability of processing at least a million pound a month [in Nigeria]. Luckily, we already surpassed that. We are doing almost 4-5x that. So, in the next few months, I believe the Nigerian market will be one of our largest markets.
 Honestly, what I like about the Nigerian market is that people are more aware of what is happening. People are more willing to pay. We are not yet properly operational there but the moment we stabilize we shall give Flutterwave a run for their money in their own country.
 SDA: Any last words?
 KN: At the moment, we are building not a payment gateway but a utility. We are envisioning the African economy as a single playing field. The same way anyone can pay using their card in the western world, that hasnt been possible in Africa yet because of so many mobile money wallets. It has so much fragmentation. Our goal is to synchronize all those.

 Though, GALI, Global Accelerator Learning Initiative, released a report [PDF] this February. Some of its findings raise questions on the selection criteria. According to the report, “accepted and rejected ventures reported fairly similar track-records (except that accepted ventures were significantly more likely to report philanthropy).”
 This implies two things; Either there’s a need for more accelerators to accommodate the growing number of ventures, or the quality of ventures is not good enough. Hence programs settle with those with a more social impact appeal.
 This could be because most accelerator programs in the region have a backing of impact-focused investors. GrowthAfrica has Ford Foundation, Argidius, Hivos and ANDE as some of its partners.
 But, GrowthAfrica says that “the objective of the programme is to scale ventures, make them investment ready and to develop entrepreneurial leadership”.
 Founded in 2002, GrowthAfrica is fast turning into one of the most sought-after post-revenue programs in the East African region.
 
 “Since 2012, GrowthAfrica has graduated more than 280 entrepreneurs, from 12 acceleration programmes, enabling them to scale their impact and increase their revenue across and beyond Africa,” said Patricia Jumi, the Managing Director and Co-Founder of GrowthAfrica.
 
 “Post revenue businesses are exciting for us to work with as they are the engine of growth in Africa,” added Johnni Kjelsgaard, Founder and CEO, GrowthAfrica. “We work very closely with them to identify gaps that are preventing them from growing at the scale that they should.”
 On its website, GrowthAfrica lists Uganda’s RoundBob, ClinicMaster and Intel World [Xente.co] as some of its notable alumni from Uganda.
 This year, it the following companies from Uganda will join the program; Jumpstart Africa, Superchillo, Fundibots, Kijani, KweNu, Krystal Ice, Agrodynamics, Rabboni and Krinis. While the following will join from Kenya; Hoji, Peperuka, KopaCent, Mainstream Bookshop, Bluewave, Urban Coffee, I Like Local, Vivid Gold, Gambino and FreshBox
 
 “We are excited to welcome the 36 ventures, and as we start the 2018 acceleration programmes, we shall work with these ventures to address gaps, doubling their revenues and tripling their profits,” Johnni said.
 
 The program attracts an average of 12 companies per cohort per country. So far, GrowthAfrica boasts over 25,000 jobs created by its portfolio companies.
 Cherubet Foods, one of the portfolio companies was “able to develop and are currently implementing a sales strategy to grow sales by 300%.” While as Keyara “[improved] their product focus as a result.”
 The GALI report points out that most companies in sub-Saharan Africa apply to accelerator programs for funding.
 “Over 25% of ventures rank direct funding as the most important, followed by network and skill-building,” the report says. At 27%, direct funding ranks higher for African entrepreneurs compared to a global 22%. “Compared to the global sample, African entrepreneurs are more interested in gaining direct funding and business skills,” the report adds.
 And to date, “startups that have participated in GrowthAfrica’s programmes have raised more than $44million in investments, loans and grants.”

"Why are African startups launching in multiple countries before they even hit seed stage funding?
","Most investors in the US or Europe would think it was crazy if their pre-seed or even seed stage company was planning an international launch. The advice would likely be: stay focused, prove product-market fit first then think about international expansion at your Series B round.
 For financial companies with the extra burden of regulation and licensing in new jurisdictions it is even more daunting to consider international expansion than it would be for, say, e-commerce or other digital sectors.
 
 We think they (African startups) play by a different set of rules when it comes to finding “product market fit”.
 
 But this is exactly what we are seeing in the African markets. Many startups are launching in multiple countries and even crossing over oceans to launch on multiple continents before their Series Seed or Series A rounds. What is driving this trend? We at DFS Lab think it is because product-market fit has a different definition in the context of the many small economies that comprise Africa vs the definition in larger economies.
 First, let’s look at some data to show what we mean:
 Photo: DFS Lab
 We put together the above table looking at the biggest fintech startup investments in Africa in 2018. We were curious about geography and multinational expansion. A few trends stand out.
 First, the majority (7 out of 13) of the biggest deals in African fintech over the past year are series A or series Seed. The sector is growing fast and new companies vastly outnumber old ones — much like a country undergoing rapid population growth where most of the population is still very young.
 It’s an exciting time to be in fintech in Africa!
 A second interesting pattern; we see that most (4 out of 7) of these newer Series Seed/A stage companies had already expanded to multiple countries before their latest A/Seed round. The average for these companies is to be active in 3.1 countries by the time of their raise.
 
 Number of countries active: 23
 Average for all companies: 4.5
 Average for companies’ Series Seed and A: 3.1
 
 This phenomenon is puzzling. And it mirrors what we see in the DFS Lab portfolio. Many of the companies we support are considering international expansion from the very beginning. “Can you help us with introductions in Pakistan and Indonesia?” was the question from one of our Africa-based portfolio companies. At the time, they had managed to close only a handful of customers with a completely manual, spreadsheet-based product (they purposefully hadn’t even written any code!).
 So what is going on?
 There are a few hypothetical forces that could be driving this trend.
 Force # 1 — companies in Africa often go longer before raising institutional capital so may be further along by the time they get their Series Seed than companies in other geographies — i.e. they may have already demonstrated some form of product market fit and be focused on scaling before they get their first round of venture investment. We think this force has something to do with it but is not the main driver.
 Force # 2 — the basic economic imperative to find a large enough addressable market to justify venture investment is driving companies to expand internationally before they truly find product-market fit. *Most countries in Africa are too small of a market to be interesting on their own. For comparison to US-based landmarks: Kenya’s GDP is just bigger than Jacksonville FL and smaller than Louisville/Jefferson County. Even Nigeria — Africa’s largest economy — has a GDP only a bit smaller than Boston, MA. Very few startups in the US would attempt to raise venture money claiming they were only going to target a single mid-sized US city — they must target them all. And so it goes with African startups — they must target the broader continent and even beyond to find a big enough market to be interesting to international venture investors.
 
 *Kenya GDP 74.94 billion US dollars in 2017 — just bigger than Jacksonville FL at 71.4 billion and smaller than Louisville/Jefferson County at 74.95 billion US dollars in 2016 ; Nigeria GDP 375.77 billion US dollars in 2017 — just bigger than Atlanta, GA at 363.7 billion dollars and just smaller than Boston, MA at 422 billion US dollars in 2016
 
 Force #3 — one theory is that lower labour costs and greater similarity of regulations and customers across countries make its easier to go from one country to the next in Africa than it would be to launch in a second country outside the US. Even if this is partly true, there still appears to be a lot of complexity in launching in a new market with new regulations, languages, and incumbents to deal with. We don’t put a lot of stake in this theory.
 Is this trend positive? We hear this question often but we think its the wrong question to ask. To the extent the trend of launching in multiple countries is driven by the economic imperative of force # 2, it will be the reality many startups face. But what advice do we offer founders wrestling with the question of when to expand and how?
 Everyone will answer this question differently, but we have a few observations.
 First, we believe the right way to think about this issue is in the context of product market fit which (some investors would say) is the primary mission of a Series Seed/A stage company.
 Marc Andreessen is often credited with coining the term PMF (Product-Market Fit) in this post. He defines it as 1) being in a good market with 2) a product which can satisfy that market. People tend to focus on part 2) — whether the product sells or satisfies customers because that is what they can control. But being in a small market is often more damning because you can’t do anything about it. In the context of this post, it’s about proving whether you can satisfy customers in more than one market to prove you have both a good product and a large enough market.
 If I have a product that is loved and rapidly adopted by the 15% of Kenyans who have a smartphone but doesn’t work elsewhere due to different market conditions or consumer habits, I don’t really have product-market fit to a good (large enough) market.
 Also, read Silicon Valley: Invest in Africa, But Do It Differently
 Asking the PMF question in this way positions the international expansion question much earlier in the growth cycle of the company at the stage before product market fit rather than at the scale stage.
 As I said above, each founding team will answer this question differently and there probably is no right answer for all. On the list above we see Cellulant in 11 countries by the time of their recent Series C while M-Kopa is only in Kenya and Uganda with many more rounds and dollars raised under their belt. Paystack’s recent series A is a good example — though they were only in Nigeria as of the raise, the press release states the main purpose of the series A investment is to scale to other countries.
 At DFS Lab we focus on supporting our portfolio teams so they can make the best decisions for themselves and offer resources that help them in that journey.
 Examples of ways we try to help our founders with this choice include:
 
 We connect our portfolio with other successful founders who have pursued a multi-country strategy (e.g. connecting them with CEOs of some of the companies in the above table). Authentic advice from someone who has been there is sometimes the most helpful thing.
 We help teams set up learning trips and make intros to other markets. We’ve even gotten a few invited along on paid learning trips to China or Silicon Valley to get inspiration (e.g. with Pezesha who went on the Caribou Digital Live Learning trip to China)
 And we sometimes ask the natural question “Is it too soon to expand?” Rather than risk going off the rails trying to expand into multiple markets early — just tell the story of how that happens while focusing your real energy on getting things right in your home market.
 
 Whatever teams decide, they can’t lose sight of the need to always deliver a product that customers want and make sure they can do that reliably. For African teams, this may mean focusing on customers next door, or those across the continent and beyond.

"INTERVIEW: Anthony Natif on lessons he learnt from aggressive expansion, running out of money and finally raising around $3 Million
","Mid last year, Guardian Health Pharmacy raised capital through private equity funding. Although Anthony, the Managing Director made it clear that he wasnt at liberty to divulge the details, our sources revealed that it was in the region of $3 Million for a controlling stake.
 Prior to this investment, the fund  which preferred not to be mentioned  had approached Anthony Natif, the founder and Managing Director of the pharmaceutical chain in 2015. However, at that time, the business was running just fine and he didnt see the need for a partner.
 Founded in early 2013, Guardian Pharmacy, which aims to be “Your neighbourhood Pharmacy of Choice” embarked on a rapid expansion with the aim of having a pharmacy in all the upmarket suburbs of Kampala by the end of 2016. They, however, faced serious cash-flow problems stemming from their aggressive expansion.
 According to Anthony, this expansion wasn’t well thought through at that time and in there, he says, lies a lesson for entrepreneurs. Especially those looking to scale their businesses.
 After running out of cash flow, he was forced to go back and knock on the door of the very people he had turned away, previously. And, luckily enough, after six months of due diligence, he secured an investment from them.
 In this interview, Anthony details all the mistakes he made prior to the investment from a private equity fund, the lessons he learned and also has a message for entrepreneurs at the end.
 Startup Digest Africa: You previously turned down a funder, but again re-approached them. Tell me about that.
 Anthony Natif: I wish we had taken them on back in 2015. Because we would be very far. Theyve been fantastic. Theyve really helped me. In 2015, we were doing very good in terms of turnover. And, we were making good money. Well, at least we thought we were. So, we felt that from that money we could easily finance our growth.
 As a growing company, it is very easy to lose sight of your bottom line and instead put more emphasis on volume of sales. The amount of money you’re putting in the bank blinds you and you start thinking that all that money is your money. And then you pick that money and use it for expansion, thats what we did.
 In 2015 we were doing very well, the fund came in and we signed a letter of intent and didnt bother following up. Then 2016 we get on an expansion drive and things started going south then we are like oh, we need this investor.
 SDA: Was the cause the rigorous expansion?
 Anthony Natif: Yes! We probably had opened 11 stores in Kampala alone. We have had to temporarily put some on hold. Which is now where that technical expertise comes in from. And the financial discipline.
 SDA: Are you still in Kampala alone?
 Anthony Natif: We are in Jinja and also going to Mbarara. We already have a pharmacy in Jinja on Main street. Hopefully, we will get to the Eastern part of Uganda and the Northern. We want to be in 10 main districts.
 SDA: Is that by close of Next year?
 Anthony Natif: We havent yet put a clear timeline. But I think we shall have 35 stores in the next 2 years.
 SDA: How does it feel to know that youre waking up but the challenge is not the cash for expansion, rather how to expand?
 Anthony Natif: It is a relief. Because now you have a partner who has your back. When youre in a single founder company, you get tempted to think I make all the decisions, I have all the freedom. But, you can not have freedom when you have all the worry of all supplier debt. You have the worry of, I need to make the payroll, how do I make the payroll and then still expand?
 So, you know those challenges. You never sleep. There was a time I used to sleep for only 3 hours. Because youre constantly worried about your peoples next paycheck. You mortgage everything you have to make sure your dream comes to fruition. But then this partner comes on board and says well, I believe in you. I believe in what youre trying to build. Lets do this together. Its such a relief!
 SDA: How much did they bring on board?
 Anthony Natif: I am not at liberty to divulge that. But its significant, its really significant and they are willing to back us with insane amounts of money if it makes business sense and we think it does make business sense. But more than just making business sense, it helps the society in which we live, tremendously.
 SDA: Did you retain control or you lost it?
 Anthony Natif: You see, now, that control question is what stops a lot of people from considering say private equity or getting partners on board. Because theyre so obsessed with staying in control.
 But, what point is it for you to have all of something so small as opposed to having a bit of something really huge. Something thats going to reach millions of people. Which would you choose?
 I would rather lose control but see my dream come true. And still, economically, it makes more sense. If you own 10% of a $30 Million company, as opposed to having 100% of a $100,000 company. Which would you take?
 Control is overrated, help is what you need. Then you grow together. I hope your readers and budding entrepreneurs realize that control means owning all the stress. Spread it out. Let someone help you out with that load.
 SDA: Is it control that made you turn down the first offer they came with?
 Anthony Natif: Not really. I hadnt paid much attention to private equity, quite frankly. But then that first encounter with our partners got me curious. So I read about it a bit. The need for money, I didnt think it was there. And thats partly because I never paid attention to my bottom line. I was paying more attention to what we were putting in the bank.
 Back then; our expansion wasnt informed by clear financial analysis as it is these days with my partners onboard. You start thinking, if I am turning over x billion shillings, why would I need someone to give me more money? I already have enough money. So, I suppose part of my refusal wasn’t the loss of control per se but it was largely down to not properly having systems in place to help inform our decisions to expand.
 And, another part was fear of the unknown. You dont know whats going to happen. And, you just dont take it up. Which is a really stupid decision that I made. But at least, I can live to smile about it. Other people dont. Their companies dont survive that expansion.
 SDA: Have you interacted with people that refused to take this route and things go South?
 Anthony Natif: Yeah. Several. Of course, I am not at liberty to tell you. But there are some in the pharma area.
 I have friends who have turned this down and I think they are regretting. And it is sad because these are smart people, but growth is expensive. You cant just grow organically if you want to be at the cutting edge of innovation in any industry. You need some external funding. It is a natural thing; you want to have control of your company. You look at it like your baby.
 SDA: You recommend that one brings in an investor or partner when the curve is going up but it is hard to know when the curve is going to go down. So at what point do you tell that the curve is going down or about to?
 Anthony Natif: It is very hard to know when the curve is going down. And, I think your question is when do you know that it is the right time.
 SDA: Yes. Is there a time when it is too early when it is too late?
 Anthony Natif: Yeah. Because youre lost in there, and not looking at your business from an outsider’s perspective. So, you are the last person to realize that the business is going down. You need to have people you disagree with as part of the team.
 People who challenge your thinking. People who are pessimistic. As an entrepreneur, youre all adrenaline pumped. You have a goal you want to get to and youll do whatever it takes to reach that goal. Even ignore risks.
 So, you want people in there wholl point out these risks to you. Pay those people well and listen to them. Those same people will be advising you on the health of the business.
 SDA: So, these people youre talking about, are they employees, board members or just shareholders?
 Anthony Natif: All the above. But it is important to have a board. It keeps you the entrepreneur in check.
 SDA: Did you have one at that time?
 Anthony Natif: No, I was the last voice. And when you run the analysis of a lot of these companies that we think are doing really well, the SMEs that are growing very fast, youll find they dont have that corporate governance structure in place.
 They are relying on the founder to drive growth. To be the guy who approves numbers because part of the money that runs the company is coming from this guys pockets. So he feels he has a right to everything and every decision.
 When you have a board in place, benefits from that are immense. They keep you focused. But remember youre also part of the board. So you have a chance to push back. It is not that the board dictates what you do. It provides you with guidance. Invaluable guidance.
 SDA: But how important is the timing you talked about? Before the curve starts going down.
 Anthony Natif: Let me tell you something as an entrepreneur, timing is very important. If you make a decision to grow your company beyond just subsistence, you need to get the timing right.
 At what point do you bring an investor on board. Often times we wait until stuff is going awry in terms of our cash flows and then we panic and try to get an investor on board. Yet, what I have learnt is that the best time to get an investor on board is when your curve is looking up. It becomes much easier to sell your story.
 You get more funding and theres no need for a turnaround. You also get a better valuation of your business.
 So, if youre in a business like Pharma, like how we are, we think about footprint like whats your spread? Thatll factor into your valuation. But then ultimately, the main point of valuation is going to be how much you have in profitability.
 If you use a lot of your working capital to expand, that may be good but then it is eating up your profitability. Every time you open a new store youre going to take up to 6 months before you start seeing its promise to turn a profit.
 So then if you have spread out so thin, youve exhausted your working capital and youre not a consultant, youre in the business of selling products. Youre not gonna have products, so you wont have good numbers.
 But, you already have an asset, which is the footprint. Yet, when youre getting an investor onboard at that time, youre selling yourself short because the investor is getting the upside of your spread. But using your lack of profitability to drive down valuation. This, I’ve seen in many businesses.

 SDA: Talking about expansion, earlier on you talked about expansion that wasnt well thought out. How is it valuable that one stays focused?
 Anthony Natif: If you dont have the information that guides your expansion, you are running blind. If youre running blind, theres a chance youll finish a race without a problem. But theres also a chance youre gonna run into a stray boda-boda or a wall.
 So, at the base of every business should be data and information. Get as much as you can and make sure any decision that pertains to your business is informed by data.
 SDA: So, was there times when you were expanding by just waking up and feel like you can go to a new location?
 Anthony Natif: I was expanding by intuition. I wasnt running any numbers. Though there was a certain formula to our madness. We would look at these mobile money companies and ask for towns where they had the most mobile money transactions. We would go there. Because there, thats where we thought the most action was.
 Traditionally youd look at where there are most surrounding hospitals, homesteads and stuff like that. It was rudimentary but still, we had some information.
 SDA: Apart from the fact that you were running out of operating capital, is there any location that turned out to be a wrong target?
 Anthony Natif: No. All of our stores are in very good locations.
 SDA: So, was it just an issue of not paying attention to the bottom line?
 Anthony Natif: Yes. Youre expanding without paying attention to what youre going to use to fund that expansion.

 SDA: You talked about expanding to other districts in Uganda. Are there plans to expand outside Uganda?
 Anthony Natif: Of course, there are other plans that we may not be able to talk about now. But we want to own the East African market. We want to be your neighbourhood pharmacists, wherever you live. We want to do to pharma, what mobile money did to money.
 We want you to think about a drug and think about us. We want to give you a product thats cheaper and better quality in a timely and convenient manner, yet delivered professionally. There are no clear timelines for the expansion but thats the dream.
 SDA: Whats your upside in the market?
 Anthony Natif: We have a very broad, smart and experienced team running the company. These guys are exposed. We are able to go all out to find the best for our clients. We source medicine from all over the western world and are able to give a client a high-quality product, cheaper.
 And now we want to maintain that consistency. Build exclusivity around certain product lines, and give them to clients at prices that are mind-boggling. Our people are price sensitive.
 SDA: Did Centum ever approach you?
 Anthony Natif: No. But I have heard about Centum. Though they didnt approach me.
 SDA: Because they came for an event at The Innovation Village last year organized by BiD Network last year. Did you attend it?
 Anthony Natif: Yeah. Actually, BiD Network is the one that had got us money. Though what they got us wasnt enough. Actually, I think that companies should pay a lot of attention to BiD Network and accelerator programs like theirs. They do a fantastic job of preparing the entrepreneur for funding.
 They get you to understand your business better than you could. They help you understand the importance of having clear books and also put you out there. Allowing you to pitch to high net-worth individuals.
 But, the kind of money we were looking for to achieve the dream we had was bigger than we could raise from BiD Network. Though we learnt a whole lot of stuff from them and owe them a debt of gratitude for that.
 I would encourage businesses to go out there and approach organizations like BiD Network and engage them. It is going to prepare them for the process of looking for capital.
 SDA: Which kind of business do you recommend to go to BiD Network?
 Anthony Natif: I am looking at a business that has a turn over of at least 100 million shillings a year. It may look small but for the start it is good. Then youll learn things that will help you take your business to a whole other level.
 SDA: Do they run an accelerator or mainly networking?
 Anthony Natif: It is both. They have partnered with the Dutch embassy and it has these retired entrepreneurs, business leaders, big time players in several industries. I think they call themselves PUM experts. They take off time and come and donate it or help give technical expertise to budding entrepreneurs in Africa.
 So BiD Network has been able to create an ecosystem around this. Where you have these guys come in and entrepreneurs come in and marry the two. Say youre in the pharma industry and youre spending time with a guy who used to run a $2 Billion pharmaceutical company.
 Thats huge, and this guy is not in a hurry. He helps you understand your business and is the same guy wholl hook you up with funders. It is a good thing that BiD Network is doing. We need programs like that.
 SDA: Are they mainly into Angel Investment or bring in venture capital too?
 Anthony Natif: They mainly bring angel investors. They helped us raise $500,000 though it wasnt going to be enough for what we were going to do. So, we couldnt take the money.
 SDA: Why did you choose to go for Private Equity? Why didnt you give Venture Capital a chance?
 Anthony Natif: You want peace of mind. But again, someone shouldnt just bring money to your company. They should bring you more than just money. They should protect you from yourself. As entrepreneurs, we are driven by the need to grow. We run on adrenaline
 You need someone wholl check that growth. If someone just writes you a check and says, go and do what you said you were gonna do. You are going to blow that money. You need a partner wholl keep an eye on that.
 SDA: So, which other partners did you look at before deciding to settle for the one you got?
 Anthony Natif: My current partners are, quite frankly the best. I told you about the other fund [he preferred that we leave it out] out of Kenya that approached us, but we went with these guys because they offered the best combination of money, approachability and technical support.
 It is a really good fund and they have smart people who not only care about the growth of the business but also want to have a positive impact on the communities we serve. When you get a funder who cares about the society in which you operate, that cant be replaced with money.
 SDA: Which other investments have [the fund that invested in Guardian Pharmacy] they done here in Uganda?
 Anthony Natif: If you have been reading the papers, theyve invested in African queen, the distributors of BIC Pen, among other FMCGs. They have also invested in Chims, the mobile money giant.
 SDA: Earlier on you told me that you turned down one fund but accepted these guys. Why? Whos a good investor, according to you?
 Anthony Natif: Now, it has to feel right. Initially, when we talked to that other fund, it just didn’t feel right. They struck us as hardnosed capitalists who just cared about their bottom-line.
 Now, with the investor we finally ended up going with, we struck a balance. They spent time understanding us as individuals, where we wanted to be, how we wanted to get there and we found alignment. The valuation wasnt brutal. Though we probably would have gotten more, I cant really complain about that because I got the best of both worlds.
 And then these guys go beyond just getting you money. The question is; what are they gonna add to your business?
 The guys we have now are fantastic. They bring so much technical expertise. From the financial side, they organize your company.
 Now I look back and I am like what was I running before these guys came in? Things were just all over the place. Now you see certain order. If you want document X, theres document X. Of course, it is still a work in progress but theres a clear direction.
 So, if an investor is coming on board and just giving you money, I dont know but I think youll be getting the short end of the stick. You need someone with whom you align. Who brings more than just money and is going to drive you forward. Challenge you to be better as a person.
 Recently, I was giving a talk at Deloitte [Uganda] and there was this young man with a very good business he has been running for over 5 years. But, he is finding it hard to separate his money from the company money.
 It is a struggle we as founders face. We always treat our businesses as an extension of our lives. Weve put in our money, mortgaged whatever we have, the whole nine yards to ensure our businesses are successful  it is very hard to separate ourselves from our companies. But, when you get a good investor, theyll help you achieve that.
 SDA: Any last words?
 Anthony Natif: To grow [a busines], you need money. Dont think you wont need money to get there. But, in a country like Uganda where you have very low levels of employment, we need to have an understanding around the growth of companies so that these companies can grow beyond the founders.
 The question any entrepreneur should ask himself or herself is; how can I grow beyond subsistence and be able to employ more people? How do I own the market?
 We should spend a lot of time teaching entrepreneurs what to do to make a business investable. When you get to that level, we shall see less business failure rates in this region. Youll be shocked to learn that in 2015, 10% of adult Ugandans opened a business. But then 1/5 of those between 18 and 65 closed a business.
 We are the most entrepreneurial country in the world, but also, we have pretty much the highest business failure rate. Why? Because theres that gap in knowledge in how to run a business. How to grow businesses.
 We need to spend a lot of time teaching our people that. And then doing these networking events, connecting them to potential funders. Potential people wholl give them expertize. Doing mentorship programs from right down in secondary schools, which will produce the future business owners. Lets be purposeful about this.

"Uganda’s Outbox Hub partners with Kenya’s Moringa School
","Last week, Outbox Hub, one of the leading hubs in Uganda, announced a partnership with Kenya’s Moringa School. Together they are running a 5-week full-time introduction to programming course.
 “Outbox, in collaboration with Kenya based Moringa School  launched today the first in a series of coding boot camps focused on imparting industry relevant software engineering skills to young people,” part of the press release read.
 According to Outbox, this partnership stemmed from noticing a shortage of relevant software developers in the country.
 “It is through this work that Outbox noticed the severe shortage of industry relevant software development skills in the country not only for the startups in their community but also the various organizations both for-profit and nonprofit,” Outbox noted in the press release.
 Also read: Here’s why Ugandan hubs are coming together
 The initiative, dubbed Outbox EDU, will see Outbox offer Moringa School’s technology training course through a five-week full-time computer science fundamentals course known as “Moringa Prep,” in June 2018. Moringa Prep covers the foundational concepts of all high-level programming languages.
 Outbox expects to tap into Moringa’s experience in “developing and delivering industry-relevant technology education.”
 “With this partnership, our young people will be able to tap into world-class learning and employment opportunities, thus improving the quality of our offering to potential software engineers in Uganda,” said Richard Zulu, CEO at Outbox.
 “Our collaboration with Moringa School goes a long way in supporting our mission to grow inclusive communities that foster talent where we operate. We are very excited to be working with them in Uganda and tapping into a Pan-African network.”
 While Audrey Cheng, a Co-founder, and CEO of Moringa School said that “this partnership will ensure we continue to provide access to our quality education programs to more individuals in other parts of the continent.”
 Currently, there are various players plugged into the software and programming skills development industry across Africa. Though they don’t necessarily do the same thing, their roles and contribution more or less overlap each other. The most notable ones are Andela, MEST Africa, Moringa School.

"These are the winners and loser in the proposal to remove taxes on smartphones by NITA-U
","This week, on January 24, James Saaka the Executive Director, NITA-U   while appearing before the Committee on ICT to discuss the Budget Framework Paper FY 2018/19  proposed a removal of taxes on smartphones.
 According to New Vision [print, page 6] of January 25, 2018, Saaka told the committee headed by Annet Nyakecho (Tororo North County) that in a bid to increase accessibility of smartphones, NITA-U in conjunction with the ministry of ICT &amp; National Guidance have agreed to bring a proposal to Parliament to remove taxes on smartphones.
 While as NITA-U did explain that this accessibility to smartphones will lead to an increased usage of government e-services  which NITA-U has been working on tirelessly, I think this wont be the case. The immediate, medium and long-term beneficiaries in this are not NITA-U itself. For example, how many people with smartphones already visit those e-government platforms?
 Currently, there are various parties that the taxation on smartphones affects both directly and indirectly. These are; telecoms, phone dealers [both authorized and non-authorized], [smartphone] app developers, end users, Uganda Revenue Authority and others.
 In this writing, I provide a breakdown of who stands to gain and lose. Though, in the long-run, all stand to gain. Even NITA-U, though not directly in form of people using government e-services.
 THE WINNERS
 
 Telecommunication Companies
 
 It is no longer a secret that telecoms are now betting on deriving their biggest chunk of revenue in the coming years from data and digital products. And, consumption of internet data has spiralled in the past few years.
 For example, while reporting [PDF] in their 2015 performance report, MTN Uganda  the biggest telecom company in Uganda with an estimated 53% market share, indicated that it experienced a 17.4 percent increase in data revenue that contributed 28.3 percent of the revenue. Fast forward, to 2016, the telecom reported [PDF] that Data revenue alone rose by 29.2 percent to Shs. 77 billion from Shs. 60.8 billion in 2016.
 This was attributed to an increase in data traffic and good growth in data bundle adoption.
 Similarly, Airtel Uganda, the second largest telecom after MTN Uganda with an estimated 38% market share, reported that value-added services that include voice mail, phone back-up and postpaid bill payment, and data saw their revenue more than double from Shs169.6bn to Shs306.28bn [PDF] in the period of 2016.
 Clearly, it doesnt take rocket science to understand that the future revenue for the telecoms is internet data and digital services (which also depend on data). This, therefore, implies that telecoms need as many smartphones in peoples hands as possible.
 Because, as you already guessed, a person with a smartphone has more internet data needs compared to one with a basic feature phone which uses USSD. But, out of 25 Million mobile phone subscribers, you have only four million with smartphones, according to Saaka.
 Therefore, with the rise of messaging and social platforms, the biggest winners in this proposed tax removal on smartphones are the telecoms. Because of the direct positive correlation between internet usage and a smartphone.
 2. App Developers
 There was a debate on whether reducing taxes on smartphones will actually drive an uptake in the usage of local applications. Barbara Birungi, a co-founder of Hive Colab and Witu called it super good news for the developers. Adding that if you are a startup that built an app for [a] smartphone, it’s looking brighter because more users will come on board soon.
 Well, some people like Stephen Ssenkomago  a member of ICTAU, defer in opinion. Stating that the challenge [for local apps] is not smartphones but [the] utility of the apps. He argues that the affordability of smartphones has not been a blocker for [the] adoption of apps in the country.
 Though theres no direct correlation between smartphone affordability and adoption of local applications, my argument is that it is a significant factor in its own right. Just like affordability of internet data bundles is.
 Reaching full-scale adoption of local apps will require a lot of factors to align, and affordability of smartphones is one of them. Otherwise, do you expect those to use your application to run it on a Nokia 105?
 So, definitely, App developers are beneficiaries of this. But, as Stephen argues, it is only those whose apps will solve a real need that will benefit.
 3. Energy Companies
 According to this report from GSMA, In 2015, Fenix International partnered with MTN Uganda, to provide ‘free’ smartphones to individuals who purchased the solar company’s power systems.
 Similarly, M-Kopa has a smartphone partnership with Safaricom. The report indicates that the solar energy company began offering smartphone loans in 2016 for consumers who had completed their payment plans on their solar home systems.
 Keep in mind that these energy companies are targeting people who are at the bottom of the pyramid  who others prefer to call the cant afford to spend a dollar a day or as the report called them, rural poor and rural working poor.
 To this group that these companies are targeting, even a five dollar change in the prices is significant. This is a price-sensitive group. Now, imagine scrapping VAT and Excise duty on imported phones which are 18% and around 10% respectively.
 Fenix International has been able to grow from 100,000 subscribers at the start of 2017 to over 150,000 by close of 2017 in Uganda, according to sources I spoke to. Similarly, M-Kopa has been able to reach over 300,000 homes in East Africa as of mid-2017.
 All these people they are reaching, as pointed out up there, are bottom of the pyramid. Imagine if the smartphones were more affordable? So, yes, clean energy companies stand to gain. A lot.
 3. Authorized Distributors
 According to the same GSMA report referenced above, in 2016, Kilimall Uganda partnered with a global smartphone manufacturer Infinix Mobility, to launch the Infinix Note 3 for (~$148) and Hot 4 (~$115) in the Ugandan market.
 The report also adds that Tecno Mobile has established a franchise retail network that has been successful in providing low-cost smartphones across Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria, Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda &amp; Ethiopia since 2010.
 Though, the biggest competitor to these authorized or licenced distributors is Mutaasa Kafeero, OLX, Jumia Deals, Liquidation Uganda and your friend who wants to dispose of their old phone. As it is currently, theres a huge price difference between a new phone and a second hand  which is even less than a year old  of the same model and brand.
 Removing the taxes wont match the prices but would reduce the price difference significantly. This will allow one to have a luxury of comparing the two.
 So, authorized distributors, too, stand to gain from this. Given that most people that buy second hand phones do that solely based on the price. And, in the end, Transsion Holdings, the parent company of the Tecno and Infinix brands will be smiling.
 4. End-users
 Definitely, the first beneficially are the end-users. The people that want to buy the phones. A reduction in the new phone prices will automatically imply a reduction in the prices of the used phones. Say, if one can access a brand new phone at UGx. 100,000 (roughly USD 30), then you have to have a very lowly priced used phone to entice them.
 5. Facebook and Co.
 Saaka, in his interview with New Vision, said that they want to remove taxes on smartphones so that they are affordable. He added that we want a common man in Nakapiripirit to afford a smartphone and process his driving permit and passport without necessarily coming to government offices in Kampala.
 
 Also read: BICU should transform Up Accelerate into the standard accelerator to build sustainable startups in Uganda
 
 Which is actually good. Sad news? Thats not what will happen. The people wholl be able to purchase the affordable smartphones are going to do something very different from what Saaka thinks. Theyll rush to catch up with their peers on WhatsApp and Facebook.
 Because, what are the chances that a person in Nakapiripirit knows about NITA-U and its e-government services? Zero. But, what are the chances that they heard someone on their local radio station say like us on facebook or send us a WhatsApp message? 100%.
 So, Mark Zuckerbergs Facebook and co. are in business.
 LOSERS
 
 Uganda Revenue Authority
 
 Uganda Revenue authority is the loser in this game. Though, thats in the short term. Currently, I dont have the exact figure of how much URA earns from taxes on smartphones and therefore cant state whether removing it will deal a significant blow or not.
 But, based on this article (written in 2009), it must be significant. Of course, it involves both direct (VAT and Excise duty) and indirect taxes like a service fee, that they charge you on top of the airtime you buy.
 In that article, Keith Muhakanizi, the then under-secretary in the Ministry of Finance, said: “If there are no taxes on people using mobile phones, whom do we tax then? Can we have a government without taxes?”
 It also adds that Uganda Revenue Authority, the statutory body collecting taxes, reported its net tax collections from telecommunications companies last year [2008] amounted to US$3.57 billion or 9.5 percent of the country’s total tax revenue.
 Keep in mind that at that time, Uganda had an approximate 10 million subscribers  on Mobile, not fixed line connections. Now, go ahead and factor in the fact that the country now has over 25 million mobile phone subscribers.
 Yet at the time when the industry was bringing in 9.5%, people mostly used their mobile phones for voice calls. That has changed since then. Mobile phones are now doing everything.
 As of now, of the 25 million mobile phone subscribers, only four million Ugandans have smartphones. Yet, that four million is able to contribute a significant chunk of revenue to telecom companies. What if it doubled or tripled? What would be the effect on their revenue, and eventually taxes?
 While as this move of forfeiting revenue in form of VAT and Excise duty is not logical in the short run, it will surely pay off in the long run.
 Because, how easy is it for URA to tax a grandma in Bududa who has her money stashed in her pot? Yet, if that grandma subscribed to a social bundle to chat with her son in Kampala using WhatsApp voice notes, then URA can be able to get in the way via telecoms.
 Similarly, when you look at companies like Fenix International and M-Kopa vs. the grandma. Who is easier to tax? The grandma with her UGx. 5,000 stashed away or this company that can get the grandma to spend it?
 It is hard to detail all the benefits of this, but this report [PDF] can help paint a rough understanding of what they can be in the long run. But, one clear benefit is an increased tax base.
 In conclusion, I would like to state that the above was based on the assumption that the removal of the taxes eventually leads to a significant increase in the number of new smartphones bought and used. Otherwise, we may struggle to see a benefit for any of the identified parties in case it doesnt turn out to be so.

"Uganda&#8217;s Masikini Aiming at Dominating East Africa
","&nbsp;
 Masikini is an e-commerce platform whose aim is to make shopping less painful for Ugandans. It started serious operations in January 2017 though was operating prior to that. Currently, they have one store which is located at Oasis Mall basement. 
 At the start of this week, I had a quick chat with Enock Lubwama, who heads the operations at the store. Enock was able to run me through their day to day processes, current, and future plans.
 How it works
 So, basically, Masikini is that guy who is willing to go out and buy things for you because theyre more familiar with the process they have done over time. They dont own any stock.
 They dont own any stock. Instead, they curate products from some of the worlds best e-Commerce sites as well as other stores they partner with.
 Enock highlighted Amazon and eBay as their biggest sites for Uk and the US. And when it comes to China, they have been able to establish connections with various stores on the ground.
 However, in case one wants to buy a product from a different site thats not listed on Masikini, then they can just email Masikini the link to the product.
 One challenges that Masikini spotted here and took was the lack of a clear and established address system in the country. So what do they do? They set up a permanent address in the US, UK, and China. All the
 All the products their customers buy from those countries are shipped to their addresses in the respective countries, then to their address in Uganda  eventually  from where you go and pick up your package.
 Also read: What You Should Know Before Launching an E-Commerce Platform in Uganda (from the MD Jumia Food)
 Starting 
 When I asked Enock about their numbers, he said they were really small when they were starting out. To me, this is not a surprise. He says this is partly due to the fact that Ugandans are not yet familiar with the fact that you could purchase anything online and have it delivered.
 However, as of now, they now get more than 20 orders a day. Theres also been a shift of order pattern. When they were starting out, most of the orders were coming from China. Yet now the pattern seems to be changing and most of the orders are coming from the US.
 Team and Expansion plans
 Masikini started with a team of eight and are still the same number. Though Enock projects that since they have expansion plans as well as experiencing a growth in a number of orders placed per day, that number might end up growing dramatically in the near future. theyll consider covering the entire East African
 Asked about their expansion plans, he said that theyre only considering expanding to other countries. However, this will come after hitting certain targets in the Ugandan market. They have the current target put at 1000 orders per day, something Enock believes can be achieved in the coming two years.
 Delivery
 Masikini hasnt started delivering yet. Whoever places an order has to go and pick it up from there, only, for now, store. However, as Enock said, they make special arrangements for those thatd like to have their packages delivered to them.Though, as you probably guessed, this comes at an extra fee covering the transportation.
 Model
 I wanted to understand if there are any plans to create a high breed model of marketplace and mall. What means is that Masikini would have a store of their own inventory as well as inventory from other sites like Amazon and eBay plus other stores listed on theirs.
 So, a customer would either purchase from Masikinis inventory or the listed sites.shall maintain our model and not open up a mall because it is so hard to predict what people want. Because
 Enock said they have not given it a thought and are looking to maintain their model for the foreseeable future. This he attributes to the fact that it is hard to predict what people really want. Because every day we get surprised orders.
 The waiting Lounge
 Status
 Currently, the products that move fast are clothing, shoes and hair pieces. And, not to my surprise, most of their clientele are women. In his estimate, Enock put it at 70% women and 30% men.
 He also stressed the fact the for every product that we try to advertise, if it is a ladies product, the responses are much quicker as compared to that for men. Masikini We are dealing in everything except automobile products.
 Masikini is currently able to deliver anything to you except automobile products. Though they have never handled any B2B deliveries. But Enock believes if one entrusted them with their order, they can deliver under a special arrangement.
 Serving Desks
 Monetization and Customer Acquisition
 Masikini makes its money by charging a commission of the shipping fees. Every shipment that they make is subjected to a commission. When
 When I asked for any estimates of shipping fees if I am looking for a pair of sneakers, he said this varies depending on the weight and dimensions of the package. The shipping cost varies according to the dimensions, weight, and price of the product.
 &nbsp;
 Currently, they are mainly using social media, to be specific Facebook and Instagram, to acquire new customers. Though theyre are considering going into print media.
 However, Masikini is not the first and only one to address this gap. Theres moe than six other platforms. These include GoodsExpress, Intership and others.
 The whole idea of e-commerce is not new to the world, even Uganda. But, we can not deny the fact that whoever tried out the idea in Uganda a few years ago faced a good amount of obstacles. From customer trust issues to low numbers of internet users as well as unnecessarily long delivery days to unfavorable payment means.
 These have not been completely tackled but, at least, we can all agree that the landscape is not as it was 5 years ago. We have all witnessed a tremendous shift in the number of internet users as well as a growing number of people shopping online.
 Compared to 5 years ago, the number of internet users in Uganda has jumped by almost 4 times the number in 2012 from around 3.5 Million to around 13 Million. So clearly, a person that played in this field 5 years ago faced a tougher challenge compared to the one playing in it now.

"African startups are stronger together: What we learned hosting our first cross-continental African program
","
 
 
 The Village Capital Africa team just just wrapped up our seventh investment-readiness program for early stage ventures in sub-Saharan Africa: FinTech Africa 2017, in partnership with the MasterCard Foundation and the DOEN Foundation.
 Over the course of three workshops, we worked with eight fintech startups from East and West Africa working to improve financial health in their markets, and are investing in the two peer-selected companies: Piggybank.ng and Olivine Technology.
 We did a few things differently this time around:
 
 We sourced applications from across sub-Saharan Africa to implement a cross-continental program. The objective was to expose Fintech entrepreneurs to their peers across Africa.
 We hosted the program in three different African hubs — Accra, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Lagos, Nigeria. The objective was to provide entrepreneurs the opportunity to work with investors, potential partners, customers and other stakeholders in new markets.
 We invited representatives from innovation hubs in francophone Africa to join each workshop as mentors. The objective was to foster learning and growth of entrepreneur support in that region.
 
 Here’s what we learned.
 1. Exposure to new markets is important — the earlier, the better
 The typical venture capital investor defines “scale” as a potential $1B market, which means that (with a few exceptions) for venture businesses in Africa to scale, they will have to venture beyond their own borders to other African markets.
 One concern we had about running a program in three different countries was that even if exposure to other markets is essential, we were providing this exposure too early in the game for our seed-stage ventures to be relevant. What we learned was quite the opposite: ventures that have scale potential should start planning for it now, even if they won’t (and shouldn’t) take action until achieving several other milestones first.
 We also realized that early exposure to mentors from Francophone Africa can help bridge the divide between English speaking and French speaking Africa. Throughout the program, we had the pleasure of hosting Laissa Mouen, the head of an entrepreneur support program through Cofina Groupe in Senegal. Due to her incredible guidance and insights, an entrepreneur from Nigeria actually changed her expansion plans to include Francophone Africa, a region she hadn’t previously considered. When we as entrepreneur support organizations make an effort to work together more, and share best practices, we strengthen the bridge between these markets.
 2. Investors in East and West Africa are very different
 Our team is very familiar with the VC space in Nairobi. Nairobi has a lot of impact investors, foreign investors, and foreign aid that is increasingly directed towards impact startups. However, we had the opportunity to move westward and learn about a new market: Lagos. And, it couldn’t have been a better choice.
 I was excited to see that Lagos has a number of active investors, which include Nigerian investors, as well as more and more Silicon Valley funds or offshoot funds hunting for deals, which we don’t see as much in Nairobi.
 Thanks to the help we received from the Africa Business Angels Network and the Lagos Angels Network, 24 investors participated in our final investor forum, and they meant business. For the first time at a Village Capital program in Africa, an investor actually offered one of the entrepreneurs terms on the spot at our event (versus after or many months later)!
 3. Entrepreneurs don’t just need investors, they need each other
 At Village Capital, we invest in using a model called peer selection: we ask entrepreneurs to evaluate each other’s businesses. Through this process, the entrepreneurs provide each other feedback and constructive advice on ways to improve their businesses.
 During this program, I continued to reflect on a recurring theme I’ve seen since beginning to work at Village Capital: the value of peer support. The value the entrepreneurs provide to one another is often the greatest takeaway from Village Capital programs. Because of the collaborative, community-oriented nature of the peer-selection model, entrepreneurs are provided a unique environment to meet like-minded innovators, and learn from each other.
 Curating a cohort of high-potential, non-competitive entrepreneurs in the same sector is a recipe for partnership. Every Village Capital program I have run has resulted in one or more official partnerships after the program, and at the very least — long-lasting support networks.
 Entrepreneurship is a lonely road, and support networks offer tangible benefits. Bernie Akpiriaye, founder of Matontine, highlighted that being part of the cohort was the best part of the process.

"AIIM invests $31M into BBOXX for a minority stake in its E. Africa business
","BBOXX, a London headquartered solar company has raised $31 million in Private Equity from Africa Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM), which invested through its AIIF3 fund.
 In return, the Private Equity investor will get a minority stake in BBOXXs operations in Rwanda, Kenya and DRC. According to BBOXX, this will allow them to install two million solar systems by 2022, bringing electricity to 10 million people in these African countries.
 
 This investment will accelerate the roll-out of BBOXX’s solar systems which combine solar panels and batteries with pioneering technology, available on a pay-as-you-go basis via mobile money.
 
 This AIIM investment is the latest in a string of deals that have seen BBOXX forge strategic partnerships across the industry, working with leading global electricity company EDF in Togo, world-leading telecommunications firm Orange in West Africa, as well as technological partners, investment institutions and local governments, to expand energy access at scale.
 Last year, the company raised funding to the tune of $5.1 million through equity crowdfunding ($1.15M) and Debt Financing ($4M). The loan came from Togo-based bank Union Togolaise de Banque (UTB), and BBOXX used it to expand its products across the African country.
 BBOXX says that it has so far brought electricity to 750,000 people in frontier markets, with substantial operations in countries including Rwanda, Kenya, Togo, the DRC, Nigeria and Pakistan.
 
 The funds will be applied across BBOXX’s distribution mix, positively impacting a range of customers including households, schools and SMEs across rural, urban and peri-urban regions. It will help in enabling economic growth in these communities by creating new markets through the entry point of electricity.
 
 Founded in 2010 by Mansoor Hamayun, the company also won this years Zayed Sustainability Prize in the Energy category which comes with a $600,000 prize. This latest round of funding, therefore, brings the companys total of funding raised  debt &amp; awards included  to more than $100 million.
 AIIM is a member of Old Mutual Alternative Investments with $2.1 billion in assets under management across the power, telecommunications and transport sectors and also has operations in 15 countries across East, West and Southern Africa. They have been investing in the African infrastructure sector since 2000 with a track record extending across seven African infrastructure funds.

","The Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme is the flagship entrepreneurship programme of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, founded by the entrepreneur, respected investor, and philanthropist Tony O. Elumelu.
 In March 2017, the Tony Elumelu Foundation announced the selected 1,000 Tony Elumelu entrepreneurs for 2017. Out of which, 74 were Ugandans  representing 7.4% of the selected candidates. Making it the country with the highest representation after Nigeria  509.
 Out of the entrepreneurs that represented Uganda in Lagos this year was Julius Muwonge, the founder of a Ugandan startup YoHomu  an online supermarket. He walked us through about what being a Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneur Program fellow.
 Startup Digest Africa: What does being a part of the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program mean to you? And what does it mean for your startup?
 Julius Muwonge: The Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship program is a pan African platform with the biggest network of entrepreneurs on the Continent. This gives me the opportunity to learn from others across the Continent. Secondly, as YoHomu its an opportunity to benchmark on similar business models across the continent.
 What is your biggest takeaway from the conference?
 Interacting with fellow entrepreneurs on the Continent that go through the same challenges I encounter every day and so resilient to make their business success. This gave me hope and rejuvenated my spirit of perseverance.
 Julius Muwonge with Vir Parminder CEO, Tony Elumelu Foundation
 Why should a startup founder in Uganda apply for the program?
 The 12-week online course is worth giving a shot, given it simplifies all the global business jargons. As a business head, it exposes you to the 360 sphere of business; marketing, sales, finance, and innovation.

 What do you think the program can do to serve the entrepreneurs better?
 A lot of it improvement is needed on the mentorship. Many mentors didnt come through.
 What are you planning to use the $5,000?
 Expanding on our delivery structure.
 Having interacted with fellow African Startup founders and entrepreneurs from other countries at the conference, what are they doing differently?
 A few I interacted with are building continental businesses. We should think similar for the sustainability and scalability of our businesses. Kampala is a small market for all of us.
 Having attended several fellowships and accelerators programs, what is different and unique about the Tony Elumelu Foundation?
 This is my second fellowship to attend, havent yet participated in any accelerator program as yet. However, the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship programme vision of Africapitalism (African solutions from native entrepreneurs) makes the entire program outstanding.

"After Expanding To Kenya, Egypt&#8217;s Swvl Is Now Headed To Uganda
","Towards the end of 2018, Mustafa Kandil, co-founder and CEO of Swvl, told Almal News some of their expansion plans. He pointed out that they were looking to expand to “10 cities outside Egypt in 2019, beginning with the Philippine capital of Manila and including Nairobi, Dakar, and Jakarta”.
 Early last month, we found out that the startup  which operates a bus-sharing service, was finalising expansion plans to Kenya. This conclusion was based on the adverts that Swvl was running on its Facebook page targeting Nairobi residents.
 Less than a month, the startup is headed to Uganda according to an email that Digest Africa received. The email contains details of a General Manager job position that Swvl is looking to fill. Per the job description, the person who will fill the role will lead the startups expansion plans into the East African country.
 After the huge success of its first market, Egypt, SWVL is seeking an entrepreneurial, experienced leader to take charge of the expansion of its innovative transportation system in Uganda, read some of the details.
 
 As Uganda General Manager, you will be responsible for the development and growth of SWVL’s business in Kampala and Uganda as a whole. You will be leading efforts to roll out SWVL’s new, innovative transportation system.
 
 According to a 2017 World Bank report [PDF] titled The Role of City Governments in Economic Development of Greater Kampala, it is estimated that 24,000 man hours a day are lost by commuters due to traffic jams.
 In the past decade, the Ugandan government has always had plans to curb the escalating traffic jam by phasing out taxis (matatus). It had planned to substitute them with alternatives such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) or rapid rail systems. However, none of that has come to fruition or execution  yet.
 The report cited above from the World Bank expressed the urgency that is needed to bring to order the traffic flow in Ugandas capital. The current transport system and regulatory environment needs to be further strengthened, it pointed out.
 Also read: Egypt’s street food vendor Zooba Eats raises $4M for US expansion
 A complete and sudden phasing out of taxis will not be feasible in the short run. As KCCA (Kampala Capital City Authority) has taken over more control of the taxi industry’s regulation since 2015, this provides an opportunity to regulate better and coordinating taxi (matatu) routes and stops, hopefully leading to less congestion and better traffic management.
 Despite the urgency of the situation, theres been little or no intervention from the government. For example, with the boda-boda industry, SafeBoda  a private player  is the one that instead brought order to the widespread chaos. It is, therefore, highly likely that it will take a private player like Swvl to bring order to Ugandas public transport system.
 Founded in April 2017  with over $38 million in venture capital raised  Swvl started to ensure that the roads were maximumly used; It started with an observation turning into a realization, the startup notes, too many cars on the streets, wasting our limited resources: time, space and money.
 The total number of cities that Swvl is operating in currently is not precise. Though, the expansion to Uganda  Kampala in particular  would bring the startups number of cities across Africa to at least four  Cairo, Alexandria, Kampala and Nairobi.
 Swvl is among the pioneers of the bus-sharing service across the globe, yet it has come under competition in recent times in the different regions where it operates. Among its main competitors in the Middle East and North Africa region include its former backer  Careem as well as Uber which launched its bus-sharing service in Cairo last year.
 In East Africa, Swvl will face competition from Safaricom-backed Little which also debuted its bus-sharing service in Nairobi at the beginning of February 2019 while Uber has also expressed interest in launching a bus/matatu sharing service in Kenya.
 What is interesting is that both Uber and Little  unlike Swvl  already have their ride-sharing services in Uganda. Therefore, it wont take them long to add bus-sharing on top of their current offering. What we have learnt over time is that merely adding service on top of the existing is not enough to win that particular vertical.
 An example of SafeBoda can be cited: although both Uber and Taxify added boda-hailing services on top of their then current offering, they have largely failed to outcompete the SafeBoda whose only focus is on the boda vertical (for now).

"Ringier&#8217;s Pulse looking to set up a Ugandan team
","Pulse Africa, one of Ringiers portfolio companies, is looking to set up a team in Uganda for its Pulse UG. This is according to Leonard Stiegelers LinkedIn post looking for the best UPCOMING digital, video and social EDITORS / BLOGGERS and CONTENT PRODUCERS.
 Leonard is the current General Manager of Ringier Africa AG. He has spent this entire week in Uganda meeting and interviewing various prospects. It is not clear whether they will hire a team, invest in an existing media company or acquire one of the blogs in Uganda.
 
 Though, based on what happened between Ringier and Ghafla, an acquisition wouldnt be an option to be considered.
 My conversation with Leonard also indicated that he was more inclined to hire an editor to manage the Ugandan office. Though, theres also a chance that they might be interested in an acquisition of a lifestyle and entertainment blog. Big Eye, by Ian Ortega, would potentially be the one to target.
 According to the Ringier Africa AG CrunchBase profile, they have so far made six acquisitions. These include Nigerias DealDey, Jobberman and Cheki and Kenyas BrighterMonday and BuyRentKenya as well as One Africa Media Group. All these were e-Commerce acquisitions, none in media.
 So, in case they do make one, it would be their first given their first attempt with Kenyas Ghafla wasnt unsuccessful and led to them launching Pulse Live Kenya.
 Ringier presents itself as the modern media group with an integrated and diversified value creation chain. The companys current strategy is based not only on media but also on e-commerce and entertainment.

 Previously, SafeBoda has only been running the android version to which it has made numerous updates since December 2016, when they made a complete overhaul, up to July this year  when they implemented the credit option allowing SafeBoda users avoid carrying cash.
 Though there is still a lack of exact figures on the smartphone operating system usage in Uganda, it is clear by a mere observation of smartphone users close to you that Android is still king. Therefore, SafeBoda made a good bet on going with Android first.
 However, despite the fact that iPhone (or iOS) users are still few not only Uganda but Africa, theyre still a good bet. This is because many are likely to be in middle-income hence a good disposable income to afford a decent ride.
 
 iPhone or Apple products are generally used as a symbol of status, going by online social status. One such example is the iPhone show off party being organized at Trendz Lounge in Bugolobi.
 With 10,000 downloads for its Android app in less than 24 months, thats not a bad figure compared to other locally developed apps.

"In Brief: Uber might consider launching a matatu option in Nairobi
","Uber may roll out a new service in Kenya to help users book seats on minibuses that ply the streets of the congested capital. That is if tests on the product in Egypt and Mexico prove successful, a company executive said on Wednesday.
 Uber estimates that more than a third of Kenyans in Nairobi use the often crowded minibuses, known as matatus, as their main form of transport around the city, Uber’s East Africa General Manager Loic Amado told Reuters.
 “We want to be part of the transportation ecosystem in Nairobi and matatus are a big part of how people move around,” he said, adding the feature would be available on the Uber app.
 Once the service is proven in Nairobi, Amado said it could be expanded to Kenya’s neighbours, such as Uganda’s capital Kampala and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. The idea would be to apply it to vehicles carrying up to 16 people, he added.
 Amado said the new Uber product would allow customers to track and trace the minibuses.

"Simba Food joins Jumia Food, Yum Deliveries in Uganda&#8217;s food delivery business
","On the 15th of December 2017, Industrial Area located Software World Uganda launched its food delivery service called Simba Food. This implies the company joins Lumumba Avenue located Jumia Food and Bugolobi based Yum Deliveries, who are both in the arena already. 
 Simba Food is a food delivery company. We deliver food to the customers doorstep in and around Kampala. Basically, we have an app on Google Play and App Store from where you can find the restaurants. We have more than 100 restaurants on board, said Purnendu Mukherjee, the CEO of Simba Food.
 Just like the other two, Simba Food allows one to order food from over an estimated 94 restaurants [my own count] on its platform. Beyond that, it also allows one to book a table at a restaurant as well as view events. The startup also says that they “use Thermal Box in every delivery bike to keep the food as warm as you eat from restaurant [sic]”.
 The model, according to Purnendu, is simple, you order for the food at the same price as it is a restaurant. All you have to pay for is the transport. This is the same model used by Jumia Food, and perhaps the majority of food delivery companies.
 The company, therefore, makes its money by negotiating a commission with the restaurant. Except for cases where a restaurant wants to stand out and they pay for advertising/boosting.
 Now, heres where it gets interesting from. With three players fighting to have restaurants on board, restaurant owners and users will benefit the most.
 Because this will take away the monopoly that Jumia Food has on the market. Which, according to the supply and demand law, dictates that restaurants will be in a position where they can negotiate fairer commission rates. 
 Yet, this is only possible if two assumptions hold true; If Jumia Food currently has a significant share of the restaurants revenue and if Simba Food and Yum Deliveries work on taking away a significant share of that.
 Jumia Food currently has over 150 restaurants on board, Simba Food has around 94 and Yum Deliveries [from a call I made to the customer service] has slightly above 40. 
 Currently, Jumia Food averages over 500 orders a day while Simba Food, according to Purnendu has an average of 25-40 orders per day. Though our sources indicate the figure could be below 25. For Yum Deliveries, I am not sure.
 Though, even Purnendu admitted that Jumia Food is definitely a bigger competition to Simba Food because they have been in this business for the last 3 to 4 years.
 
 They have already established their network and everything. So, definitely, we still have a long way to go. But, as Simba Food, we are definitely ready to push it.
 
 Additionally, Simba Food offers table booking services as well as displaying events on its platform. Ideally, the startup wants to brand itself as an end-to-end platform for both those looking to order from a restaurant or go and eat from there. Which makes sense.
 As it is now, diversification is becoming key to mitigating risks in the African markets. Recently, ride-hailing company Taxify crossed the boundaries and started admitting Boda Bodas on its platform. If this route works out for Simba Food, then I wont be surprised when Jumia Food starts offering it. 
 However, theres something Simba Food is offering that completely doesnt make sense. They are displaying events on their platform. Not only does it crowd the platform, Purnendu told me that they dont expect to make money out of it 
 That events section is a good thing we are keeping on our app. It is related to entertainment. But we are not looking at making money out of listing these events. It is just a service to clients that not only food youre getting on our app but also youre getting some other benefits as well [sic], said Purnendu Mukherjee.
 When you closely look at the Simba Food app in Google play, youll notice that it was developed by Sun technologies, a company from UAE. So, Software world is leasing the Simba Food app from Sun technologies for use, according to Purnendu.
 There are other apps under Sun technologies from Ugandan restaurants on Google play. These include Prunes, The Lawns, Taste Budz Uganda and more that you can check out here.
 Sun technologies also provides white-label app solutions. So, if any restaurant wants to have their own app, they can have it from Software World official partner of Sun technologies in Uganda [sic], said Purnendu.
 Purnendu also said that the company is currently funded by two directors. Who also have interest in venturing into other e-commerce products. Apart from Simba Food, Software World  the parent company, has another service called Simba Online Bar a direct competitor to Jumia Groups Jumia Party.
 What Simba Food is doing is basically what Jumia Groups parent company, the German-based Rocket Internet [Disclosure: I used to work for Rocket Internets Jumia Group in Uganda] has been accused of doing for some time  cloning others. There have been accusations of cloning Facebook, Airbnb, Uber and more.
 Only that this time around, in the African market, it is the other way round. Everyone is cloning Rocket Internets Jumia Group.
 On the continental level, currently, UberEats and Jumia Food are leading the food delivery business. However, to show how lucrative it has become, even SafariMeals recently launched in Somalia.

"SunFunder Reaches First Close On New $85m Solar Energy Debt Fund
","Last week, SunFunder announced the $42.5m first close of their new Solar Energy Transformation (SET) Fund with anchor investors the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), Calvert Impact Capital, Ceniarth and the IKEA Foundation. SunFunder has now closed $104.5m in its debt funds from 65 investors.
 The SET Fund is a nine-year fund that will enable SunFunder to expand its debt financing options for high impact solar energy projects and companies in emerging markets.
 “The SET Fund opens up new opportunities for SunFunder. As our largest and longest fund, it increases both the range and size of debt capital offerings that we can provide, especially for productive use solutions and commercial projects.” said Ryan Levinson, SunFunder founder and CEO.
 “We’re grateful for the support from this investor group and pleased to be growing these long-standing relationships. Building trust and creating repeat opportunities for investors is key to scaling energy access.”
 The first close includes OPIC’s $25m commitment of senior and junior debt announced last September. Since then, Calvert Impact Capital contributed $7.5m and Ceniarth contributed $5m, both to the senior tranche. The IKEA Foundation provided a grant of $5m as catalytic capital for the fund.
 Ray W. Washburne, OPIC President and CEO, commented: “This project will advance OPIC’s mission of empowering people in some of the world’s poorest countries, by bringing affordable electricity to remote areas that are not connected to an electricity grid.
 Jennifer Pryce, President &amp; CEO, Calvert Impact Capital, commented: “We’re thrilled to work with this group of lenders to meet SunFunder’s growing capital needs. Continuing to scale proven fund managers like SunFunder is critical to creating access to capital for local businesses that are leading the energy transformation.”
 SunFunder has now deployed $65m of debt financing to 46 solar borrowers in Africa and Asia, directly improving access to clean energy for over 5 million people while mitigating more than 450k tons of CO2 emissions annually.

"Flutterwave expands to Uganda making it their fourth African market
","Last week, payments technology startup  Flutterwave  finalized its expansion to Uganda. It had a team in Uganda that was carrying out the integration with the local payments service providers (PSPs) which includes telecoms, banks, and others.
 This was confirmed by Omosalewa Adeyemi  who handles partnerships for Flutterwave from their San Francisco office  through a call.
 “At this point [last week], we have a few people in Uganda right now that are actually integrating,” she told me.
 What this expansion means is that businesses that have clients in Uganda can be able to receive payments using Flutterwave’s system.
 At the same time, businesses in Uganda with operations in markets which Flutterwave supports will be able to receive payments from these clients.
 “So what that means is that if there is a business in Nigeria that determines that they have customers in South Africa and Uganda, we want them to be able to use the Flutterwave platform to accept payment in all those countries,” Omosalewa told me.
 Although some of Flutterwaves services  like card payment processing  are available in almost all African countries, according to Omosalewa, this expansion makes Uganda just the latest country where they have all their services localized. That’s after Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.
 She says this is because unlike other parts of the world, Africa is different. Partly due to its diversity. For example, while as one can use card payments across Europe and the US, that’s not the case for Africa. Each country has its own way of accepting payments.
 For the part of Uganda, that implies MTN Mobile Money and Airtel Money. “We are now focusing on localizing in Uganda so that we can offer a full coverage of the payments ecosystem in Uganda,” Omosalewa said.
 As part of the expansion, the startup is also recruiting “agents” that it will leverage to onboard merchants. And Omosalewa confirmed that they are in conversations with several potential partners.
 “Usually, when we enter a new market, we understand that payment is all about partnerships so, we do a survey of that country, that region to figure out who the best partners for us might be,” she pointed out.
 The agents are usually companies or hubs and these earn a commission per transaction handled by acquisitions they bring to the Flutterwave platform.
 So far, they are in talks with The Innovation Village Kampala to act as one of their agents. This was confirmed by both Kawanguzi Japheth and Omosalewa.
 “In the case of Innovation Village, when we took a look at them, we understood that they have a lot of startups in their ecosystem and are well connected to the technology and just general entrepreneurship scene in Uganda, Omosalewa said.
 The other party is Roundbob according to the emails I got ahold of. Which is understandable. Given both Flutterwave and Roundbob participated in the recently concluded Alibaba eFounders Initiative that took place in Hangzhou.
 It was attended by Flutterwave’s co-founder and COO while Roundbob’s David Gonahasa (founder and CEO) represented it. A place I believe the conversation could have started from.
 Especially when you take into account that it is David that is introducing Flutterwave to several potential partners in the market.
 Also read: These are the Ugandan startups in Hangzhou participating in Alibaba’s eFounders Initiative
 “We have always planned in the second half of 2018 to grow our presence locally in Eastern as well as Francophone Western Africa,” Omosalewa explained.
 Adding that “it just so came at the right time that during eFounders fellowship, our co-founder made some connections that helped or will help speed our operations locally in all these countries.”
 Asked if they will set up an office in Kampala, she told me that it is likely that they will do so as long as it makes business sense. Though this will be at a later stage.
 “Our model is that we launch fully in a new country [and] we onboard a number of merchants to use the platform,” she explained.
 
 “Once we can establish a business case, we set up an office and hire local staff who are familiar with the market and that process usually takes between three to six months.
 
 Founded in 2015, Flutterwave aims to “build a unified digital payments infrastructure for the African continent.” Last year, they raised an over $10 Million Series A from Greycroft, Green Visor and Omidyar Foundation.
 It currently has clients in form of Uber  whom it processes payments from drivers in Africa for  as well as pay those very drivers for. The other one is Transferwise.
 Flutterwave has participated in both Y Combinator and VC Fintech Accelerator program. Last year, they raised an over $10 Million Series A from Greycroft, Green Visor and Omidyar Foundation. They currently stand at just over 80 employees spread across their offices in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and the US.
 Beyond Flutterwave, the other alternative in the market is DusuPay. Though it primarily focuses on inflows from the UK.

"TechCrunch Disrupt SF to host Africa-focused segment for the first time
","TechCrunch has announced its agenda for the upcoming Disrupt San Francisco event scheduled to take place from September 5th to 7th 2018. When you take a look at the agenda, youll notice  on the last day of the event  a segment thats focused on Africa.
 Themed The Future of African Tech with Tayo Oviosu (Paga), it is set to focus and shade more light on Africas, steadily, growing startup landscape.
 Elite members of Africa’s startup landscape like Paga Payments chief executive Tayo Oviosu talk to us about the challenges and opportunities in one of the newest (and most exciting) emerging markets for tech entrepreneurship, read the caption.
 Apart from Tayo, other key figures across the continent are expected to join though not yet announced. The caption added that others [speakers wholl join Tayo are] to be announced as it is TechCrunchs policy to keep a couple [of] tricks up our sleeves.
 Also read: TechCrunchs Startup Battlefield is coming back to Africa
 Though, notable investors  especially those that have backed companies like Andela, Flutterwave, Cellulant and more  with noticeable ticket sizes  should be expected to be among those invited to join Tayo Oviosu.
 TechCrunch is slowly taking interest in Africa. First was through their Startup Battlefield organized last year in Nairobi with Facebook, which was followed by a monthly round-up of activities on the continent on their blog.
 Earlier this year, they also held a meet and greet in Lagos and Ghana.
 Combined and the upcoming Startup Battlefield in Lagos, one can conclude that their interest in the continent has matured.
 Beyond TechCrunchs interest, the African startup landscape has also scored some notable notches at various events across the world this year.
 At South by Southwest, African startups had a fair share of recognition  with Tayo Oviosu also present. Additionally, the recently concluded VivaTech in Paris also accommodated the African startup scene on its agenda.

"These 11 Ugandan Entrepreneurs have received a total of $140,000 from USADF in 2017
","According to Ugandan entrepreneurs, lack of capital is a big hindrance to starting up. Despite all this, there are a couple that are securing funding to push their ventures ahead.
 
  
 
 
 One of the sources they have continued to rely on is grants. Something that has received criticism for breeding grantpreneurs. A set associated with laziness. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Yet, that is still subjective. Plus, grants fund an area of entrepreneurship that is very risky for early investors. If not unattractive. Some of the organizations at the forefront of giving out grants are USAID and USADF.
 
 
  
 
 
 The United States African Development Foundation (USADF) is a U.S. Government agency. Established by Congress, the agency supports African-owned enterprises. Especially those which improve lives in poor and vulnerable communities in Africa.
 
 
  
 
 
 The agency offers seed capital and local technical support in form of grants. These go to early-stage agriculture, energy and youth-led enterprises in Africa.
 
 
  
 
 
 According to the agencys official website, it gives grants ranging from $50,000 to $250,000. Yet, among those on this list, none got $50,000 plus. In fact, the highest is $25,000. This implies that even if you need an amount below $50,000, you can apply.
 
 
  
 
 
 We bring you a list of 11 young Ugandan entrepreneurs that have received a total of $140,000 from USADF in 2017 so far. In case youre considering applying for the same, you can consult them on how to approach the process.
 
 
  
 
 
 Agribusiness leads the list with four ventures followed by Health with two. The rest of the sectors each has one venture.
 
 
 1. Francis Xavier Asiimwe
 
 
 Francis is a founder at Kaaro Health Finance. 2017 has been a good year for Francis and his venture  Kaaro Health. The Ibanda-based venture got selected by Berlin-based accelerator F-LANE for its acceleration programme in Berlin.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Kaaro Health Finance Limited (KHF) product solutions are designed to eliminate or mitigate both energy and finance access issues by providing tailor-made, flexible lease-to-own medical and renewable energy equipment financing to private healthcare entrepreneurs who are already operating or intending to expand into underserved rural areas, reads the summary of the startup.
 
 
 
 2. Rhodah Irakiza
 
 
 Rhodah is the founder of Mr. Gift. a social enterprise focused on improving access for smallholder flower farmers to local markets by improving the supply chain according to the summary from USADF. Rhodah secured $10,000 to help her grow her venture.
 
 
 3. Emmanuel Luyinda
 
 
 Being a YALI fellow, Luyinda is not new to benefitting from US Agency opportunities. He was also among the Tony Elumule 2017 fellows. A founder of Village Chicken, he secured himself $10,000 from USADF to grow the enterprise.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 A social enterprise focused on empowering rural women in Kavule, Luwero district to start and run sustainable and profitable poultry ventures and to supply nutritious chicken meat and eggs to the community, reads the summary of the venture.
 
 
 
 4. Hashim Mutanje
 
 
 Hashim is the founder of SolaPipo which secured him $10,000 from USADF. SolaPipo, according to the USADF summary, seeks to match consumers’ energy needs with available, suitable energy solutions through its SolarPipo app.
 
 
 5. Jonathan Asuma
 
 
 Jonathan is the founder of agribusiness enterprise called AgroStretch. He secured himself $10,000 to grow the venture.
 
 
  
 
 
 AgroStretch Limited develops sustainable, efficient and affordable products and service for smallholder farmers to increase their profitability. It has developed a Fresh Tomato Bank to process tomatoes into a puree and enable tomato farmers to minimize their post-harvest losses and obtain a fair and steady price for their produce, reads the summary from USADF.
 
 
 6. George Bakka
 
 
 He is the founder of Angels Initiative, one of Ugandas angel investment networks. George received $25,000 from USADF to finance other entrepreneurs that had problems accessing capital to launch their ventures. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 In Uganda, it is difficult to access capital to start a venture or expand an existing small business. George invests in people, so they can invest in small and growing businesses in East Africa. He matches opportunities and provides a credit rating system to consumers to stimulate future investing, reads the summary of Georges venture from USADF. 
 
 
 
 In a conversation with George a few weeks ago, when we asked him whether he was still running Angels Initiative, he replied; Not Much. Though he insisted that its still active.
 
 
 7. Tonny Kwanga
 
 
 Kizimba Social Enterprise is the enterprise that secured Tonny $10,000 this year. It is a social enterprise focused on goat breeding and rearing and providing necessary skills training in modern farming to youth farmers.
 
 
 8. Denis Moi Kiprotich
 
 
 Denis is the founder of Slopes of Mount Elgon Honey. A project to provide gainful employment to disabled persons as beekeepers, while at the same time reversing the worrisome decline in the bee population and honey production in Uganda. Denis secured $10,000.
 
 
 9. Charles Mubiru
 
 
 Charles founded Life Tomorrow which is social enterprise focused on proper waste management, specifically to improve the quality of life and environmental conditions in Mukono Municipality in Uganda. He, also, got $10,000 from the agency.
 
 
 10. Fiona Rukwanzi
 
 
 Fiona is the founder of Nyunya. Nyunya is a venture that produces a probiotic yogurt which offers health benefits to consumers with varying conditions, including diabetes and digestive disorders such as diarrhea caused by infections.
 
 
 11. Brenda Katwesigye
 
 
 Brenda winds up the list, and this has definitely been the year for the Wazi Vision founder. Brenda received $25,000 to help her advance her venture.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 In Uganda, more than 10 percent of school children have undiagnosed vision problems, but could not afford prescription eyeglasses, even if they had their eyesight tested. Brenda is tackling these intertwined problems by providing a cost-effective, mobile diagnostic vision test, and turning recycled plastic into affordable eyewear for low-income students, reads the summary of Wazi Vision from USADF.
 
 
 
 Brenda has landed several opportunities in 2017. This includes the recently secured $800,000 funding from GreenTec Capital Advisors. (See also: Wazi Vision Secures $800,000, Joins Safarini Translator and Divine Masters as Ugandan Startups Funded by GreenTec Capital)
 
 
  
 
 
 Judging from the list, in case youre considering applying, the majority are social enterprises. Others, that are not social, directly impact people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Which implies, that you stand a higher chance to secure a grant if your venture focuses on the two. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Starting November 15, 2017, USADF will be receiving applications from agricultural cooperatives, small-scale producer groups, and ag-processors. You can see details here.

"Facebook is giving AIMS $4 Million to launch an African Master’s in Machine Intelligence
","The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) has announced the launch of a one-year intensive African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI). This is in partnership with Facebook and Google.
 “Today, AIMS announces the launch of a one-year intensive African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) in partnership with Facebook and Google.” AIMS wrote yesterday in a press release.
 Facebook also confirmed in a blog post saying that “this program will bring together some of the most talented African graduate students to pursue research and engineering careers in machine learning.”
 Also read: Rwanda signs MoU with Andela to establish “the first Pan-African tech hub” in Kigali
 The social media company will contribute financing as well as avail its researchers to the institute.
 “Facebook will provide funding of $4M as well as world-leading researchers from our labs in New York and California (USA), Montreal (Canada) and Paris (France) to directly support the training and education of these master’s students.”
 By doing this, it believes that it will strengthen its “ongoing commitment and investment in supporting communities across the [African] continent.”
 Google hasn’t pointed out how much it will be contributing. Though, its Lead of AI  Jeff Dean  commented on the partnership. He said;
 
 “The field of machine intelligence is advancing rapidly, and it’s imperative that industry leaders including Google and Facebook, continue to partner with academic institutions like AIMS to develop the next generation of students who will build MI that benefits everyone.”
 
 This partnership with AIMS follows the search company’s opening announcement of opening an AI center in Ghana. And Jeff believes it is another step towards supporting the continent in the fields of AI and Machine Learning.
 “Along with our recent announcement of a Google AI center, scheduled to open later this year in Ghana, this partnership with AIMS is another example of our long-term investment and commitment to Africa.”
 The program will commence at AIMS Rwanda this September, with a planned launch in other African countries in the near future.
 The Institute believes that “creating an effective, globally connected community of Machine Intelligence practitioners in Africa” will reduce the technology gap in Africa. It will also strengthen the continent’s economies and enable better governance.

"CB Insights puts Q2 2018 investment in African fintechs at $63M
","A report by CB Insights has pegged investment into African fintechs (VC-backed) at $63 Million for the period of second quarter 2018. According to the report [PDF], this is a record investment when compared to the past four years.
 In Africa, VC-backed fintech companies in Q2’18 raised $63M across seven investments, more funding than the last four years combined, the report noted.
 When compared with the previous year, investment into African fintechs this second quarter was up 133% as compared to the same quarter the year before [YOY].
 
 Compared to all the other continents, Africa had the biggest jump in fintech investment the second quarter when compared to the first quarter (QOQ) in 2018. The continent had 99.6% QOQ jump in fintech investment. It was followed by North America with 48% QOQ jump and then Asia with 1.4%.
 Europe and South America, on the other hand, suffered a dip in investment. With South America (-89%) having the biggest dip while Europe experienced a 20% dip in QOQ fintech investment.
 Also read: Africa’s Talking is expanding to 6 African countries at once
 The huge jump could either be due to the fact that this is the first time CB Insights is including the African continent in its fintech reports. Or, it could be the methodology the company uses.
 CB Insights doesnt include grants, loans, or equity financings by the federal government, state agencies, or public-private partnerships to emerging startup companies. Yet these were the primary ways to fund startup across Africa initially.
 Additionally, they do not include debt or loans as well as contingent funding. If a company receives a commitment for $20M subject to hitting certain milestones but first gets $8M, only the $8M is included in our data, the report points out.
 The report covered lending, crypto, regtech, personal finance, payments/billing, insurance, capital markets, wealth management, money transfer/remittances and mortgage/real estate.
 Other revelations that the report found was that the quarter saw 5 new unicorns born. That is Indias Policy Bazaar, Revolut in Europe and TradeShift, DataMinr, and Circle in the United States.
 Q218 saw five new unicorns births, bringing up the total VC-backed unicorn count to 29 worth a combined $84.4B, CB Insights noted.
 When it comes to the VC firm with the most number of Unicorns in its corner, Ribbit Capital is leading the pack. Ribbit Capital is the most active fintech unicorn investor, followed by QED Investors, CB Insights noted.
 
 500 Startups, founded by Dave McClure, led in terms of deals into fintech startups between Q217 and Q218. It made over 13 investments in that period into fintechs like YayPay, WeTravel, First Circle and more.
 It was followed by Ribbit Capital, CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund, NYCA and Omidyar Network  which also invested in Lidya.
 Ant Financials $14 Billion was the biggest deal in the quarter followed Dataminrs $392 Million and Robinhoods $363 Million.

"Acumen&#8217;s $70M fund KawiSafi Ventures has already deployed $21M
","In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 600 million people currently live without electricity and spend $17 billion a year on dirty, inefficient energy. On April 17, 2019, Acumen  a US-based nonprofit organisation that makes early stage investments in sustainable and socially minded businesses officially announced the launch of its energy-focused fund.
 The fund, KawiSafi Ventures, was announced through Acumen’s subsidiary Acumen Capital Partners. The US $70 million fund is aimed at accelerating access to clean energy solutions for low-income populations in East Africa.
 The KawiSafi Ventures fund aims to deliver clean, affordable energy to 10 million people, at least half of whom live in poverty, and displace more than one million tons of carbon dioxide in the next 10 years, to address energy poverty and help avert the current climate crisis
 According to a press release shared with Digest Africa, KawiSafi Ventures has already deployed part of the funds raised. “To date, KawiSafi has invested $21 million to impact 4.3 million people and avert 360 thousand tons of carbon dioxide emissions,” noted the press release. On their website, the fund states that they have invested in BBOXX, d.light design, Lendable and Redavia Solar.
 In an email to Digest Africa, the fund pointed out that they also “recently invested in Opes Solutions”, a Berlin-headquartered off-grid solar module company. They did not reveal how much they invested in the company. Though the fund informed Digest Africa Africa that they make equity investments of between US $4 Million and US $8 Million.
 KawiSafi Ventures is only being made public now, but it has been investing in energy startups operating across East Africa dating back to more than three years ago. In August 2016, it participated in BBOXX’s US $20 million Series C according to CrunchBase data. The firm also led d.light design’s US $15 million Series D in September 2016 as well as Lendables’ US $6.5 million Series A in October 2017.
 The fund’s limited partners include Green Climate Fund, AXA IM and Acumen. KawiSafi is managed by Acumen Capital Partners LLC, an Acumen-owned subsidiary that structures and manages funds investing in social enterprises poised to scale to transform the lives of low-income people everywhere and solve some of poverty’s most significant challenges.
 According to Digest Africa Data, other than KawiSafi Ventures, the additional notable energy focussed fund raised in 2018/19 was the $42.5m Solar Energy Debt Fund managed by Sun Funder.
 In 2018 and 2019 to date, there have been other notable investments made in the renewable energy sector, these have included Zola Electrics ($87.5m), PEG Africa ($26.5m), Daystar Power Africa ($26.0m), Azuri Technologies ($22.4m), M-Kopa ($10m+), Solar Now ($9.7m). The more massive investments are mostly in the form of debt financing or late venture (Series C+) investment.
 Except for PEG Africa and Daystar Power Africa, the big players in terms of funding raised appear to have an East Africa region focus. Also, predominantly, the companies backed have been co-founded or have executives originating from either North America or Europe.

"My response to TMS Ruge&#8217;s &#8216;Why Venture Capital hasn’t taken off in Africa&#8217;
","This is a response to TMS Ruge’s Article titled Why Venture Capital hasn’t taken off in Africa. To his expression about what he calls White-Fronting. This is when an African startup recruits a white person as a co-founder to get VC financing. While as the definition says African startup, I prefer to say developing economy. And, for the white-person, I prefer to say someone from a developed economy.
 
  
 
 
 This also includes related ideas I had already given thought before reading TMS’. VCs haven’t shown as much appetite in developing economies compared to the developed. To explain that, you need to understand their key selection criteria. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Every VC web-page or VC-blog you read shows that they accord almost 90% to the founding team. Most VCs or Accelerators will fund a great team, even with a lousy idea or model. And for a good reason. I mean, given an early-startup with an unknown future what is your next best ‘right-now’ gauge? The Team.
 
 
  
 
 
 One blog i read said, in a world where 9 in 10 startups fail, VCs will choose the ones that are less likely to fail. They believe the strength of the founders has much to do with increasing chances of success. 
 
 
  
 
 
 But, this is much in theory and rationale otherwise why do more startups fail even with great teams? You definitely need a great team but there has to be a Balance, the idea needs to be great as well. 
 
 
  
 
 
 So the BIG question is, why are teams from developing economies neglected most of the time?
 
 
  
 
 
 Again, to understand this, you need to know what look for in an individual on a team. Education is the key here. If you have a Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxford, Wharton, Caltech and other big names, it speaks a bunch. Not about the quality of education you received, but sums-up your knack to succeed  generally. 
 
 
  
 
 
 It speaks about your past. You don’t get admitted to top universities without standing out of the crowd. Africans trained from these top schools stand on almost equal footing with peers from Developed Economies. But why is this gap there, anyway?
 
 
  
 
 
 There is still a knowledge-gap between Developed and Developing Economies. This stretches over half a millennium. It could be more considering that the church mandated free education in the 1100s AD in Europe. While the first formal African school opened in 1658 in Cape Town. Never mind it was a school for slaves as the white man sought to make slaves more useful to him. 
 
 
  
 
 
 As some Europeans paid for education, this slave school had to reward pupils  adults  for their presence. They, each received a glass of brandy and two inches of tobacco daily. 
 
 
  
 
 
 We generally had to be colonized to receive life-changing knowledge. Yes, we had an education before but it was not only undocumented but also rudimentary. Training fermentation, weaving, backcloth making etc was verbal and by observation. 
 
 
  
 
 
 But this is the killer. To communicate between villages and kingdoms swift runners had to relay information. And, it was verbal. The developed economies had there fair share of these rudiments in the BC era.
 
 
  
 
 
 The knowledge gap is why top-ranking universities  over 400  are from Developed Economies. It is the same reason top global corporations are from Developed Economies. 
 
 
  
 
 
 You can extrapolate this to all social, health, economic and political sectors. And, the best are from developed economies because of earlier exposure to knowledge.  The white mans forefathers used their knowledge superiority to their advantage. But, colonization like all things had it’s advantages and disadvantages.
 
 
  
 
 
 Since we are in the information era, knowledge gap is the cause of almost all other differences. Even when the Internet has done wonders in closing it, it still haunts us. It might take another century to close in on it if at all. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The more knowledge you have about a subject the better the ways you are going to use it to better lives.  
 
 
  
 
 
 Children in Developed economies get exposed to knowledge very early. Compare the day of an American teen, say, Zuckerberg and Gates, to that of an African. While the former is tinkering with computers and reading, the latter is in the garden til midday. Then plays football or other games after lunch, fetches water and firewood in the evening. 
 
 
  
 
 
 While the American goes to top schools, the African gets a medium quality education. But, the best in developing economies. So, at what point will the African catch-up? 
 
 
  
 
 
 With all the wealth of knowledge, someone in a developed country gets exposed to. What are the chances that he will build a global company? And, if you are a VC, who is more likely to deliver the returns your profit-hungry investors pay you to make?
 
 
  
 
 
 My observation is that even people in developing-economies prefer ‘DEVELOPED’ products and services. Right from the tooth-pick, if one can afford a European made tooth-pick, they won’t buy one made in Uganda. 
 
 
  
 
 
 And it doesn’t necessarily have to carry a ‘Made in Germany’ label. The stark difference in quality alone makes it the preferred choice. And, this is a natural and logical disposition. I mean, why should I buy a tooth-pick that will prick my gum? To increase my dental budget when I can afford a better designed one.
 
 
  
 
 
 For example, how many products made in a developing country do you use? On your phone or PC, how many local apps do you have? I guess none. I have no more than 2 local apps on my phone and none on my PC. This is the case anywhere you go, except China.
 
 
 They call us developing countries, because of this knowledge-gap between DEVELOPED and DEVELOPING economies.
 
 
 It means we have a developing health, financial, social and everything sector. Including the software-development sub-sector. It also means the products and services are developing or immature.
 
 
  
 
 
 So, the idea of “white-fronting” TMS Ruge describes in the above article is to the VCs’ a more realistic bet. Their ambitions are in safer uncertain waters because of this knowledge advantage. Those that “white-front” get to tap into the knowledge wealth of developed countries. But, also be part of building global companies. 
 
 
  
 
 
 I don’t know about the startups that have white-fronted so far. But, I would court the right developed-country citizen as co-founder(s). Not to get Venture Capital, but to harness this knowledge advantage. To build a defensible global company and maximise the impact of a startup’s benefits.
 
 
  
 
 
 Like Entrepreneur First CEO Matt Clifford says, “Maximising impact is the essence of ambition, so ambitious individuals seek out paths that give access to their era’s dominant ‘technology of ambition’.” 
 
 
  
 
 
 Knowledge can get transferred through close interactions with more knowledgeable people. So, this would be another opportunity. To close the knowledge-gap above, and also transfer it to future generations.
 
 
  
 
 
 Why are we actually not talking about African VCs? Don’t you think it takes knowledge to understand the importance of VCs but also to manage a successful VC? We don’t have African VCs because we lack money? (See also: KENNETH LEGESI takes a look at the Alternative Sources of Funding for Ugandan Startups)
 
 It is because the people who would be in a position to own African VCs lack knowledge of the importance of VCs. The knowledge to manage thriving VCs. So, we have to rely  for now  on VCs in developed economies. The very ones that are averse to our startups because of this knowledge-gap. 
 
 
  
 
 
 If 10 in 100 startups that have white-fronted manage to hit global markets in 10 to 20 years, we will see 5 to 10 African VCs.
 
 
  
 
 
 As the VC bubble shudders to burst on US startups  Reuters, GV  developing economies are ready to develop solutions to worse challenges. With so many global challenges, we don’t need another selfie or photo-sharing app. Yet, US VCs will still invest millions in such ventures.

"Mazima Retirement Plan Presents a Challenge to Uganda&#8217;s FinTech Startups
","On Thursday, this week, Mazima Retirement Plan and Financial Services Deepening Uganda (FSDU) together with Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority (URBRA) and the Competitive Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MOFPED) as well as Callund Consulting organized a one day workshop at Hotel Africana.
 The workshop was aimed at the discussing the findings of a feasibility study for micro-pension market in Uganda. It was carried out by Callund Consulting (UK) and Micro-Pension Foundation (India) with Support from FDU.
 According to the study, Uganda, and indeed other developing countries are grappling with the question of how to extend pension to the informal sector. Therefore, the question at the workshop was whether micro-pension can be the solution.
 According to Livingstone Mukasa, Micro-pension is used to refer to a form of insurance that allows small contributions over sustainable long periods.
 Micro-pension is an opportunity to allow every working Ugandan make an affordable contribution according to their age or income towards their retirement package  Livingstone Mukasa
 Currently, theres significant exclusion when it comes to savings for retirement. Until last year, when Mazima Retirement Plan and Kampala City Traders Association were granted licence to operate as the very first informal retirement plans, National Social Security Fund (NSSF) was the only available option for anyone who thought of saving for their retirement  yet it only covers those in formal employment.
 Uganda is estimated to have 15 Million in employment but only around 2-3 Million are covered by NSSF. This means the remaining, who are largely in informal sector had no way to save for their retirement. With the introduction of Mazima Retirement Plan, which is leveraging the already adopted telecom platforms of mobile money, informal employers as well as employees are able to save for their retirement.
 Mazima Retirement Plan, which started just in March 2016, currently has a number of over 720 subscribers with savings amounting to 400 Million. They are working in partnership with Housing Finance Bank as the scheme’s custodian and African Alliance Limited as the Fund Managers. Currently, one can save using Airtel and MTN Mobile Money platforms to easy collection of member savings but standing orders and direct deposits are also accepted.
 One of the challenges, according to Livingstone, that Mazima is facing is trust  which issue is faced by any plan or company that handles peoples money. Naturally, people are not quick to trust someone with their money. However, Livingstone is optimistic that the endorsement from the regulatory authority as well as partnerships with the telecom companies can help address this issue.
 One of the challenges that Livingstone Mukasa hinted on was the fact that Mazima needs to work on its technology. What is even more exciting is that he believes in locally bred solutions which is a very huge opportunity for local fintech startups that are dedicated to solving such problems.
 We need to work on our platform. We dont think our technology is where we need it to be in form of serving our clients and i think that can be done in Uganda  Livingstone Mukasa
 Given that very few people in their prime age have had no retirement packages, apart from depending on their sons or daughters in the working age bracket. This had eventually become a viscous cycle making it impossible for one to set aside an income that they can invest for the future. The question is whether the plan can eventually be able to translate into a breeding ground for the next generation of local investors?

"Ntinda-based Techbuzz Hub launches a Startup Facility Program, is it worth it?
","Techbuzz hub, a co-working and business incubation centre, is launching a startup facility program aimed at giving entrepreneurs a headstart in their early stages. Some of the issues the program is looking to tackle include; the high rates of startup failure as well as the scarcity of funding.
 Startups Facility Program is a comprehensive six (6) months facilitated program recommended for starters, budding entrepreneurs, startups, innovators, and managers, says the statement sent to us.
 Organisers of the program say that participants will be facilitated with mentorship and training to structure, grow and create an investable startup business. Itll involve both online and physical modules.
 
 The Hub has arranged a program that lasts six months of online and physical capacity building divided into two-threes. Two months online training and mentoring, Two months Free office space utilization and Two more months of half office space fees contribution after which we believe ones Startup, concept or idea has obtained a structure capable of attracting capital and more likely if it deals with products, Is able to have started generating revenues, the statement added.
 
 The program is mainly targeting people looking to start side businesses, entrepreneurs, innovators and fresh graduates. In order for one to be admitted into the program, theyre required to part with UGx. 300,000. Although this is a good concept and looking to address.
 While this is not a bad idea and concept, the main question is about the mentors the program is looking to use as it doesnt mention them anywhere. It would give one confidence to apply if at all they knew exactly what to expect.
 Secondly, Techbuzz has been around for slightly over a year and it seems theyre biting more than they can chew. From internships, a co-working space, fortnyht series to now the mentorship program, the hub  a startup in itself  seems to be losing/lacking focus.
 Kenneth Twesigye, who last year used his Tony Elumemlu Entrepreneurship Programme grant to inject in the hub, and currently heading it cant boast previous experience in running a hub.
 While as we still have a lot of issues to be tackled as a growing startup ecosystem, I think one should focus on a thing at a time. Others will take up what shall be left. Otherwise, good luck.
 Note: Earlier on we reported that Techbuzz was less than a year old. That wasnt true. The hub was started in August 2016.

"Ugandan Energy Startup, Mandulis Energy, Endorsed by Kofi Anan, Strive Masiyiwa and Co.
","Mandulis Energy has been named as one of Africas most innovative solutions to Powering Africa! They were featured prominently in the Africa Progress Panels Lights Power Action  Electrifying Africa Report March 2017 which is a follow-up on the 2015 report themed People Power Planet: Seizing Africas Energy and Climate Opportunities.
 The Africa Progress Panel consists of ten distinguished individuals from the private and public sectors who advocate for equitable and sustainable development for Africa. Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and Nobel laureate, chairs the Africa Progress Panel and is closely involved in its day-to-day work. The other Panel members are Michel Camdessus, Peter Eigen, Bob Geldof, Graça Machel, Strive Masiyiwa, Linah Mohohlo, Olusegun Obasanjo, Robert Rubin and Tidjane Thiam.
 The Africa Progress Panel brings about policy change through a unique combination of cutting-edge analysis, advocacy and diplomacy. The life experiences of Panel members give them a formidable capability to access the worlds of politics, business, diplomacy and civil society at the highest levels, globally and in Africa. As a result, the Panel functions in a unique policy space with the ability to influence diverse decision-makers.
 It is in the Lights, Power, Action report that Mandulis Energy team was named one of top four Africa’s entrepreneurs leapfrogging to a low-carbon economy. Others included M-Kopa (with operations in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), Sahelia Solar (with operations in Burkina Faso) and Africa Biogas Partnership Programme (with operations Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burkina Faso).
 A quick look at the companies listed above will give you a clue that East Africa is leading other African regions when it come to the use of renewable and clean energy.
 Mandulis Energy generates reliable and affordable electricity from agri /agro-processing waste for grid and off-grid communities in emerging markets. This they do through two arms; REPARLE (Renewable Energy Powering Agriculture and Rural Livelihood Enhancement) and EARTH ENERGY.
 REPARLE is an off-grid rural electrification project in Uganda, led by the French NGO ACTED, and Mandulis Energy, with support from USAIDs Power Africa program, and EARTH ENERGY is their 20MW grid-tied biomass power project in Gulu, Northern Uganda, which is backed by KfW, African Development Bank and Power Africa.
 Towards the end of 2016, the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) approved on a $993,000 grant to Earth Energy, to prepare the first-ever biomass gasification project in the Uganda, expected to add 20 Megawatts of baseload power to the national grid.

"Uber and Jumo partner to create a car asset financing product
","Uber and Jumo  a Cape Town-based fintech  have partnered to create an asset financing product, dubbed Jumo Drive. The product is going to be rolled out across Sub-Saharan Africa after a successful pilot in Kenya.
 Justin Spratt, Head of Business, for Uber Middle East and Africa explains, “Earlier this year, Uber and JUMO ran a pilot with a select number of Uber drivers in Nairobi who were pre-approved based on their driving behaviour. Based on the success of the pilot, we are happy to bring this innovative financial solution to driver-partners in Sub Saharan Africa.”
 According to the press release, Jumo Drive will aim at easing barriers to car ownership for existing Uber driver-partners. Applications to join the initiative need no upfront costs, no sign-up fees and no deposits.
 To arrive at the credit allocation decision, the JUMO Drive and Uber app will work together to generate and facilitate the credit scoring and application process for the drivers.
 According to JUMO, the entire sign-up process, from logging in, to credit approval, can take less than 15 minutes. And can see drivers on the road in their own vehicle in under four weeks.
 The drivers will get access to a tracking device and a service and maintenance plan. This is to ensure they are able to keep their vehicle up and running in good working order.
 
 JUMO’s unique data prediction capabilities utilise driver behavioural data to facilitate credit scoring and offer JUMO Drive to qualifying driver-partners.
 
 The driver’s earnings, trips and behaviour patterns determine the credit risk score of the drivers, which ensures each driver receives an offer that is individually designed. Bank partners on the JUMO platform will provide the finance for the vehicles.
 Across Africa, it is not uncommon to find that most Uber drivers do not own the cars. This means a decrease in their take-home. Additionally, it also takes away the incentive that comes with of ownership. It was, thus, a matter of time before one came in to ensure that to these drivers.
 Earlier this year, Tugende  an asset financing company in Uganda  raised $5 million from OPIC. Part of the goal was to venture into financing cabs.
 Although their target wasnt particularly Uber drivers. It is, however, not hard to understand that majority of their clients are likely to be such drivers. From Uber, Taxify, Little and other ride-hailing companies.
 Lending is now a default part of most SME facing startups in Africa, thanks to the hardships SMEs face in accessing credit.
 Last year, Jumia announced that it would start lending to vendors in Kenya, while South Africas YOCO  which raised $16 million this year  also started giving loans to its merchants.

"Bitcoin 101: Understanding the cryptocurrency from a beginners perspective
","
 If youre like me, then you started 2017 never ever knowing what Bitcoin, let alone Blockchain, was. But, because of the many stories about it in media, you became curious. Though, till to date, you still are struggling to get a basic understanding of what Bitcoin is. This is for you.
 So what is Bitcoin?
 Many know it as a cryptocurrency. While others mistake it for the definition of Blockchain. As simple as that. But, Bitcoin is a currency like Ugandan shillings, Dollar or Naira. Only that you cannot see or touch it. What we call a digital currency, and only exists in the digital world.
 Unlike the normal currencies we already use, you cannot print a digital currency. There is no central bank like Bank of Uganda printing an controlling it, yet.
 You could be wondering, how did Bitcoin come into existence?
 Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world in 2009. So, it is important that we talk about him first.
 First of all, nobody knows who he is. Is he even a he in the first place? Is it a secret society? A new government? Nobody knows. Till today the individual remains anonymous. At one point, people thought Teslas Elon Musk was Satoshi Nakamoto. But he came out and denied it. Please, feel free to choose if this is scary or cool. I can’t decide.
 Back to Bitcoin. Nakamoto, in 2009, created a domain name bitcoin.org. He then released a paper [PDF] breaking down his idea of an electronic cash system. decentralized and under no control of any government in the world. He started making it a reality by releasing the bitcoin software.
 If the software is in place, how do we get these bitcoins?
 One gets Bitcoins through a process called digital mining. And, the same way you don’t start digging up your backyard for gold, you need to search for where to get these Bitcoins. This search under is a complex mathematical equation which a miner has to solve.
 Look at it like the equations in school requiring you to find X and Y. You have to look for Y’s sister-in law’s cousin and kill off his best friend’s cat. That kind of complex.
 So, you the miner, after solving this equation get rewarded with bitcoins. Miners are also rewarded for verifying these bitcoin transactions. The recordings of these transactions get saved under a ledger called a ‘blockchain’. Hope I haven’t lost you there.
 
 Also read: Africa and the Blockchain Revolution
 
 But, think of a Blockchain as a public statement of transactions. Every bitcoin transaction gets verified and ‘cryptographed’. Which is a language of codes. To understand these codes, compare with secret codes of mobile money transactions. No two can be similar and duplication is not possible for forgery. That’s how it works.
 Since its release, many miners joined in on bitcoin. With that came more complex math equations, and fewer bitcoin released each time.
 Nakamoto made sure that for bitcoins to remain valuable, they need be scarce. And, as such only 21 million exist and approximately 13 million mined to date. Miners globally have merged to create mining pools to solve these ever-getting-complex equations.
 Now, you may want to know where bitcoin owners keep their hard earned coins. More like;
 Where is the bank for these coins?
 Since they are digital coins, they enter ‘digital wallets’. Not your actual wallet, rather your digital wallet.
 An owner of bitcoins opens an account by entering an address. Then, he/she is granted public and private keys. Those keys contain all your transactions in codes as well as proof of ownership of those Bitcoins. Again in codes, yes people. This is all digital and codes reign supreme here.
 You can keep these ‘keys’ in a digital wallet. That is where you keep your ‘coins’ safe. Who knew there would be a point in life where you had to keep coins safe? Coins are winning, I tell you.
 People are calling cryptocurrencies the future of transactions. But;
 How does Bitcoin affect the ordinary Ugandans?
 For now, cryptocurrencies will face a hard battle to win over the ordinary Ugandan. But, reflect on this; if you said years ago that people  even in remote areas  would transact on their phones, youd get laughed at. So, indeed, it’s a hard battle but a winnable one.
 An expert once said a currency is as strong as its people’s backing of it. So, cryptocurrency will only flourish in Uganda, if it gets backing from people. But, in order for people to back it, general sensitization needs to take place  to shut down the sceptics.
 It didn’t help at all when Bank of Uganda warned the public to not invest in this digital revolution. Thus, before aiming at ordinary Ugandans, top financial institutions is the first step. Because masses love backed credibility. In other words, we need somebody to blame if things go wrong. So, support from top financial institutions  especially the central bank  is key.
 Patience will also have to be a virtue for the tech community. It will take time. Especially for the minor crypto-community to engage financial policy makers, to make this a generally acceptable medium of exchange. A virtual currency stored in virtual space is a hard sale to the status quo loving nature of Africans in general.
 It is also important to consider that the cryptocurrency revolution is an uncharted territory globally. It’s only starting to sort itself out. There are fears of hacking and a general meltdown of the entire system. All these make it volatile and risky. But, the question is;
 Can one afford to ignore the cryptocurrencies completely?
 The answer to that is NO. Knowledge is power. You may not get involved with cryptocurrency, but it doesn’t hurt to be in the loop of its ongoing revolution.
 Once many fears are curbed, then as said before, this might be what the future of transactions looks like. And, who doesn’t like a glimpse of the future?

"Kenya&#8217;s M-KOPA raises additional $10 Million in funding
","Kenyan-based pay-as-you-go energy provider M-KOPA, has raised $10 Million in funding. FinDev Canada, Canadas newly launched development finance institution, announced the deal yesterday [13/04/2018] as reported by Cision. The institution was making its very first transaction.
 FinDev Canada was joined in the deal by existing investors, CDC Group, the United Kingdoms development finance institution.
 The deal is coming just 5 months after the company announced its biggest round of funding so far. An $80 Million debt facility led by Stanbic Bank.
 M-KOPA has raised a mixture of debt and venture capital since 2011. According to its CrunchBase profile. With its Series A and Series B coming from the same investors, led by the U.S. based Gray Ghost Ventures in October 2011 and December 2012 respectively.
 The $10 Million raised brings the total funding raised by the company to at least $162 Million since 2014.
 So far M-Kopa says that it has “connected 600,000 homes across Africa. Adding that it has provided 75 million hours of kerosene-free lighting each month.”
 Also read: We raised funding from Greentec &amp; Village Capital, Henri Nyakarundi
 Jesse Moore, M-KOPA CEO, said that “this investment will help us to bring power to another one million households over the next five years.
 According to the statement, “women stand to gain the most from this off-grid solution as they carry the majority of household responsibilities, availability of electricity will have a transformative impact on family life.”
 
 “M-KOPA also offers good-quality jobs for women, with 52% of 800-plus East African workforce of permanent employees and 44% of their commissioned sales agents being female.”
 
 Early this week, by Kenyan Wall Street, reported that M-KOPA laid off “18% of its staff including 78 developers.” Jesse confirmed it. Saying that, “we completed a restructuring process in December 2017” to “reduce fixed costs and keep us on the path to profitability”.
 Founded in 2011, M-KOPA currently operates in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania as well as Ghana and Côte dIvoire through a licensing agreement with PEG Africa in 2014. The company, together with Eseye, license the M-KOPAnet technology to third parties outside of East Africa. Eseye partnered with M-KOPA Solar in 2011 to develop the platform’s application framework.

"Just Jose: Using Uganda&#8217;s Music Industry Networks to Build EasyTicket
","According to Just Jose, EasyTicket is a ticketing company which is currently doing both physical and online ticketing. It has been in existence for now 5 years and they believe now is the perfect time to be in existence because they offer convenience to the young and burgeoning young Ugandan population thats both tech savvy and outgoing.
 We spoke to Just Jose aka Joseph Mwima about the ins and outs of their venture. In case youre wondering who Just Jose is, he is one of the most prominent Ugandan audio producers. If you remember hits like Ability (Radio, Weasel and Rabadabda), the Whistle Song (All Stars), How we do it (Keko) and many more. He was the man behind them.
 The team
 EasyTicket was founded by John Masembe, Jasi Kassami, Kevin Lubega, Mahmoud AbdulRahman and Just Jose aka Joseph Mwima. They currently employ 2 people permanently and around 30 as part-time staff.
 Just Jose, and the team of several co-founders, decided to venture into the ticketing business and thinks hes in the right business when he looks at the networks and contacts hes built. He has formerly managed the bookings for Radio &amp; Weasel as well as other prominent artists abroad as well as locally. This, he believes, is invaluable to EasyTicket.
 Clients
 It is also no doubt that most of the clients that EasyTicket has surround Just Joses networks. He points out House of DJs, Talent Africa as well as Bobi Wine as some of them. To these he was very thankful for the opportunity and support they have given them even as just an early stage startup.
 Quicket is a technology partner with EasyTicket
 Making Money
 Given that EasyTicket sells tickets both online and offline, they implore a hybrid model of making money. They take a commission off each ticket they sell through their website as well as charge for tickets they print for clients who decide not to use the online ticketing route.
 Figures
 From handling 2 events a year, just few years ago, EasyTicket  last year  handled over 60 events which brought the number of tickets sold to over 40,000. Of these, over 10,000 were sold online and the rest were physical. He however notes that they started selling physical tickets in August with the Uganda Entertainment Awards being the first.
 Busabala, Bobi Wines Boxing Day event, contributed over half of the offline tickets last year. They proposed physical tickets to Bobi Wine after understanding that his crowd wasnt tech savvy, which turned out to be a success.
 Expansion
 So far they have expanded to Rwanda. This happened early in 2017 and they are also looking at expanding to Kenya. Currently, the Rwanda business is being managed remotely from Uganda but as business grows, theyre looking to set up shop there permanently.
 EasyTicket was contracted to handle the ticketing for Morgan Heritage in Uganda
 Partnerships
 The team has been able to secure various partnerships to enable them penetrate the tough terrain. One of them is KCCA FC. They currently manage all games for the team. He also points out the fact that FUFA president Magogo thanked them for bringing sanity to sporting events. Surprisingly, Jose says that the sports events need ticketing experts more than any other.
 They have also secured a partnership with Quicket, one of the leading ticketing companies in South Africa. This one is particularly for the ticketing technology. Another crucial partnership is with AC Group which has operation in India, Cameroon and Rwanda. This was setup particularly to aid in their new plan of venturing into transport ticketing. Jose confirmed that theyre in talks with one of the biggest local bus companies to handle their ticketing.
 Another crucial partnership theyve struck is with White Sand beach (former Spenah Beach) and theyll be handling their ticketing for Saturdays and Sundays.
 Market Dynamics
 Jose cites a particular scenario of a fraudster who setup a Morgan Heritage Event, which was officially managed by EasyTicket, on Eventbrite and sold a couple of tickets to people. These were left stranded at the gate.
 These are some of the dynamics in the market that one needs to take note of. He also stresses that this is where EasyTicket has an upper hand over foreign ticketing sites like Eventbrite  the ability to offer a local solution to a local problem.
 Future Plans
 At the end of our conversation, Jose promised that they are launching a new platform to make the user interface more appealing. He also hinted on an App that was developed to entirely help event organizers monitor the performance of their events.
 We asked, since sports events need more of the services, why they havent approached FUFA to handle ticketing for the entire league as well as Uganda Cranes games. Jose revealed that they have tried to move the card before but with no success.
 He thinks this is because majority of the fake ticketing is done by internal staff and they do not want a solution to this given they currently earn an extra dubious income this way.
 He also believes theres still a gap in the railway and the entire transportation business. He cited the recently launched SGR in Kenya. They are trying to venture into ticketing for transportation.
 Challenges
 Though EasyTicket has been able to start and take off with no external financing, Jose still cites finance as one of the biggest hurdles to their expansion and growth. He however didnt show any signs of seeking for external support.
 International Trend
 Theres been a growing trend of rappers in the US funding or running startups. Some example include Chamilionaire, Jay-z, Snoop Dogg and many more. In Nigeria, we saw Don Jazzy teamed up with Dele Odufuye to launch Flobyte that offers free Wifi in public.

"Uganda&#8217;s CiplaQCi set for IPO with a valuation of US $12.5 Million
","CiplaQCi, a Ugandan pharmaceutical manufacturing company has started its journey towards listing on the Uganda Securities Exchange. This was revealed through a 129 paged prospectus [PDF] which also detailed the companys operations, financial performance, management team and expansion plans.
 The prospectus points out that CiplaQCi has a share capital of UGx. 45,648,865,000 (roughly $12.5 Million) and looking to sell to the public 657,179,319 shares of the 3,651,909,200 total issued shares at UGx. 12.5 ($0.0034) par value. That, according to the prospectus, translates into 18% stake of the company.
 The offer will open on 13 August 2018 and close on 24 August 2018.
 The company has set up a couple of advisors for the IPO including; Renaissance Capital, Crested Capital, Bowmans Uganda, Ernest &amp; Young, Standard Chartered Bank, and C&amp;R Group.
 Umeme was the last local company to list on Uganda Securities in 2012 followed by Kenyas Uchumi in 2013. CiplaQCi, therefore, will become the first company to list in the past 5 years. This will also make it the 9th local company as well as the 17th company on the exchange.
 CiplaQCi is controlled by Mauritius based Meditab Holdings Ltd which owns 51.05% stake. The other current shareholders include UKs Cipla EU (11.25%), the three Ugandan founders who own 3.6% each, Mauritius registered CapitalWorks and Amistad with 14.4% and 12.5% respectively.
 Also read: Anthony Natif on lessons he learned from aggressive expansion, running out of money and finally raising around $3 Million
 However, Indias Cipla Limited ultimately controls the company with 62.3% given it owns both Meditab Holdings Ltd and Cipla EU.
 The pharmaceutical company has previously raised Private Equity investment as well as struck strategic partnerships and investments. That was from PE funds CapitalWorks and TLG Capital as well as Cipla EU, an arm of Cipla Limited.
 These, especially the PE funds, could be the ones forcing through the IPO as they seek to exit from the company that was founded 13 years ago. Given the prospectus lists them as the selling shareholders together with some Ugandan founders of the company.
 Emma Katongole, CiplaQCis founder, and current Executive Chairman, also pointed out that this offer is a sale of shares by the selling shareholders.
 Adding that, otherwise, the company can continue self-financing both its immediate and future plans.
 The Company is well capitalized, is cash generative and has sufficient resources to self-fund its growth and, as such, does not anticipate the need to raise any primary capital at this time, Emmanuel pointed out in the statement.
 There havent been much opportunities for technology investors across Africa to exit in form of IPOs. Therefore, although not a technology company, this is an opportunity for any tech founders and investors who are looking to take the same route to watch how everything unfolds.
 CiplaQCi was founded after Cipla acquired a majority stake in Quality Chemicals which was founded in 1997.

"According to CB Insights, there are only 3 unicorns in Africa
","There are only three unicorns in Africa according to a recent report by CB Insights. The report which pegs the number of unicorns in the entire world at 266, listed Nigerias Jumia as well as South Africas Promasidor Holdings and Cell C as the only ones from Africa.
 Founded in 2012, Jumia is the most notable one among the three. The company is rumored to have gained the unicorn status after raising $326 million in funding from backers including Goldman Sachs and MTN in 2016.
 TechCrunch reported that Jumia co-CEO Sacha Poignonnec confirmed that the financing brought the companys equity to €1.005bn ($1.08bn). While CB Insights pegged the companys valuation at $1.04 Billion.
 Recently, Bloomberg reported that MTN  the majority stakeholder in Jumia with 40%  was considering selling its stake in the e-commerce company. And, the valuation that they were considering was still above a billion dollars.
 The second unicorn on the list is Cell C, which is a Johannesburg-based telecom company founded in 2001.
 The company offers a wide range of products and services, including voice, data, and messaging services to more than 16 million customers. Products include Straight Up, Straight Up Standard, Infinity Select, SmartChat, ChatMore, MegaBonus, 99c for REAL, EasyChat, and 66c prepaid.

 CB Insights pegged the companys valuation at $1 Billion with investors including Blue Label Telecoms and Net1 UEPS Technologies. Cell C joined the club on August 8, 2017, despite raising $530 Million in 2003.
 Promasidor Holdings is also based in South Africa. It is a supplier of quality, nutritional, and affordable food products in more than 30 African countries.
 Founded in 1979, CB Insights pegged its valuation at $1.58 Billion with investors including IFC and Ajinomoto from Japan. Promasidor, like Jumia, joined the unicorn club two years ago on November 8, 2016.
 According to CB Insights, a unicorn company or unicorn startup is a private company with a valuation [of] over $1 billion. For its list, it put the total number of unicorns across the world at 266. These all have a combined valuation of at least $862 Billion.
 Uber leads the pack with a valuation of $72 Billion and joined the club five years ago. Chinas Didi Chuxing ($56 Billion), Meituan Dianping ($30 Billion), Airbnb ($29.3 Billion), and Elon Musks Space X ($21.5 Billion) crown the top five in that same order.

 The unicorn status is determined in a rather subjective way and one can argue that some companies that should be included are left out while others that shouldnt be included are. For example, many believe that Nigerias Interswitch is a unicorn. Yet it doesnt feature on the list.
 But, as we are talking about the unicorns, the valuations of private companies and startups are escalating. This is leading to the creation of more and more names.
 Currently, there are decacorns like Uber, which are valued at over $10 billion. But, everyone is waiting for the first hectocorn, valued at over $100 billion. Perhaps Uber will be the first to hit it.

"Sign up as an Informal Mentor and Support Micro-Entreprises
","Seed40, an initiative established to identify and invest in microenterprises through an informal network of mentors, is calling for those interested in signing up with it as mentors to sign up.
 It is running a seed programme from which various micro entrepreneurs can benefit. If you are inspired to mentor an unlikely entrepreneur who can benefit from our seed programme, seed40 encourages you to sign up.
 Mentors, and not the micro-entrepreneurs, are required to share a compelling story of the business and how they intend to support as well as the value the grant Seed40 gives will add to the micro-entreprise.
 This is expected to be done in a short video of the maximum length of 5mins.
 Entrepreneurs are discouraged from making applications, and instead, the mentors should. The scheme will fund a microenterprise per month.
 Applicants are however encouraged to apply at any time during 2017 as all applications will be carried over every month for consideration.

"INTERVIEW: Bitcoin is currently useless for remittances to Uganda &#8211; Asindu Willfred
","If you havent heard of blockchain technology, at least you have heard of cryptocurrency. If not, then at least bitcoin. Bitcoin is largely responsible for making cryptocurrency and blockchain mainstream.
 Those involved in bitcoin, cryptocurrency or blockchain argue that one shouldnt ignore it. They even emphasize that especially those involved in fintech must have a strategy for it. Yet, despite the fact bitcoin is grabbing headlines across the world, few seem to understand the applicability of cryptocurrency, let alone what it is.
 To be able to understand this in the Ugandan context, we engaged Asindu Willfred from Coinella for a quick interview.
 Startup Digest Africa: Many people are talking about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in every corner of the world, Ugandan included. But, whats Cryptocurrency to a layman?
 Asindu Willfred: A Cryptocurrency is basically a form of money that is digital in nature just like Mobile Money or Airtime Credit. The difference between it and Mobile Money or Airtime credit is that it is decentralized in nature.
 Let me explain what I mean by decentralized; For instance, Mobile Money is regulated by centralized entities like Telecom companies &amp; financial regulatory bodies. And, they do this for the sound reason of reducing counterparty risk like keeping cheats &amp; fraudsters at bay.
 If the system was not regulated this way, companies like MTN would clean your balance to zero and you would have no one to complain to. You can notice there is an element of trust.
 As for the decentralized paradigm of Cryptocurrencies, you dont need such a body like a central bank or legal entities to keep track of who owns what or who paid who.  Everything is stored in distributed, tamper-proof type of database called the blockchain that depends on of game theory and cryptography.
 Related: Blockchain technology could be Ugandan banks’ answer to mobile money
 SDA: How can it be applied in Uganda?
 
 AW: The no-brainer application would be that cryptocurrencies can be used to reduce remittance fees. But, some companies have discovered it is not that easy. Bitcoin is currently useless for remittances. I may have to write about this some other time to make it more understandable.
 Yet there can be applications around customer loyalty, and in border payments like ticking, the point of sale, crowdfunding, accounting and social banking. The maturing field of smart-contracts can drastically reduce the legal costs in the finance sector.
 Some of the application is what Coinella is working on. But for working examples here in Uganda you can check out eSACCO &amp; Clic World. Unfortunately, there are too many scammers like Onecoin/D9 in the space.
 SDA: Now that we can see its application in the Ugandan context, when do you think itll become mainstream in Uganda?
 AW: I hate to be the astrologer here. But, my speculative estimation is that it will take a maximum of two years from now for people in this country to take notice of the significant impact brought about by cryptocurrencies.
 For instance, this year we had an engagement with the people behind the Stellar Lumens platform. Lots of products including Coinella are building products around this.
 SDA: Two years is quite near. So, what should people do to position themselves to take up the opportunities it presents?
 AW: It depends on your skill set or interests. Investors, for instance, may want to invest in companies like eSacco, Xente or Coinella that are integrating blockchains to their service. It could also be startups looking forward to launching an ICO (initial Coin Offering). Software developers may also want to look into smart contracts and blockchain protocols like IPFS or Ethereum.
 SDA: As we wind up, is there any other notes people in Uganda should know about cryptocurrency?
 AW: If you are in Fintech and not doing anything blockchain/cryptocurrency related, you better look for your blockchain strategy.

"SafeBoda releases a feature that let&#8217;s you take the nearest boda
","SafeBoda has announced that theyll be releasing a new feature called PAIR today [29/03/2018]. According to the official statement from the ride-hailing company, the new feature allows you to pair instantly with a SafeBoda rider on the street!
 The statement added that it is designed to be used in busy areas with a high volume of bodas available, the feature allows passengers to spot a SafeBoda rider, enter their helmet number into the app and match with them instantly.
 Traditionally, transportation in Uganda is on-demand. For example, if one wants to board a taxi, they just stand on the road and the first to come is what theyll board. The same applies to cabs and boda-bodas.
 Yet, technology hadnt been able to solve this problem. There was no way one would board the nearest SafeBoda. This is perhaps the leading reason some people still use other bodas or dont hail them through the app.
 Also read: SafeBoda unveils new offices and logo
 The introduction of this feature means that passengers are still able to use the app. Something thatll allow SafeBoda tap into the market of those not willing to wait for 5 minutes.
 Co-CEO, Maxime Dieudonne says, “SafeBoda’s mission is to constantly innovate to make
 transportation in urban areas safer and more convenient. We’re really excited about this new feature which will reduce waiting time to zero.”
 This new feature is simple and easy to use in four steps: Spot a SafeBoda rider close by, tap PAIR in the app, enter the rider’s helmet number and match instantly with no waiting!
 The feature has been under testing for now over five months. Towards the end of last year, I was invited to participate in a focus group discussion about it. My verdict is that it has been long overdue.

"Ugandan Innovators dominate the 2018 Africa Prize shortlist, ahead of Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya
","The Royal Academy of Engineering has announced 2018  shortlist for its Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation, and Ugandan innovators have dominated the list. The announcement was made by the Academy in Cape Town, South Africa. Where all the shortlisted innovators are. 
 
 The shortlist, which is dominated by Ugandans  with four innovations  recognizes the most talented engineers from across sub-Saharan Africa. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The Ugandans are Alvin Kabwama, Brian Gitta (who was represented by Shaifc Sekitto), Arthur Woniala, and Lawrence Okettayot. Uganda was followed by Kenya and Nigeria with three innovations each. The total list has 16 innovators. (See also: Alvin Kabwama on His Experience in Silicon Valley and Why Innovating in Health isn’t for the Get-Rich-Quick). 
 
 
  
 
 
 This years includes innovators working to make malaria and reproductive health tests easier, using dolphin-inspired echo-location for visually impaired people. As well as recovering precious metals from car parts for re-use in manufacturing.  
 
 
  
 
 
 The Africa Prize, launched in 2014 by the Royal Academy of Engineering, is awarded after a six-month programme. 
 
 
  
 
 
 This, according to the official press release from the academy, provides a unique package of support, including funding, comprehensive business training, bespoke mentoring and access to the Royal Academy of Engineering’s network of high profile, experienced engineers, and business development experts. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The shortlist, which represents the fourth group of engineers supported through the Africa Prize, also features several digital innovations. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Among them are mobile apps that grant micro-loans within minutes, an app that makes it easy for musicians to manage bookings and sell merchandise, and another to help commuters book one of the 20,000 trips taken daily on motorcycle taxis in the city of Kigali, Rwanda. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Agricultural innovations also feature strongly. They include sensors that send soil information to farmers’ phones straight from the field, an online platform that helps farmers triple their yield, and a low-tech dehydrator that extends the shelf-life of crops tenfold, improving food security. 
 
 
  
 
 
 “Turning engineers into entrepreneurs is vital to unlocking the creative solutions that exist across Africa,” said Africa Prize judge, Moses Musaazi said in the press release. 
 
 
 
 
 The Africa Prize’s support gives engineers the confidence to approach funders, clients and investors, and the knowledge to improve their supply chain and business models.”
 
 
 
 The Africa Prize also recognizes process engineering represented this year by innovations to generate power from the many radio waves that are around us every day, and for producing affordable biogas from manure for household use.
 
 
  
 
 
 Two educational solutions include an app that hosts a variety of courses and a mini-science lab that fits into an ordinary school backpack.  A smart meter that allows customers to manage their utilities, and a solar-powered walk-in cold room complete the impressive shortlist. 
 
 
  
 
 
 “The Africa Prize recognizes talented engineers from across the continent – supporting countries that aren’t typically seen as a source of innovation,” said Rebecca Enonchong, Africa Prize judge.
 
 
 
 “This diversity helps drive more innovation during the programme, amplifying their potential for real economic and social impact.”
 
 
 
 After six months of mentoring and training, four finalists will be selected from the shortlist. In June 2018 the finalists will present their businesses to judges in front of a live audience, after which one winner will receive £25,000, and three runners-up will be awarded £10,000 each. 
 
 The shortlisted candidates are:
 
 
 
 Alvin Kabwama from Uganda with UriSAF Maternal and Sexual Reproductive Health Care Kit, which tests urine quickly, accurately and affordable.
 
 
 Arthur Woniala from Uganda with Khainza Energy Gas, a cheap biogas made from manure and safe for household use.

 Emeka Nwachinemere from Nigeria with Kitovu, an online platform that helps farmers in remote locations to increase crop yields and sell their produce
 
 
 Esther Gacicio from Kenya with eLearning Solutions, an interactive online programme that hosts courses for individuals or serves as a tool for training institutions
 
 
 Ifediora Emmanuel Ugochukwu from Nigeria with the iMeter and AMI solution, which gives electricity consumers and power utilities control over electricity use
 
 
 Lawrence Okettayot from Uganda with Sparky Dryer, a low-tech dehydrator that dries fruit and vegetables to extend their shelf life and reduce food wastage
 
 
 Michael Asante-Afrifa from Ghana with Science Set, a mini science lab with all the materials needed to do the science experiments in a school syllabus
 
 
 Monicah Mumbi Wambugu from Kenya with Loanbee, a mobile phone application that calculates the user’s credit scores and grants micro-loans
 
 
 Nges Njungle from Cameroon with Muzikol, an online music marketing and social media app designed to meet all the career needs of musicians
 
 
 Nnaemeka Chidiebere Ikegwuono from Nigeria with ColdHubs, solar-powered walk-in cold rooms that extend the life of perishable food tenfold
 
 
 Peter Kariuki from Rwanda with SafeMotos, an app that connects commuters to the safest motorcycle drivers in Kigali, Rwanda
 
 
 Shalton Mphodisa Mothwa from South Africa with AEON Power Bag, which allows users to charge their phones on the go by converting radio waves and solar energy into power.
 
 
 
 This is not the first time Uganda is getting represented on the Africa Prize shortlist. Let alone have an innovator among the winners.  This year, Yaaka Digital Learning Network   an online platform where teachers and students can share their academic knowledge as well as materials  by Hindu Nabulumba was among the three runners-ups that walked away with $10,000 each. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The Africa Prize is supported by The Shell Centenary Scholarship Fund and the UK Governments Global Challenges Research Fund.

"This 13-year-old self-taught Ugandan software developer has 15 paying clients
","Andela, one of Africa’s successful startups has a catchy tagline; Brilliance is evenly distributed. Yet, the opportunity is usually not. That has been the case for the African gifted, until the arrival of the internet and technology. The two have democratized opportunities, especially for this Ugandan software developer.
 Sam Epodoi, a self-taught software developer basically Googled his way to kickstarting a software development career. At 13 years, he is among the young and tech-savvy Africans using the internet to create and leverage the opportunities it presents.
 Also read: Liquid Telecom releases report on “the generation that will define Africa’s digital future”
 “I do web development and designing commercially, Sam replied when I asked what he does. Adding that, “ I also do [mobile] apps and desktop apps. Though, he noted that design is more of a hobby.
 As a young boy, Sam got introduced to software development as a result of frustration. He noticed a lack of applications that he needed.
 Sometimes, I would look for certain Apps, but I couldnt find them so I wanted to learn how to make my own,” he says. He credits Google for his initiation into Software development. The other credit goes to his friend who guided and encouraged him.
 “My friend, he is older, right now he is like 17, was also one of the people who introduced me and inspired me.”
 Though he doesn’t recall the exact application he wanted, what he knows is that he was 9 years at that time.
 Despite all this, it wasn’t until his parents started supporting him that he started taking off. “Once my parents discovered that [i was good at software development], they took me to meet other people,” Sam says. Some of the people he met included “mentors who do the same thing, so I could learn from them.”
 Parents like Sams are rare in Uganda. Since many still prefer their children to undergo the traditional system. Those that come close take them to International Schools.
 But, Alex Nkusi Shyaka  one of Sams mentors says that theres a growing list of such parents. According to him, theres now a big number of parents who are now homeschooling their children. I was surprised to a how many [parents] are now embracing tailored education [for their children], Alex says. Theres this whole growing movement of them.
 Sam during his very first hackathon at Hive Colab in Kamwokya
 Clocking 12 years, in June 2016, and after nearly three years of coding, Sam landed his first client. “There is this company in my neighborhood called Paint Night Kla, Sam says. So they asked me to design a website, and it was my first one.
 This first gig sparked a growth in the number of paying clients, all from word of mouth. “I did it and they were impressed,” he says. Then “someone went to their site and asked them who did it?” and, according to him, that is how it all started. His dad then stepped in to aid in the acquisition of more clients.
 Many University graduates in Uganda struggle to find meaning employment. IT graduates included. Yet, at his age, he has so far worked with over 15 paying clients to his name in less than 2 years.
 Ever since his first client, most now come through word of mouth referrals. “Most of the clients I get are word of mouth,” he says. “I do work for someone and they are impressed, most of them come back and they also go and tell other people.”
 Sam Epodoi during a mentorship session with Alex Nkusi Shyaka, at The Innovation Village in Ntinda
 In a world filled with DIY, Do It Yourself, tools and a sea of website developers, Sam is able to charge between UGx. 200,000 and UGx. 800,000 per website. Though he still finds the price not only affordable for his clients but cheap.
 Currently, he is in 8th grade  which is an equivalent of S.2, going to grade 9 and points out juggling school and his passion as a key challenge. “One of the challenges is the school. Like I have to manage my time well,” he says. Adding that, “another challenge is sometimes when I write code and it doesnt work, its frustrating.” Alex also adds that theres “another challenge is boredom.”
 
 “These things, in the beginning, can be exciting but then when they reach in the middle, they get hard. When they get harder, people lose interest, Alex Nkusi Shyaka.
 
 But says that it usually stems from the lack of support, encouragement, and mentorship.
 Though he started with Python, Sam is currently proficient in HTML, TSS, Javascript, and PHP. Yet still looking to get better every day through various means.
 Alex says that he is involving him in competitions for personal development. “He is also involved in some competitions, so he puts his stuff out there,” says Alex.
 Currently, Alex wants to get him to work closely with the developers at Andela Uganda. Though worried that he might not be welcome to most of the programs and events due to legalities surrounding a person of his age.
 This is because companies dont want to use or work with children under 18 years. But Alex is trying as much as he can to see that Sam’s talent isn’t stifled by these legalities.
 So far, he has participated in hackathons at Outbox, Innovation village, and Hive Colab. “I think the first hackathon I attended. It was hive Colab, he says.

 It was last year in November. Yeah, we built a trafficking solution to stop trafficking. The project is on Github, so when am done launching Skill, I want to pull it and work on it more, and publish it.
 This year, Sam wants to launch his pet project. A marketplace for casual laborers called Skill. “Essentially, it provides jobs for casual workers, he described it.
 
 By casual workers, I mean plumbers, builders, helpers, and drivers. And it enables you to go and you search for them, and you are able to hire them. And we would verify that those are actual workers.“
 
 A mock-up of Sams Skill Project Website
 Besides that, he is looking to learn a couple of new things and travel. “[I am also focused on] learning new languages and developing much better solutions, he says. I would also like to attend some events, activities, and competitions outside Uganda.
 During our conversation, Sam informed me that “I would like to solve as many problems as I can.
 
 “One of the things, you know I want to be a serial entrepreneur. So I want to have started a couple of companies as well as being able to go and visit companies like Google.
 
 He hopes to visit Silicon Valley sometime this or next year. Perhaps, there, he will meet his inspiration, the currently under-fire Mark Zuckerberg. Whom he attributes his love and admiration to a “very fascinating and interesting” Facebook story.
 This interview was carried out with the permission from both Sams parents. I would also like to thank his mentor, Alex Nkusi Shyaka, for the efforts he put in to ensure we carry it out.

"Integrity in impact investing is a two-way street
","
 
 After six months of cultivating EWB Canada’s East Africa venture portfolio, and engaging with upwards of 100 social entrepreneurs in Uganda and Kenya, I have come to realize that investors can do better to nurture emerging innovators, to strengthen their capabilities and reduce their risk profile.
 EWB Canada is one of the handfuls of organizations proactively enabling early-stage social businesses in sub-Saharan Africa that have the potential to meaningfully improve the lives of vulnerable populations. As an early-stage impact investor, we have learned that the process to qualify a social enterprise for funding is often lopsided. Investors want to make smart investment decisions that will achieve both a desired social impact and financial return, but the time that is alloted to investigate these considerations can be frustrating and opaque for entrepreneurs.
 At EWB Canada, we regularly reflect on our approach to course-correct and better enable businesses that can help create an equitable and sustainable future. A lesson we have learned is that while it is necessary for investors to spend time assessing the integrity of an entrepreneur, it is equally important for investors to operate with integrity, approaching their search and selection process with greater consideration of emerging innovators, irrespective of the outcome.
 “I have experienced a number of investors who, after extensive due diligence including site visits, and back and forth lasting over six months, decide we are “too small” to invest in. This is often confusing for us since this is something that can be identified from one of the first conversations. As an early-stage entrepreneur, the time lost is one of the most frustrating things.” -Brenda Katwesigye, CEO &amp; Founder, Wazi Recycling, Uganda.
 Some impact investors have pioneered a 4-hour due diligence process with the belief that investors can make an informed investment decision about a prospective investee, using only 4 hours of an entrepreneur’s time. While such a process may not be replicable across all funds looking to scale their impact portfolio, the practice of implementing an honest process that equally respects the opportunity costs for both investors and entrepreneurs should be the benchmark.
 Also read Silicon Valley: Invest in Africa, But Do It Differently
 As socially responsible investors, we must consider the responsibility and the inherently skewed power dynamics that come with being on the “money side of the table.” The opportunities for entrepreneurs in emerging markets to meet with investors are less frequent than in more developed markets. It is important for impact investors to recognize how we are part of the larger entrepreneurship ecosystem in the geographies where we are present.
 There are a few different ways in which Impact Investors can be intentional about building integrity:
 1. Identify your impact investing philosophy
 As impact investors, check in with our values at the individual and organizational level. At EWB Canada, we strive to bring transparency, honesty and integrity to our engagements with social ventures whether we move on in the due diligence process or decide after one or two meetings not to proceed. Ask yourself what value would you like to add to the journey of social entrepreneurs, and to the wider ecosystem you are working within.
 2. Assess transparency in your selection process
 Is it possible to be more transparent and forthcoming about your investment process at the onset? For example, consider creating a short investment profile that outlines your investment criteria that you make available on your website, or share with entrepreneurs during initial discussions. This can help to manage expectations and set the tone for the specific kinds of impact your fund is looking to make.
 3. Build confidence in the entrepreneur
 If a deal is being pursued, demonstrate you are the right financing partner. Entrepreneurs go through tremendous effort to convince potential investors of their current and potential value. Likewise, investors should demonstrate their value and benefit to an entrepreneur to ensure confidence and clarity that this arrangement is mutually beneficial.
 4. If there’s no deal, add value anyway
 Impact investors should take a minute to think about what they can do for that entrepreneur. Can you provide more constructive feedback in your rejection correspondence? Can you make an introduction to another investor who may be more relevant? Can you spend more time contributing to building the entrepreneurship ecosystem in a particular geography by creating or participating in programs and events, even if they don’t lead to immediate deals?
 For instance, EWB Canada offers Open Investor Office Hours. Every other Friday afternoon, entrepreneurs can book advisory meetings with our investment team on specific challenges they are navigating, ranging from their business models or customer acquisition strategies to practicing their pitch. These one-on-one’s provide entrepreneurs with strategic input from the perspective of an investor in an ecosystem where this kind of access is scarce.
 We see a lot of impact investors using impact (either lack thereof, or not the kind the fund is looking to have) as the reason for not investing in an entrepreneur. While impact can be a part of the reason, it is often the case that there are some core elements of the business that the entrepreneur needs to improve, like diversifying their customer base or implementing accounting software. When impact investors are not transparent and forthcoming about these fundamental business truths, it is a lost reflection opportunity for social entrepreneurs, who are often navigating a lonely journey.  Nicole DeMarsh, Associate Partner and Head of Open Capital Advisors in Uganda.
 At a personal level, I strive to empower entrepreneurs by crafting specific, timely, and actionable feedback, sharing relevant funding, support or speaking opportunities, and making valuable connections for entrepreneurs regardless of whether they end up being a fit for EWB Canada’s fund  especially if they have invested time and resources going through our screening process.
 An investment is a relationship, and like any relationship, there are inherent power dynamics within it. As the party holding more of the power, impact investors must consider the wider impact of their presence in the ecosystem, even if it does not immediately increase their bottom-line.

"4 Things You Must Know to Run a Startup in Uganda Legally
","Often times, when one comes up with a nice idea, all they think of is translating it into is a very successful a startup. What they usually forget is the fact that their startup has to be operated in the real world and its success is partly hinged on how best it meets the legal requirements.
 Norman Mbabazi, a legal consultant who has worked closely with a couple of Ugandan startup founders on their Intellectual Property issues talks about some of the legal requirements startups should put into consideration.
 
 
 Picking a name
 
 
 This looks obvious but it is not as easy as you think. A lot of people have picked names only to find out that another business has the exact or very close name at the time of registration.
 The most important thing is to disassociate yourself from similarity and confusion. You need to find a name of unique nature so that your name is separate from that of an existing business or company  Norman
 Unless, you want to ride on the reputation of an already existing brand or get mistaken for it, then its advisable that you pick a unique name for your startup. The name, ideally, should also reflect what your startup does.
 2. Registering a business
 Under normal circumstances, one is supposed to register their startup before they can kick into operation. However, this is not the case for Uganda. Startups start operation and think of registration at a later stage.
 For the startup, registering should be able to help you actually find out if the name youre deciding to use is still available at the registry body or acceptable depending on which industry youre looking at operating in.
 There are a couple of structures your startup can take on at registration which include Sole Proprietorship, Partnership, Limited by guarantee or Limited by Shares.
 The kind of structure depends on the intentions of the startup founders. For example, if youre looking at promoting good will and youd like to have other people to give donations at some point and not for profit organization, then a Limited by Guarantee. Yet a profit making one should be registered as limited by shares  Norman.
 3. Labour Laws
 As a startup, chances are youre going to employ people at certain point to help you run it. However, this has its own legal implications. Uganda has labor laws that any operating business has to put into consideration. Norman recommends that before you think of employing others, first abreast yourself with these laws before they get you offside.
 You should know when to terminate ones contract or give disciplinary action, when to give maternity, paternity or sick leaves as well as compensations. You should check out for the employment act of Uganda for further details on this.
 4. Trading Licence
 As a startup, after registration, youll be required to obtain a trading licence from the authorities in your area of operation. But given the nature of startups in Uganda  being based online, it is a challenge for the authorities to implement this.
 Under NORMAL circumstances, if youre trading online, there are no specific laws in Uganda to treat or regulate online businesses  Norman
 But according to Norman, whether youre online or not, one should obtain a trading licence. This is because when the startup is deciding to open up a bank account, it is one of the documents theyll have to present. The other documents that a bank is likely to ask from a startup are; certificate of registration, constitution, a resolution, recommendation from a lawyer as well as the trading licence.
 In conclusion, as a startup, your focus is to scale as far wide as you desire. Yet ignoring any of the above may be a big dent to your ambition. The recommendation is that you prepare early to avoid the penalties that might affect your reputation as well as financially.

"Rwanda&#8217;s latest tech hub Westerwelle Startup Haus Kigali is set to launch
","Westerwelle Startup Haus Kigali, a new tech hub in Rwandas capital is set to launch. Located next to the Kigali Convention Centre, the hub is still testing its services with the official launch to follow soon.
 We’re offering startups and entrepreneurs the opportunity to try out our space at no-cost until the 31.10.2018,  Sarah Rukundo, the Community Manager wrote in an email.
 Theres been a growing confusion when it comes to differentiating between the terms hub, co-shared space, co-working space and others close to them. But, Sarah says that they are looking to run a hybrid model.
 
 It’s a really a hybrid between those things, Sarah wrote, adding that what they are doing is offering a platform for entrepreneurs, startups, and corporates to come together to innovate and scale their businesses.
 
 We will be providing various services such as co-working and private office space, a
 maker space, events, advisory services and professional development workshops. Some
 of these we’ll offer ourselves, some through partners.
 Westerwelle Startup Haus Kigali is near Kigali Convent Centre
 The hub has a capacity of 200 people and one can join through various avenues. Memberships stretch from just using the co-working space to private companies looking to associate with the hub.
 Currently monthly rates are; Flex[ible] Desk [is] RWF 100.000, Fix[ed] Desk [is] RWF 200.000 and Private office pricing upon request. Club Memberships for companies that don’t need office space but want to be part of our ecosystem start at RWF50.000.
 Westerwelle Startup Haus Kigali recently hosted the Seedstars Kigali event and hopes to be the center. According to Sarah, theyd relish organizing any future events like Seedstars as they align with their mission of building a community.

 Westerwelle Startup Haus Kigali is operated by the Germany-based Westerwelle Foundation and the second after the one in Tunis.
 The Westerwelle Foundation first started conceiving the project of Startup Haus centers in 2014 and launched the first space together with enpact in Tunis in 2015.
 The hub recently hosted the Seedstars Kigali event
 The foundation operates it and co-funds it together with the Evonik foundation.
 Hubs across Africa are struggling to come up with sustainable models. Many are still supported by development agencies and foundations. Yet Rebecca Enonchong, AfriLabs Chair, pointed out that Africa needs more tech hubs.
 According to the GSMA 2018 map for hubs across Africa, Kigali has around 4 hubs. This would be a great addition to the ecosystem.
 Though, like the majority of hubs across the continent, its funding is from a foundation.

 According to Growth Africa, their business scaleup acceleration programme is designed to help entrepreneurs scale their ventures, make them investment ready as well as develop their entrepreneurial leadership as individuals.
 The programme’s first phase consists of 18 workshop days spread over six months.
 The programme kicks off with a 5-day visioning bootcamp and then subsequently five 2-days workshops where they establish the foundation and equip the entrepreneur with tools to diagnose their business and devise strategies to optimise their business in all conceivable areas. This part ends with 3-day actioning bootcamp where enterprises come up with an implementation action plan for their 3-year vision.
 After each workshop, the participant will work in-company with the assistance of external business experts, called GrowthAfrica growth catalysts and financial modellers. These will be working to implement the participants new strategies and innovations – boosting their growth trajectory in significant ways.
 The second phase of the programme involves 24 months of one-on-one support from the GrowthAfrica team, a pool of external business leaders and support by GrowthAfrica’s investment facilitation team.

"Pan-African Edtech incubator, Injini, reveals second cohort
","Last night, Injini  a pan-African edtech incubator announced the startups admitted into its second cohort. This was at an event that took place at Amazons office in Gardens, Cape Town, South Africa.
 The eight startups that made it came from 5 countries and are all at educational stages according to Injini.
 Each of the companies had an opportunity to pitch for one minute. While a panel on EdTech in Africa featuring local entrepreneurs was also held.
 The selected startups are; Learning factory (Zimbabwe), eLimu (Kenya), Nahana Afrika (South Africa), Bluebic (Nigeria), Langbot (Ethiopia) Slatecube (Nigeria), ScholarX (Nigeria) and Lightbulb (South Africa).
 As you can tell from the list, startups from Nigeria dominated. A direct contrast to the first cohort portfolio  which also had 8 startups  where South Africa dominated.
 Also read: Apps Africa opens applications for its Innovation Awards
 The first cohort startups were; Accelerated, Early Bird (South Africa), M-Shule (Kenya), Mtabe (Tanzania), Syafunda (South Africa), Uthini (South Africa), Yo Books (South Sudan), and Zelda (South Africa).
 Injini held an event in Uganda at the beginning of the year at The Innovation Village. This was part of their tours across East Africa to encourage startups to apply. Unfortunately, the turn up was disappointing.
 In a separate conversation with Doreen Nabaho, Injins Head of Data Insights &amp; Analytics, she hinted at the fact that even the quality of applications from Uganda was still lacking. Perhaps thats the reason no Ugandan edtech startup made it to the list.
 Founded by Jamie Martin and CiTi, Injini is a South African edtech incubator that has so far run two cohorts. In their first cohort, the incubator says that received applications from 13 countries. An indicator that anyone from across the continent can apply.
 Their cohorts last 6 months, thus the second cohort incubation will take place from July to December 2018. Participating startup are required to part with equity depending on what level they are at.
 
 We take 9% (post-revenue companies) -15% (pre-product companies) equity in the main/parent company, wrote Injini on its website.
 
 They, thus, caution applicants that they should not accept a place if you dont want to give up 9% equity or only want to do it in a local division.
 In return, for the equity, the companies get the Injini programme and direct funding of $50k.

"Startup Profile: Arvana &#8211; Get a Digital Address Today
","What is Arvana?
 Arvana is a mobile application that gives anyone, anywhere the ability to generate a digital address using a smartphone. The goal is to create addresses that are easily searchable, shareable and usable in multiple use cases.
 The application uses the phone’s GPS to acquire the user’s precise location (coordinates) and the generated address is attached to these coordinates. In order to enhance the accuracy usability of these addresses, the application allows for provision of more information to increase the visibility of a place i.e. adding administrative boundary information, adding photos and adding directions.
 Solution
 It is the intention of the creators of the app that it helps in quicker delivery of emergency services especially to slum areas with poor road network and no physical address. It is also intended to support the spurring growth in e-commerce platforms as well as courier and postal services companies in the country. It gives the buyer an opportunity to order for anything online knowing itll be delivered to them.
 The address format generated by the Arvana App
 Funding &amp; Incubation
 Currently, Arvana is being incubated at the Makerere University School of Public Health Resilient Africa Network (RAN) Innovation Lab which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

 Final Thought
 Arvana is a good idea but i think they still have a big job ahead of them. With a competitor like google maps  which, obviously is more popular and innovative  they need to present an easier and better solution. The Arvana team needs to show that they understand the local environment more than anyone else.
 Secondly, i dont think having my address as a code in the format of #KMP0000 is cool  at all. I would love to have my address in either my name or a place near me  to be easily located.

"Here&#8217;s how GSMA startups are using mobile technology to deliver their services
","GSMA has released a report [PDF] that dives deep into how the startups in their portfolio are using mobile technology to offer services with impact. Titled startups and mobile in emerging markets, the report also gives insights into GSMAs ecosystem accelerator.
 According to the report, the GSMA has received over 1650 applications to its accelerator program. Out of these, due diligence has been carried out on 90 and 24 were able to receive funding.
 Max Cuvellier  the Head of Mobile for Development, Utilities and Ecosystem Accelerator at GSMA  remarked that the 24 startups have had an impact on millions of people.

 When it comes to measuring this impact, we are happy to report that the 24 projects we have been financing have collectively had a positive impact for over one million citizens, Max said.
 However, he also pointed out that the type of impact that each of these startups is having differs.
 The type of impact varies depending on the start-up, ranging from improved access to financial services in areas previously underserved to better availability of sustainably sourced fruits and vegetables or out-of-classroom educational support.
 That is because they are each using what looks to be the same technology for different purposes.
 Jamii is making mobile health insurance affordable for SMEs and low-income

 Yet, at the back of all these startups are telecom operators who have over the past decades laid the much-needed foundation and infrastructure. This ranges from the network to programs aimed at supporting such startups as well as partnerships.
 In April 2017, Vodacom Tanzania and Jamii entered a revenue-sharing partnership. Additionally, Jamiis services are included in the menu for Vodacom M-Pesa service.
 Jamii is listed on Vodacom’s mobile money (M-Pesa) menu, which Jamii uses to collect premiums and pay out micro insurance claims to hospitals. M-Pesa has played
 a significant role in cutting the administration costs of supplying insurance to Jamii’s customers by 95 percent.
 The report also pointed out the key mobile operators and startup collaboration in the emerging markets. In Kenya, Safaricoms investee m-survey raises $3.5 million from TLCom Capital to launch in South Africa.

"Women are taking the lead in smartphone ownership in Uganda, National IT Survey
","Earlier this week, the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance and NITA-U held a dissemination workshop to discuss key findings from the National IT survey of the National IT Survey 2017/2018.
 According to a statement from NITA-U, the survey was conducted amongst Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), Local Governments (LGs) and Households from across the country in 2017.
 The main objective of the study was to ascertain the status of Information Technology in terms of availability, access and usage, affordability and satisfaction with IT infrastructure, equipment and services.
 One of the main findings of the survey was that women are taking the lead when it comes to smartphone ownership. 15.8% of individuals that owned mobile phone indicated that it was a smartphone, NITA-U tweeted.
 This implies that for every 100 people that own mobile phones, 16 have a smartphone.
 Adding that a higher proportion of female individuals owned smart phones [sic] (18.1%) compared to male individuals (13.4%). Implying that for every 100 women that own mobile phones, 18 have smartphones. And, for every 100 men that own mobile phones, 13 have a smartphone.
 
 Women taking lead in smart phone ownership. 15.8% of individuals that owned mobile phone indicated that it was a smart phone. A higher proportion of female individuals owned smart phones (18.1%) compared to male individuals (13.4%). #NITS2017
 — NITA-Uganda (@NITAUganda1) March 6, 2018
 
 Yet, one wouldnt expect the trend to be anything close to that. Because another finding says that women find it harder to afford mobile phones. More female individuals indicated that they could not afford a mobile phone (90.5%) compared to male individuals (84.3%), NITA-U tweeted.
 Some other key findings of the survey surrounded affordability and usage.
 
 NITA-U has in the recent past focused its efforts on e-Government services. They believe this is the best way to engage the burgeoning tech-savvy youths.
 “We cannot afford to wait. We have the youngest population in the world and it is growing, E- government [sic] is one of the ways we will ensure efficient and transparent service delivery to an increasingly tech savvy [sic] generation. That is why, NITA-U has set up the e-citizens portal, http://ecitizen.go.ug/, said Dr Fredrick Kitoogo, Director of planning, Research &amp;Development who represented NITA-U’s Executive Director, James Saaka
 While as they have a rough understanding, the efforts seem misguided or insufficient. For example, how many know about the e-government services portal?
 Another critical issue is the dissemination of findings. The starting point would be uploading the reports on NITA-Us website. Something that isnt happening. The last report uploaded was in 2015. Even this recently released survey only has part of the information shared. Which means the media cant afford to disseminate timely or accurate information.
 Plus, there are existing players that have done surveys and studies in this area like GSMA. NITA-U can sub-contract them to ensure the findings are as accurate as they can be and well disseminated.

","Two years ago Aisha Ali Mohamood had no idea how she, alone, could translate her love for children and refugees into actual help. She had no clear strategy to give back.
 But when she called her friends and asked them to volunteer their time, everything started unfolding. With strong faith coupled with a deep belief that she could make a difference, she dug into her little savings and decided to just get started.That is how I Profile Foundation began.
 I Profile Foundation is an organization that seeks to run long term annual projects with primary schools and refugee youth as well as children to promote integration and conflict skills with emphasis on leadership and financial literacy.

 Children from one of the Schools that Partner with I Profile Foundation
 Their programs focus on school children aged between 5-14 years and their training focus on three areas which include legacy, leadership, and etiquette.
 The organization began with a humbling 23, but very, brilliant and talented students. Yet, as you read this, they have been able to reach out to other more 100 students in just under 2 years. These are from four schools that they were able to cover last year.
 Two years ago, I visited a refugee agency in Kampala and my primary school asking to train the children and youth on leadership, etiquette, financial literacy as well as entrepreneurship. Everyone said it was unsustainable. But today, parents report the improved manners of their children. The refugee agency has thanked us too  Aisha Ali
 Currently, Aisha and her team are working on the Koin Dream Challenge. It is an initiative that was started last year and it enables students to be a part of the savings program organized by I Profile Foundation. These students are drawn from the schools they have developed a close relationship with.
 For this very challenge, they have been able to get partnerships with some of the local banks like Bank of Africa. These are aimed at helping them achieve their goal to reach out to many more schools.

 Initially, Aisha had no idea what she was getting herself into. All she had was a passion for helping kids learn financial literacy as well as build future leaders. She was completely an amateur and got to realize that she needed help.
 This has led her to attend a series of seminars and coaching sessions which have been with both personal coaches as well as group training sessions on various aspects of personal development.

"PO8 signs partnership with firm that will lead their $1M investment round
","PO8, an award-winning Bahamian tech company in the marine archaeology space is the latest blockchain entrant to the African continent, looking to scale its operations in underwater artefact recovery powered by distributed ledger technology. Strategically poised to usher in a new area of marine exploration, artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, PO8 is betting big on Africa and its underwater cultural heritage assets to drive sustained and inclusive economic growth to the region.
 Using blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), PO8 monetizes and reshapes the ownership of billions of dollars in sunken treasures and artifacts, converting ownership rights of recovered artifacts with economic value into a smart contract digital title, while keeping recovered items in the custody of the PO8 Museum Foundation to be preserved, studied and exhibited worldwide. With a stored value derived from its underlying asset, NFTs can be sold to anyone around the world.
 Led by Bahamian tech visionary and CEO Matthew Arnett, and co-founder and COO Raul Vasquez, PO8 sees African nations also benefiting from the tokenizing of newly recovered underwater artefacts. “NFTs are a new store of value and commodity class,” shared Arnett during a recent television interview on CNBC Africa’s Closing Bell “Africans from across the continent will have a chance to owe a part of this historical venture, for which they will be the beneficial owners of not just new hi-tech jobs and equity in our museums, but also treasures of the mind. PO8 Cape Town will be first then on to Kenya and Namibia. PO8 is a model that will be duplicated across Africa.”
 Part of PO8’s historic go-to-market strategy for Africa is partnering up with blockchain early adopters through a Security Token Offering or STO, a first in the African region. In South Africa, PO8 recently announced a strategic partnership with Cryptovecs Capital, a Johannesburg based blockchain fund who will lead a $1 million US dollar investment round for PO8’s STO. Cryptovecs Capital CEO, John Lombela said “Africa is always lagging behind when it comes to adoption and technology, but with the advent of the blockchain, we have seen an increasing interest across the continent and in diverse fields. We have identified a great opportunity to partner with PO8 and engage ourselves in a fundraiser that will give an opportunity to not just qualified investors, entrepreneurs, businessmen but allows everyone interested in alternative investment strategies through blockchain to own a piece of PO8, that’s democratization.”
 But the tides are turning as African nations are slowly embracing the blockchain movement for its transparency and decentralization contributions to how we do business in the future. “Africa is no longer the dark continent rather a rising star, stepping up to the moment and making the most of Innovation,” said Yaliwe Soko, Chairwoman of the Blockchain Association of Africa.
 In the Bahamas, PO8’s impact will be felt through the delivery of more local jobs ranging from tech to tourism and protecting the marine habitat. This means hiring divers during the fishing off-season, to creating its first Archeological Treasure and Maritime Museum, pumping an additional $1 billion per annum in economic activity. PO8 will restore any excavated area with artificial and lab-grown reefs, resulting in new ecosystems and marine life habit.
 “New industries like Blockchain can retool professionals from downtrend industries like banking where just this week in South Africa it was announced over 90 Standard Bank branches will close affecting thousands of bank employees risk of losing their jobs. We welcome the opportunity to join arms with local governments to promote sustainability and capacity building in the tech space. Entire populations stand to benefit,” said Vasquez.
 For the past 18 months PO8 has been assembling the Dream Team in marine archaeology and oceanography, with the likes of world-renowned Oceanographer and TITANIC expeditioner, Dr David Gallo; acclaimed Shipwreck researcher and author, Mr. Claudio Bonifacio; Troy Launay, part of the Apollo F-1 engines recovery team funded by Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Evan Kovacs, an authority in underwater imaging who has produced videos for National Geographic and Discovery Channel.
 Recently, PO8 was named a finalist in the SmartDubai Blockchain Challenge from over 700 entries from 79 countries and was also recognized for its blockchain for impact work by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), receiving the 2018 Creative Business Cup Award at Demand Solutions in Santiago, Chile.

"Revised mobile money tax and airtime scratch card ban good for building cashless economy
","On Tuesday this week, the Ugandan Ministry of Finance and cabinet agreed to make revisions on the previously implemented mobile money tax. The revisions included lowering the tax from 1% to 0.5% as well as levying this on withdrawals only.
 
 I am very pleased that @mofpedU &amp; #Cabinet accepted to reduce the tax frm 1% to 0.5% &amp; to Levy it On Withdrawals ONLY, Meaning that If I send MM &amp; transact digitally e.g to pay utility bills, school fees or use my e-wallet to pay for any other service NO tax. #CashlessEconomy https://t.co/a5hB6xTAQZ
 — Frank K Tumwebaze,MP (@FrankTumwebazek) July 17, 2018
 Previously, the said tax was levying a 1% charge for depositing, sending, purchasing and withdrawing money. As long as you were using the mobile money system. This implied that one had no incentive to get rid of cash. Even when they did, there was no incentive to spend that money with mobile.
 However, the recent move by the government has been welcomed by many. Especially those working on solutions that need a cashless economy as an ideal condition to succeed.
 Theres no doubt cash is still the king in Uganda as pointed out by a report released by Jumia earlier this year. But, the mobile money tax was going to make it even impossible for people to throw away their much-loved cash.
 Although the new tax doesnt offer an incentive to export cash into the mobile money system, at least it doesnt penalize one for using mobile money to transact. In fact, one converts their cash into mobile money, it penalizes you for wanting to turn it into cash again.

 As Frank Tumwebaze noted, if you send MM [Mobile Money] &amp; transact digitally e.g to pay utility bills, school fees or use my e-wallet to pay for any other service [theres] NO tax.
 Allan Rwakatungu, the co-founder of Xente  one of the startups that would relish a cashless economy  wrote that: This is much better and forward thinking. When we encourage a cashless economy we shall broaden our tax base. I am happy about this.
 Also read: These are the Ugandan startups in Hangzhou participating in Alibaba’s eFounders Initiative
 At the beginning of this year, MTN Uganda started a campaign aimed at getting people to start using mobile money for making payments. What they essentially did was subsidize anyone who used mobile money instead of cash.
 For example, I bought a movie ticket for UGx. 5000 less than I would if I had used cash. Such incentives were making it easier and cheaper to transact using mobile money rather than cash.
 Also read: Has MTN pulled the plug on the MTN App challenge?
 Yet, the government had thrown them out of the window in an overnight.
 Additionally, the recent ban on the use of airtime scratchcards will also give a boost to using mobile money for transactions.
 This is because airtime is a something used widely in Uganda. Therefore, forcing all to buy airtime using mobile money is a great step towards preparing them to make payments for other things using mobile money.
 As it has been, most people have been using mobile money for sending and receiving. In some cases, payment for utility bills has been another popular use case for the mobile money.
 However, to achieve a cashless economy, we need merchants and retail shops to start accepting cashless transactions. Thats when we shall achieve mass adoption of such solutions. And I believe these are great strides towards that.

"With over $38M raised last year, Egypt&#8217;s Swvl expands to Kenya
","Last year saw Africas early stage and technology companies raise over $686.4 million in total funding, according to the Digest Africa Index. Egypt, with $68 million, was among the top five most funded countries. But, the most significant chunk of that came from bus-sharing startup  Swvl, which is estimated to have raised over $38 million through two different funding rounds. Now, it seems that it is the right time for them to start deploying the cash.
 Towards the end of 2018, Swvls co-founder and CEO, Mustafa Kandil, told Almal News some of their expansion plans. He pointed out that they were looking to expand to 10 cities outside Egypt in 2019, beginning with the Philippine capital of Manila and including Nairobi, Dakar, and Jakarta.
 According to Swvls info and ads section on Facebook, they have started running Nairobi-focused adverts. The six ads run so far are an indicator that the startup might have decided to expand to Nairobi before the other earlier planned cities.
 In the ads, Swvl  which runs a mass-transit bus-sharing service  points out that they already have more than 80 [bus] stations and five main lines [that] are just one tap away.
 One of the adverts that Swvl is running.
 Swvl is among the pioneers of bus-sharing services in the world. Last year saw competition in this particular segment stiffen after Careem  one of its early backers  decided to launch its service.
 In July 2017, Careem  MENAs most prominent rival to Uber  participated in Swvls $500,000 seed round. However, Almal News reported that they exited the startup after they conceived plans of running a similar service. They have since then launched it in Egypt  Swvls home market  and planned to scale it to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
 Uber also launched its first bus-sharing service in Egypt last year. Dara Khosrowshahi, Ubers CEO  who attended the launch event in Cairo  added that they had plans to invest more than $100 million into the country. The company also hinted on plans to introduce the bus-sharing service to Nairobi, though Swvl seems to have beaten them to that market, too.
 Egypt has given birth to a couple of interesting segment-focused ride-hailing startups in the recent past. For example, Halan, which raised $4.3 million in a Series A last year, is only focused on the tuk-tuks, while Buseet  which raised $250,000 from 500 Startups last year  describes itself as a network of modern shuttles on fixed repeat routes every day.

 It should also be noted that KPIs that must be kept track of vary from startup to startup depending on the set goals and industry. Though some remain constant for tech startups as theyre looked at as a way of laying the business foundation.
 So, in terms of KPI’s for Uganda’s tech startups, the following should be watched as recommend by TMS Ruge, a co-founder at Hive Colab and Useremit.
 1. Customer Acquisition
 The number one KPI that Ruge advises any tech startup to keep track of is the user or customer adoption in micro measurements.
 Our market is so small, be glad you can measure your customers one by one on a daily basis, Ruge added.
 This should be able to help you understand their behavior and patterns  which is crucial when trying to understand whether youre attracting the right customers or not.
 2. Customer feedback
 Ideally, youre developing a product for your end users. It wouldnt, therefore, make sense at all if what you highly rate is worthless to them.
 Keep track of the number of satisfied customers vs those unsatisfied. Successful attention to this detail will help in retaining customers you are tracking in #1, Ruge says.
 If a customer is satisfied with the product or service, engage them to find out what exactly they like thats making them come back.
 Still, if they dont like your product, engage them and find out what would make them use it.

 3. Revenue growth
 With little or no alternative sources of funding for your Ugandan startup, it is only logical that the sooner you start generating revenue, the better. Yet, Ruge says the revenue metric is not as easy as one may think.
 This is a metric that is quite tricky in our tiny market, but it can be done. If Fenix International can figure out a way to generate $20 million in sales from village people wanting clean energy, you can figure out how to monetize an urban customer base, Ruge says.
 He also adds that If you can’t do this then throw out your business model and start over. Because, as he concluded, if you can’t do this, you won’t get funded.
 4. MAU
 This stands for Monthly Active Users. It can be measured interchangeably with revenue growth as Ruge points out below;
 If your business model is foregoing revenues in exchange for the growth of users, then this becomes an extremely useful metric to track.
 5. Profitability
 Lastly, your startup should be able to measure profitability if it is able to figure out the top four.

"Meet Manuela Pacutho: The Founder of The Cradle and a 2017 Mandela Washington Fellow
","Manuela Pacutho is the founder of The Cradle, a 24hr infant care centre. She was also among the 25 young African leaders to attend this years Mandela Washington Fellowship.
 The Mandela Washington Fellowship is a program of the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) that empowers young people through academic coursework, leadership training, and networking. The program kicked off in 2014 and has since then been taking on more and more young African leaders.
 In a conversation with Manuela Pacutho, we were able to delve into the details of The Cradle, what she learned from the fellowship and how she plans on using it to improve her business, The Cradle.

 Mandela Washington Fellowship
 When asked about how the program went in general, she says it opened my eyes to what is happening in Africa and Uganda, to be more specific. This was in respect to the child care industry.
 Before leaving, I wanted to find out why the children in Uganda are different from those in America in terms of thinking, she added.
 Secondly Manuela wanted to find out how to run the kind of business like The Cradle, more efficiently because no one else has it in Uganda. Basically, infant care centers are for children under the age of three  before they can go to school. Which is different from what Day care centres do.
 Between Inspire Africa and Mandela Washington Fellowship
 Manuela was one of the participants in the Inspire Africa competition. A competition that gave birth to the likes of Dr. Davis Musinguzi. To her, participation in Inspire Africa was, as she put it, an experiential venture. Though she was also anticipating seed capital from the Inspire Africa.
 Immediately after Inspire Africa, she was able to launch Little steps which later morphed into The Cradle. The name change was due to the fact that most people thought it was a kindergarten. She believes the new name, reflects the line of business.

 Market Potential
 One of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs face is lack of an actual-addressable market out of the usually perceived huge market  This was a topic of interest as I wanted to find out if child care services have a significant addressable market.
 You know the average age in Uganda is 15.5 years old and the statistics also show that around 80% of the population is under the age of 30 years, she points out. She further continues that, over 70% are below the age of 15 years.

 To her, in 10 years, the number thatll be having children will be over triple the current At this point, she pauses a question, whats going to happen to those children?
 To further ensure I understood the point, she launched into a quick explanation.
 You find that the girls who have been working as house girls in our homes are now in Universal Primary Education or Universal Secondary Education, Manuela.
 She continues to say that therell not be any maids anymore. The ones that youll get are those that couldnt even afford to go to Universal Education.
 Reception of the idea
 The reception hasnt been easy, given that most people are used to the kindergarten concept. She says only a few parents understand the value of ensuring their child under the age of 3 is brought up the right way.
 Most of the parents with us understand the impact of a child caregiver when they are under the age of three. They actually talk to us on how we can improve our services, Manuela adds.
 However, she continues to say that the situation is because we havent reached a stage where this is an option. In her opinion, most parents that should be considered the cradle currently have other ready options like a housemaid or a relative from the village.
 It is those parents who have understood the impact of what it means to have the right care for your child in the first three years of their life that have so far welcomed the idea, she added.
 Partnerships and Marketing Strategies
 One of the best ways for a startup on a lean budget to acquire customers is low-budget awareness campaigns and partnerships with key players in similar areas of interest.
 Currently, they are focusing on training and workshops. Actually, they have scheduled their very first workshop on the 21st of October at Kampala Parents School. Here, they expect Churches, Schools, Kindergartens, Parents, and anyone in contact with children under three years.
 When it comes to marketing, they mainly rely on word of mouth as well as social media.
 We are yet to get into traditional marketing means because we are still a small business, so we cant afford it, Manuela says. She also adds that theyre ensuring they take part in most exhibitions involving children

 Accelerator Programs
 Due to a lack of mentors in most of the African startup ecosystems, accelerator and fellowship programs have become the only oasis.
 In case you have no idea of accelerator programs, from this Harvard Business Review, they support early-stage, growth-driven companies through education, mentorship, and financing.
 Mandela Washington Fellowship was her first program. Though not an accelerator, it offered priceless leadership mentor-ship.
 But, Manuela says, I would love to [attend an accelerator program] because our education system doesnt allow us to go through what it provides.
 By the time you come into creating a business, it is your first time and youre making lots of mistakes. If someone can help, I would find it easier because it would be a wonderful opportunity to make sure that my business can survive, she added.
 However, she wouldnt advise one to become a prostitute of attending programs.
 One should only attend an accelerator program if it will help achieve a specific, she advises.
 Otherwise, she questions, [if all youre doing is attend the programs], then when are you implementing whatever you learn?.
 The 2017 Mandela Washington Fellows
 Capital 
 Lastly, we talked about an issue that most if not all youths starting a business rank high on the list of hurdles  Capital.
 So far, Manuela has used personal savings and a grant of $5,000 from Amos Wekesa. She expected a grant of $5,000 from her participation in Inspire Africa, but it has never got to her.
 Also read: Meet Aisha Ali, the Founder of I Profile Foundation
 An occurrence she describes as sad. She continues to say, youd imagine that after [one] going through Inspire Africa, where theyre looking for seed capital, and the money is never given to them even when it has been sent to the grant supervisors  it is sad.
 When asked if shes currently looking for external investment, she said yes and the amount is in the region of USD 1,000,000.
 Currently, I am okay with either a grant or Venture Capital. Because I have worked out a way that I can be able to work with either. My only target is to open into organizations and more child care centers around the country, she said.

"Africa&#8217;s Talking is expanding to 6 African countries at once
","It is normal for a startup to embark on rapid scaling immediately after raising funding. That unfounded rule is applying to Kenyas API platform, Africas Talking, that recently raised around $8.6 Million.
 The company has been operating in 6 African countries; Kenya, Uganda (recently expanded), Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, and Rwanda.
 However, when they closed the recent round of funding, expansion became top of their radar. The company stated that they were looking at 20 African countries by close of 2019.
 Last week, I learned that the company is now looking to move into 6 African countries at once with much of the emphasis placed on West African countries.

 I dont think Im at the liberty to disclose which ones these are or how far we have gotten to getting them up and running, she wrote.
 However, from an individual that I believe is very familiar with the matter, the company is finalizing the incorporation process and hiring in The Gambia and Ivory Coast.
 The other countries that the company is eyeing  according to that person  are Botswana, Ethiopia, and Senegal.

 Usually, the company has always started operations with around two people in every new market they go to. For example, to set up the Ugandan office, they hired Norma Atamba and Nicholas Kamanzi. Who were the only employees until early this year.
 Previously, whenever we set up a presence in a new country, we would hire at least two people to get it up and running, Sally wrote.
 However, according to Sally, they are not sure how many people theyll now hire per country. Because they are in new territories.
 We are a bit more intentional with expansion and working with different models to experiment with and one of the variables is how many people to hire, she wrote. Adding that currently, the definite answer to how whether they will continue with hiring two people per country is no.
 Africas Talking interest in West Africa  especially Francophone  must be heavily influenced by telecom company Orange. Not only was the company an investor in Africas Talkings last round, it is the leading teleco in those markets.
 Related: Andela must be expanding to Egypt with this recent job announcement
 A market which can seem a bit foreign to Africas Talking as Sally said. Hence the need for them as expansion partners.

 Partnering with them on this will help us navigate this markets wisely and be the best infrastructure partner for developers in this countries.

"Top 4 Challenges Ugandan fintech startups face
","Fin-tech startups are primarily finance companies that are embracing modern technology in order to solve problems and provide a more inclusive service while making profit. Uganda has a number of startups in this category that have dared take on the challenge. It has even been predicted that funding towards African fintech startups will keep increasing significantly each year.
 But this is no walk in the garden  there are a lot of hoops to jump through and new challenges to overcome every step of the way. Today, we try to delve into some of these challenges and suggest solutions to some.
 
 Trust
 
 Trust is a hard commodity to come by in any business. It is even harder for fin-tech startups because they are primarily involved with money. Earning the trust of people is a long journey that requires patience but only if you have a great product, are consistent and committed to the long term. Even when you have checked all these boxes, you still have to address yet another form of mistrust that comes from Ugandans inability to use products developed by their own because of a predisposition that they are not secure or up to the task.
 
 Fin-tech is about handling peoples money and when it comes to money, people take time to trust you.   Ivan Mworozi, co-Founder: Akiba
 
 Ivan Mworoza, co-founder of Akiba had an idea for mitigating this challenge. He suggested that fintech startup founders in Uganda should focus on securing reputable partnerships.
 Therefore, startups in the fintech field should ensure they craft partnerships thatll help them establish credibility which quickly converts to trust among the user-base. Some of the partnerships might be with Telecoms or banks. This is no easy task. If it was though, everyone would do it.
 2. Greedy Investors
 There hasnt been so much external investor attention for Ugandan fintech startups. This means the startups have to dwell on the local investment. Now, we all know that the investment climate in Uganda is still virgin and the few who give it a try, make sure they de-risk their investment as much as they can.
 In the words of Ivan Mugere, a former Tony Elumelu Fellow and founder of Poketi.net, local investors want to take more than they invest. In otherwards, the deal is usually one-sided. This quickly demotivates the startup founders who feel, at the end of the day, that theyre simply working for the investor.
 Our advice here is simple; Startup founders should make sure they make as many consultations with people who have been in a similar situation as them before. They should also do a quick background check on the investment record of the individual or company that would like to invest in them. This will enable them make the best decision.
 3. Small market size
 For most startups, the bigger the market size one can gain access to, the more likely one is to succeed. This is one of the reasons Nigerian startups have an edge over other those in other African countries. Numbers.
 With a population of over 180 million, Nigerian startups stand a much better chance of getting a good share of their potential target user-base that would keep them profitable. The odds are different for a country like Uganda that is nearly 5 times smaller.
 Just imagine having a potential userbase of over 170 Million at your disposal compared to less than 40 Million? Even scaling a startup outside Uganda proves to be costly. One would talk of the East African community but its benefits still remain on paper. One would have to incur costs for each market they opt to enter. Lets say you would like to operate in Rwanda, Kenya or Tanzania, youd have to register in each of the countries.
 This could be one of the reasons investors in Ugandan startups try as much as possible to derisk their investment. One of the solutions to this strategizing by considering the model which Israel startups employ. Identify a need in a big organization and build a solution for that specific need, then position yourself for acquistion. Here, your solution doesnt have to be limited to the Ugandan market, it can scale as far as you wish.
 4. Finances
 The 2016 startup funding report by Disrupt Africa revealed that South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria were the top three destinations for tech investors in 2016, both in terms of numbers of deals and total amount of funding. The song of lack or insufficient funding for Ugandan fintech startups has been sung for now over 5 years but there seems to be much changing.
 A few startups, like Poketi.net, have had access to both local and regional investment. But where does that leave the majority of others? The solution to this urgent issue still remains a mystery. Though one would advise Ugandan fintech startup founders to start networking outside their circles and areas of comfort.
 Theres a saying that if you want to catch fish, you go where the fish is. Now is the time for fintech startup founders to look at the world beyond Uganda and hence spread their wings.
 There are many more challenges but we feel these are more pressing. In case you think theres one or two challenges we left out, leave them in the comments.

"INTERVIEW: This Fitness Startup, Elite Fitness, is franchising gyms in Uganda
","Elite Fitness, a fitness and health startup, wants to help more Ugandans with fitness and health problems through running a country and later continent-wide chain of fitness gyms.
 How are they planning to do so? They enter into a partnership with a property owner, set up and run a gym with the same standards as their other run gyms  basically, the way any franchise you know works. Think Chicken Tonight, KFC, Mr. Tasty and all in the same category. This, they are looking to replicate across Uganda.
 The whole idea of going into fitness seems to be good after all. With the growing buzz about the rising middle income in Uganda and Africa, theres no doubt interest in fitness and healthy lifestyle has spiraled overtime. The interest has also been fanned by the need to match up what the western world media has defined as the trendy and ideal lifestyle.
 We caught up with Assey Kiwanuka, a co-founder of Elite Fitness, for more details about Elite Fitness.
 Startup Digest Africa: Whats Elite Fitness? 
 Assey Kiwanuka: Elite Fitness is Uganda’s premier International chain of fitness centers featuring personalized transformation plans, state of the art equipment, certified personal trainers, a diverse group exercise program and a supportive, motivating environment.
 Currently, Elite Fitness delivers the most dynamic fitness experience in the industry. Our experience also includes Elite’s STUDIO. This gives members access to boutique-style classes all under the same roof.
 More than a mere gym, it combines coaching and a community. Between the people running it, we have a combined 15 years of fitness expertise to help people around the African Continent achieve their potential through fitness.
 SDA: Why did you come up with it?
 AK: The current health club business models in Africa have a crucial gap. They do not encompass medical science and consumer experience. Hence losing out on the bigger picture of what really makes a good health club.
 The Elite Fitness franchise model is filling that gap. The trend that we are setting up is not just about Fitness, but also a broader spectrum of physical activity and wellness encompassing healthy living, sports, and health for not only the body but also the mind.
 SDA: Ever since you started, what are some of the successes the business has had to date?
 AK: Our premier health club partner has been Marcos Gym &amp; Spa located in Namugongo near Quality Mall. Its a unique growth story. We have also recently signed up 5 new franchisees whose rollout is scheduled for January 2018.
 I would say that we are experiencing tremendous growth in terms of consumer numbers and franchisee numbers. This has actually kept us ahead of our growth projections.
 SDA: What kind of clients do you focus on?
 AK: We look at clients in two angles; thats investors and the consumer themselves. For the investors, the ideal for Elite Fitness franchise owners has a passion for the fitness industry. They should also be people looking for an outstanding investment opportunity that would benefit themselves and their families.
 On the side of consumers, I would say that our focus is on health-conscious and fitness-minded people. Adults and, or,  their children looking for an all-inclusive lifestyle change that is in-tune with current events and changes in nutrition and exercise science. We have these ranging from the top athletes in town to people who have been living a sedentary lifestyle.
 SDA: While doing all this, have you brought in any form of external funding? if yes, then how much is it?
 AK: Actually, we have not sourced any external funding yet. Thats if youre asking in terms of loans or grants or equity investment. Though, we plan to do so during this month of December. The main objective of raising the external funds will be to set up our company-owned Health Clubs. Currently, we hold full P&amp;L [Profit and Loss] responsibilities for health club investments exceeding USD$500K in value.
 SDA: It must be quite challenging self-financing it. But, what are the other challenges involved in running a business like yours in Uganda?
 AK: First and foremost, there is the challenge of manpower. One of the biggest challenges in the fitness industry today in Uganda is finding certified trainers, nutritionists, and other certified fitness staff.
 Part of this challenge comes from how the fitness industry has evolved in Uganda. For years, a gym instructor has been just a bodybuilder of ripped muscle or someone who can make people sweat and tire during an aerobics session.
 Not anymore. Now, more than ever, fitness consumers expect hands-on help to achieve the results they want. They need professionals who know how to coach them to long-term behavior change, healthier eating habits and regular physical activity.
 Actually, one solution we have adapted to the above problem is sponsoring talent by sending them to Nairobi for a 6 Months foundation program. They are then accessed and certified by the American Council of Exercise. Though we are also in the process of establishing a fully-fledged Fitness academy too. It will offer a range of NCCA-accredited programs for persona; trainers, group fitness instructors, health coaches and medical exercise specialists.
 Our staffing plan is based on empowering street children and orphans to take up fitness related jobs and grow them into professional fitness practitioners all the way to managerial level.
 SDA: Aside from the challenges, what are the positive lessons you have learned from this experience?
 AK: I have learned that your team is everything: You cant get far with your startup without a fantastic group of people with you along the journey. One needs to also let their employees grow into positions while providing them with guidance and accountability. When it comes to hiring, do it slowly and fire fast. I have learned to pay close attention to what makes each person tick.
 Assey and his co-founder Godfrey Kakembo
 Another important lesson is that starting a business can be full of heartaches. Running a startup is very tough. Dont underestimate the need to hit streets and knock on doors. You need to be ready and willing to work long hours. Stay humble. Be patient.
 SDA: Now, what do you think is the future of Elite Fitness? Maybe 5 Years from today.
 AK: Our objective is to make people better versions of themselves. Whether they aspire to be professional athletes or lose a few kilograms. We, therefore, plan on growing as fast as possible in of new locations to serve as many people as possible. The expansion is going to be both local and international. We project a strong and exceedingly profitable footprint in emerging markets across the African continent in the coming 5 years.
 SDA: Well, thats incredible. However, achieving what you have stated above requires one to have partnered with others. Have you already signed any key partnerships yet?
 AK: Oh year. We have a couple of partnerships. We are proud to work with a number of strategic partners to meet our objectives. Each one has been selected as they are best in class and collaborate extensively to make our facilities what they are. So far, we have AAR, ICEA insurance, Technogym, Life Fitness, and Precor.
 SDA: We are coming to the end. But I would like to find out if there is any other key information people should know about Elite Fitness?
 AK: Elite Fitness considers innovativeness and uniqueness as its value-generating aspects. Our workout methodology is rather a new form of fitness programming in East Africa, its value proposition being absolutely the newness, as a great deal of the fitness trends come and go. It is evolving in nature.

"Online Marketplace For African Fashion &#038; Art Secures €500k Seed Round
","In 2016, the African Development Bank (AfDB) estimated that the continents fashion industry could be worth $15.5bn over the next five years leading to 2021. The estimation was supported by the growing interest in African fashion, art and music across the globe.
 Some of the reasons for the sudden growth in interest in the continents fashion include; the internet and social media which have given great exposure to African culture. Additionally, music genres like Afrobeats and other celebrities from across the world have embraced the continents fashion which they have incorporated in their lifestyles.
 Yet, despite the surge in the interest, theres no central marketplace where one can buy or sell African fashion.
 Afrikrea.com, a fashion startup based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast (initially in Paris) has set out to bridge the gap providing a platform that one can use to discover, buy and sell Made Of Africa fashion, art and crafts from all over the world.
 Today, the startup has announced raising a €500,000 (~ $565,000) Seed Round that it believes will help them consolidate their position in the market as well as fuel further growth. The investment round was led by Mauritius-based pre-seed and seed investor, Saviu Ventures  a micro-VC that writes tickets ranging from $100k to $800k.
 Saviu Ventures joined the initial renowned investors like the Thierry Petit and David Dayan of Showroomprive.com (France 2nd largest fashion and beauty ecommerce) or Hervé Cuvilliez of Id4 Ventures, among others. According to Arthur Thuet, a co-founder at Saviu Ventures, the deal closed on January 10, 2019.

"Agency banking is finally here, and here is how the banks can make the best of the opportunity
","The Amendment of the Financial Institutions Act by parliament has paved way for the introduction of Agency Banking. Agency banking, in its simplest form, is where a licensed financial institution engages an agent to provide special financial services on their behalf outside the conventional avenues of tellers, cashiers and ATMs.
 These services may range from deposits, withdrawals and savings. Going by this definition, it is very clear that Agency Banking has been with us since the advent of the mobile money agent when MTN Ugandan first introduced the service in 2009. With mobile money, a customer can engage an agent to deposit money into their account, withdraw and send money, pay bills as well as access other financial services like credit.
 The success of this form of this phenomenon has got Banks drooling, and they now want a piece of the action and justifiably so.
 The numbers are jaw-dropping by any comparison; Over 19 million mobile money subscribers from a mere 10,000 in a space of fewer than 10 years, since 2009. Which amounts to over 53 percent of the Ugandan population.
 In comparison, the percentage of the banked population was around 18-21 percent according to the Bank of Uganda Status of Financial Inclusion in Uganda Report in 2014. When it comes transactions, mobile money is king.
 
 
 The amount of money transacted through the mobile money was over UGX. 32 trillion (USD 8.9 billion) in 2015. In comparison, the total assets of Stanbic Bank Uganda  the largest bank, were estimated at UGX. 4.5 trillion (USD 1.3 billion) by June 2016.
 
 
 The business case for banks to join the party is very clear, join the party or die to put it simply.
 The battle has been won by the telecoms, so far. But, the war has not been lost by the Banks yet. The arrival of Agency Banking gives the banks another opportunity to redeem themselves.
 When you look under covers, you see that Telecoms  despite their success  have not done much in terms of innovation around the product they have all copied from Safaricom, in Kenya. It was a complete cut and paste! This is where the opportunity for Banks is.
 Banks, unlike Telecoms  who are experts in telecommunication  have the longest experience providing tailored financial services to customers. Therefore, all banks need is to capitalize on this experience and tailor products suitable to the financially excluded.
 
 From the same author: Blockchain technology could be Ugandan banks’ answer to mobile money
 
 It was not until Commercial Bank of Africa, CBA, came along from Kenya that MTN Uganda was able to introduce consumer loans accessible to their customers over their phones. Up until this point, there was little done to evolve the service since it was introduced in Uganda.
 It is not going to be clear-sailing, however, for the banks whose resumes do not portray innovation. Providing financial services to the poor is no trivial task.
 Banks cannot afford to copy Agency Banking as applied to other countries like Kenya, where Agency Banking has been largely a success. Over 50,000 mobile money agents are already offering deposit, withdrawals, transfers and other payments services.
 It would be short-sighted and a missed opportunity for banks to follow the same path the telecoms took of “copy and paste” from Kenya.  The demographic group targeted by Agency banking in Uganda is largely the bottom of the pyramid, and they have quite unique challenges.
 If agency banking, in general, is to be successful and be profitable to the players, a more innovative approach is required.
 Let us examine three of the top issues that need to be addressed during implementation.
 The first is the proximity of the agents. Customers need the agents to be close to them to provide convenience for access to financial services. The second challenge which banks do not perform particularly well is customer relationship management. The third is tailoring suitable financial products for the target demography.
 A study by Steadman Group in Kenya 2007 indicated that banks, though for long believed to be the main sources of credit to Kenyans, ranked third with Savings and Credit Societies (SACCOs) coming second.
 Who came in first? The study showed that the ubiquitous shopkeeper found in every estate, village and even footpath is the most frequent source of soft loans as well as goods on credit and that the majority of Kenyans turn to him/her frequently.
 This analogy is live widespread in Uganda as well. If the banks want to topple this “king of credit” in the villages, they need to seriously incorporate the characteristics of this shopkeeper in their product proposition or they are in for some serious competition.
 This shopkeeper is next door to the borrower and therefore offers the best proximity. The shopkeeper being part of the community knows the borrowers home, family and garden, or workplace and therefore can offer unmatched KYC and customer relationship.
 Lastly, the borrower regularly needs salt, kerosene, sugar, food and other household items, which the shopkeeper has in his shop. The shopkeeper in this situation is offering razor-sharp credit facility in exactly the need and amount when and as needed. To banks, this is a dream albeit an achievable one.
 So what are some ways to achieve this?
 If there is one thing we have learnt from the disruptive inventions in the tech world, it is their ability to study in and out their customer preferences and behaviours. Banks can borrow a leaf here.
 For instance, using the shopkeeper example, one of the most natural agents for agency banking should be that shopkeeper. Instead of some agent in the kiosk by the roadside as many financial institutions are already thinking.
 Secondly, it is not a secret that 80 percent of the Ugandan community is engaged in some form of agricultural or related income generating activity. The financial services should, therefore, be tailored to the demography. Leasing facilities for purchasing farm equipment, credit lines for purchasing fertilizers, insurance for loss of products due to unpredictable weather patterns.
 These products should be the equivalent of business loans. For personal loans, credit services for food, health care, school fees, and believe it or not alcohol consumption. This is the innovation that will drive agency banking to a success and further build on the large gains brought by mobile money.

"South Africa&#8217;s Coindirect Raises €1m Seed Round Led By Concentric
","Coindirect, the global cryptocurrency platform, has raised €1m in an investment round led by Concentric, with participation from Blockchain.com, and MakerDAO. The end-to-end cryptocurrency platform, founded by Donald Jackson, Jesse Hemson-Struthers, Nicholas Haralambous and Stephen Young, is one of the first of its kind to enable customers to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum using their own local currency in the emerging markets.
 Coindirect was founded on the belief that cryptocurrency is the enabling tool that will change the way people engage with and use money. Realising that emerging markets have largely been ignored by existing cryptocurrency services, the founders set out to bring widespread cryptocurrency adoption to people in these regions, which they believe can benefit the most from its decentralised approach to finance.
 The four founders bring diverse entrepreneurial and institutional experience to the business. Hemson-Struthers, Jackson and Haralambous have all built and sold multiple businesses in South Africa and Africa in industries including mobile technology, social networks and the regulated gaming industry. Young has a financial and software development background and spent nine years at Allan Gray Asset Management.
 The Coindirect platform allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency using traditional local fiat currency wherever they are using their mobile device or desktop browser. It supports over 40 different cryptocurrencies at present, which is the largest offering in Africa.
 Coindirect has proven its offering in the South African market, where it has acquired 40,000 registered users. The Coindirect iOS and Android apps are available for download and can be used anywhere in the world. The platform also caters for data-sensitive users in markets where data costs are high and coverage can be limited.
 With the help of the latest round of funding, Coindirect plans to further expand across Africa and Europe, supported by partnerships with Blockchain.com, MakerDAO and others being announced in the coming months. The business is particularly focused on bringing cryptocurrency to emerging markets, with growing demand for alternative ways of banking and engaging with money in these regions. The team believes the lull in the crypto markets provides an ideal opportunity to build the infrastructure for widespread adoption.
 Nic Haralambous, COO, Coindirect, commented: “Coindirect is on a mission to change money by building a bridge between the decentralised world of crypto and the centralised world of traditional finance. Our goal is for everybody, from a first-time buyer to a pro-investor, to easily and securely be able to buy, sell, trade and track their assets in one place. This round of funding and the key partners we have on board take us a step closer to our objective of achieving mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in Africa and across the globe.”
 Alexander Mann, Investor at Concentric, commented:
 “Coindirect is tapping into a genuine use case for cryptocurrencies – and Bitcoin’s original purpose – which is to give citizens in countries with poor governance a chance of financial freedom. The business is in a fantastic position to expand its distribution across Africa and internationally, thanks to a stellar team with extensive entrepreneurial experience, and an understanding of how to scale early-stage ventures. With few sophisticated competitors currently challenging in this market, we’re excited to see what the future holds for the business.”
 “Maker believes the blockchain has the power to create an inclusive platform for economic empowerment,” said Rune Christensen, CEO and co-founder of MakerDAO. “Working with Coindirect to help people purchase and trade cryptocurrencies with their local currency is one step closer to providing people around the world with equal access to the global financial marketplace.”
 Samuel Harrison, the Managing Partner at Blockchain.com, commented:
 “At Blockchain, we’re committed to advancing the crypto ecosystem and providing consumers with financial utility beyond speculation. We believe the emerging markets use case for blockchain technology is compelling for both payments and also as a store of value. This is particularly true in regions with less developed payments infrastructure, high inflation, and restricted access to traditional banking services. We’re thrilled to work with Coindirect with the mission of bringing crypto to the hands of the consumer”

"Can a Smartphone Transform the Life of a Woman Micro-Entrepreneur?
","It is no secret that Africa is mobile. Therefore, anything aimed at the masses in this booming continent is likely to take the digital route if it’s to be at all successful.
 When starting Kiteka, Hephzi Pemberton and Bethy Isingoma had this in mind. Kiteka is the first all-female, all mobile digital outsourcing network whose main aim is to enable women in Uganda and beyond to access the global digital economy by providing smartphone technology, training, and connections to international businesses in need of intelligent digital outsourcing.
 
 Kiteka Launch Event
 Research has shown that owning a smartphone increases income for over half of female entrepreneurs in low and middle-income countries. Yet in Sub-Saharan Africa, women are 23% less likely than men to own a mobile phone  and 64% of women dont own a phone at all. Kiteka is here to address the imbalance, Hephzi points out.
 On that basis, Hephzi and Bethy decided to start Kiteka. Put simply, Kiteka provides smartphones to the ladies with no down payment and interest-free. Then, they’re required to pay a monthly fee until the cost of the phone is covered.
 Alongside the loans, the women receive specialized training from the Kiteka team which covers technology as well as general business operations. These training come free of charge as long as one subscribes to the program.

 Currently, they have 72 women on board and the number is growing by around 10 women per month. What is interesting is that, according to Hephzi, women who are using these phones are reporting an improvement in their daily sales.
 This has been achieved through the constant contact with their clients and being able to offer additional services through the smartphone, such as mobile money. It has also been through the training on how to run their business finances more efficiently.
 The challenge, however, is the high prices for internet. This, as expected, further hinders the women’s learning given that some of the training material can only be accessed through Udemy and YouTube.
 But, according to Hephzi, they’re looking for a way to get around this by partnering with local hubs that could have stable and cheaper internet to allow the women to visit more often.
 Ladies attending a training program
 Though based in London, Hephzi ensures that everything runs very well through her on-ground partner, Bethy, who is based in Kampala. Asked how they get the women on board, Hephzi said that they employ a couple of strategies.
 But some of the most common include going to church networks as well as local markets. Bethy, who is on the ground, goes out and speaks to those that might be interested.
 The bigger picture is to create a digital outsourcing network for startups in the UK. Here, according to Hephzi, “some of the women can then start to do work thats coming from businesses here in the UK that needs outsourcing”.
 Thats the business that they’re looking at growing and they think it will help them work with more women. Their current vision is to work with 1000 women in 5 years.
 Considering the kind of women Kiteka is bringing on board, one wonders if they shall be able to handle remote and tech work. However, Hephzi believes that with the right training, they should be in a position to do this.
 She also adds that “the work will be basic digital tasks. For example, data labeling and data cleaning work from startups that requires several hours of manual processing. It could be as simple as labeling an image with certain items or features, or more complex tasks like listening to different sound files and identifying differences”.
 
 Kiteka Trailer 2017
 The admission criteria for Kiteka that a woman needs to run her own business for at least a year. They also don’t admit anyone below 18 years. The last qualification is for good written and spoken English in order to be able to work on the digital outsourcing side.

"What NSSF amendments mean to the startup ecosystem in Uganda
","Plans are afoot for proposed changes to the NSSF Act. The document, a copy of which has been making rounds on social media, states proposed changes to the National Social Securities Fund (NSSF) Act Cap 222.
 This is to be done through a National Social Security Fund Amendment Bill 2018 tabled in Parliament.
 While the process for bringing the proposed amendments into law has to be followed, it is widely expected that the amendments to the NSSF Act will pass to calm agitation and push for liberalization of the pension sector through the Retirement Benefits Sector Liberalisation Bill 2011 currently before Parliament.
 Though there are many amendments proposed, we focus below on those that are of most concern to the startup and early-stage ecosystem in Uganda. These include:
 
 The mandatory contribution of all workers regardless of the size of their enterprise.
 To amend the Act to provide that an employer who fails or refuses to remit contributions within the prescribed time may have the business managed by a third party.
 Persons over the age of 60 years will not pay tax on their benefits
 
 Mandatory contribution, regardless of the organizations size, will increase available investable funds for NSSF, even faster. Currently, the NSSF fund size is UGX 7.9 trillion (USD 2+ billion).
 According to UBOS, the range of wages in Uganda is between UGX 430,000 to UGX 1,770,000 for low skilled and high skilled employees. This is against an employed population of approximately 8 million people.
 Also read: How to use blockchain technology to unlock real estate potential in Uganda
 Even at a salary of UGX 400,000, over UGX 480 billion in monthly collections can be realized. By taking a 15% pension contribution.
 Additionally, stipulating that persons over the age of 60 will not pay tax on their benefits should also encourage savings for longer.
 This, combined with increased allocations and fund size which will be seeking investment opportunities reinforces the case for investing in early/mid-stage businesses via vehicles (VC funds, PE funds).
 NSSF has invested in a Private Equity fund to date targeted to SMEs in the Agribusinesses space. It is thus conceivable that they can invest in a Venture Capital fund targeted to local early-stage businesses.
 But, it is also worth noting that this increased pool of funds for investment will come at an expense. Especially for early-stage businesses.
 The proposal to make contributions mandatory for all workers regardless of enterprise size will lead to increased costs to do business through the NSSF obligations. Especially, seeing as the majority of Ugandan businesses are micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Most of which are operating informally.
 As the organisations charged with overseeing the processes for registration and compliance with business operating rules in Uganda, including URSB, URA, Local Municipalities (KCCA, Wakiso, etc.) and NIRA are becoming more integrated, these costs of operating a business will be inescapable and easily enforceable.
 They will then mean more barriers to starting a business in Uganda. As well as increased costs of running it. Especially for early-stage companies.
 This may slow down growth as early-stage businesses try to optimize the already scarce resources. In turn, it might lead to a need for extra capital requirements within the ecosystem to shore up costs and remain compliant.
 Uganda already has an existent and growing informal economy. To combat the need to follow NSSF, I predict a spur in the existing gig economy  aka informal employment. The amendment will further it as employers, especially early-stage businesses, try to navigate costs and labour laws.
 Although, this should also present an opportunity for platforms that enable crowdsourcing of labour. Or ease one to seek employment as an independent contract worker.
 Look at it this way; The same way Uber is able to use drivers without paying Social Security and other benefits, businesses will be able to do the same. A business will only hire someone to execute tasks as an independent contractor.
 Already, local players in this space include ProInterns. While globally platforms available for crowd-sourcing labour are growing by the day. Notable ones include PeoplePerHour, UpWork, Fiverr and more.

 Also read: We raised funding from Greentec &amp; Village Capital, Henri Nyakarundi
 The company CEO, Eric Yong said:  One of the biggest challenges for innovative startups in Africa is the implementation of solutions with distribution channels that have Pan-African reach.
 Adding that  Bismart’s application of emerging technologies solves this problem brilliantly, while disrupting the insurance value chain from customer acquisition to risk management.
 Founded in July 2017, by Eunice Wagithi Maina, Bismarts vision is to enable every African to access insurance.
 Currently, according to the statement, insurance adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa is in the low single digits with South Africa as an exception with a rate above 10%.
 This is partly due to lack of trust, reliance by insurance companies on traditional premium collections and claims payout means as well as unsteady cash flow by the consumers.
 Bismart will, thus, enable its users to access insurance in a without the burden of immediate out-of-pocket payments, in a transparent, convenient, and friendly manner.
 According to GreenTec capital, before raising from them, Bismart had an initial commitment from another investor. WhicWazi Vision Secures $800,000, Joins Safarini Translator and Divine Masters as Ugandan Startups Funded by GreenTec Capital

"6 lessons a founder learned from the Alibaba eFounders Fellowship
","On his maiden visit to Africa last year, Jack Ma promised to support African tech startup founders. This year, he delivered on his promise. Through a partnership with UNCTAD, they took on startup founders from Africa for the Alibaba e-Founder Initiative Fellowship. These totaled 80+.
 From conversations with founders that are part of the program, some said that the program has been very beneficial. Apart from changing their business models, they have gone on to make significant internal changes in their startups.
 I had a sit down with Nielsimms Sangho, the founder and CEO of Intership, one of the startups selected for the program. Intership is an e-commerce startup from Uganda. It won the 2015 Seedstars Kampala.
 Niel, together with dozens of other African tech founders, made the trip to Hangzhou in June this year. There, they not only saw first hand what Alibaba is but also closer one-on-one engagements with the founder, Jack Ma.
 In conversation with Niel, he walked me through some of the key lessons he learned. Some he has already started implementing while others he is looking to put in place with time. Below is a summary of the lessons;
 1. Think Long-term
 Jack Ma is usually quoted speaking of how he wants Alibaba to transcend him. The former teacher says that he wants it to span three centuries. Thus, it is not surprising that Niel points out long-term thinking as one of the key lessons he learned from the fellowship.
 “This is the thing I liked with Alibaba,” Niel started, “they have to understand that maybe we will not even see the results of what we are trying to change.” He added that Jack Ma “was very comfortable saying, ‘maybe I will not benefit from what I am trying to push forward, but I am still willing to do it’”.
 When the fellows met him, Ma told them the same thing. He emphasized that although they have to survive, they should also aspire to be a part of something bigger. “So finding that balance is the trick,” Niel pointed out. But said that it is his current aspiration.
 2. Collective Activism
 Another key thing he learned is the need to work together or in unison when it comes to issues that affect all the founders. “We want to begin having this discussion with the government,” he said. This stems from the fact that governments aren’t paying attention to the value of e-commerce in their countries as well as on the continental level.
 But beyond that, they haven’t also realized that there are support structures necessary to support it and other industries.
 “E-commerce works in a triangle; People have to be able to pay and there has to be logistics, then, again, you have to have people to give the product,” Niel pointed out. Before emphasizing how important the role of the government is in building the above.
 Also read: Alibaba founder Jack Ma to visit all African countries in 15 years
 “For some of those things to happen, you cannot leave out the government,” he says. Adding that people should not sit back hoping that the government will act. Implying that founders need to come out and engage their respective governments.
 “If I make noise alone, no one will listen to me. But If I make noise, and you make noise and others make noise, if we make noise together, the government will say, ‘you know what, what if we do it’. So we are supposed to be our own unity.”
 3. Collaboration
 However much startups maybe competitors in their respective vertical, Niel thinks that these should always leave room for working together. In the end, he believes that this will lead to greater economies of scale as well as fully realizing the market potential.
 “That is what Alibaba did, and that is why Alibaba is big,” Niel singled out Alibaba’s moved to start supporting their competitors. Alibaba reached a point where they were so far ahead with technology, and they had left everyone. So they got that technology, and they put in the computers and said use.
 In fact, Niel says that if you work at Alibaba for more than 5 years, the company advises you to get a job at a competitors place. This is because they want everyone else to grow. In the end, it leads to building the economies of scale that benefit everyone. For example, if companies worked together to bring to life a cashless economy, all would benefit from it.
 But also, when it comes to selfish interests, Niel says that no one likes monopolies. Not government, not even the consumers. Take the example of Microsoft. Bill Gates strategically invested in Apple in the 1990s when the company was at the verge of collapsing. What Gates looked at was avoiding being a monopoly. Because then, you’re looked at as a bad guy.
 4. Think Data
 Although Alibaba is known to many as an e-commerce company, Niel says, that isn’t the case. “Alibabas business is data,” he emphasizes. Pointing out that they gave them a book which shows that Alibaba owns more than 30 companies. “But all these are focused on data,” Niel said.
 Alibaba is doing that because they want to learn how the customer behaves as much as possible. “Jack Mas vision was to understand the Chinese consumer,” Niel says. But, to achieve this, he knew that data had to be at the center. So, they built this big data engine called Alimama.”
 Alibaba isn’t alone. Uber, Amazon, Airbnb, Netflix and all 21st Century companies have data at the heart of their existence. “Because of that, they now push out stuff that is customised to the user individually,” Niel sums it up.
 5. Obsess about the customer
 Most often when one is starting out, they are advised to start with a problem in mind, not the solution. Yet, it is not uncommon for many founders to do the vice versa. Niel says that customers are at the center of Alibaba. And, he advises that one should develop a product that is almost an extension of the customer’s life.
 Yet, according to Niel, this goes beyond just having good customer service. Rather, it requires putting the customer at the center of everything. “Jack Ma told us one thing, that ‘look, when we sit in a meeting, we put an empty seat and that’s for the customer’, Niel says.
 “[Customer service] is important, yes, but even in the process of writing the first line of code, ask yourself if what you’re working on is something that someone would look at and actually use,” Niel advised. “At the core of every meeting, of every discussion, of every design process, the customer should be at the center,” he added.
 6. Company culture and purpose
 When one starts a startup, there usually are many opportunities that might show up along the way. These might lead to founders veering off. Additionally, things might get hard along the way leading to one thinking that perhaps they need to change course.
 Niel says that in all this, the key lesson he learned was sticking to the purpose and why you started. “Of course, the first thing, like I told you is mission, vision, and values,” he said. The key question to ask himself and the team is “why are we here and how do we get to where we want to get.”
 He adds that knowing what to do is not enough. You must also know what you shouldnt do. “[We also have to know] what are our no-go areas, what are we going to do for sure, what are we never going to do for sure,” he pointed out.
 Though it is not enough that only the founding team knows this, he has learned that this has to permeate the entire company. “Those things, if you know them every day and they are stuck in every employee,” he says, “then you know you’re on the right track.”
 “They can be on the wall and what, but it is one thing to live like that,” he cautions.
 Normally, founders are focused on the KPIs. This implies that as long as an employee is delivering, they won’t mind if they are delivering the right way.
 Niel learned that it is key to find out if how these employees are doing things is how you would like them to. Which points to the company culture. “I think what would be valuable to people over here is if you know what you are doing, no matter if you are seeing results,” he says.

"Egypt&#8217;s Wasla officially launches with $180k in Pre-Seed funding
","Wasla, a browser that subsidizes users costs, has launched with $180,000 in pre-seed funding. The startup made the announcement at the recently concluded RiseUp Summit in Egypt.
 After a year of developing the platform in stealth, Wasla successfully launched its product at the 2018 Rise Up Summit, they wrote.
 The startup claims to have attracted over 2,000 users organically in under 48hours after the launch. This traction landed Wasla the #2 spot on the Google Play Store Trending Apps, they added.
 The startup raised the funding from a group of strategic angel investors led by Omar Barakat.
 According to the press release, Wasla will channel the funds to the launch of the beta testing phase. They will also focus on fueling user growth as well as to building the necessary marketing and technology infrastructure.

 Wasla’s target market comprises of prepaid smartphone users between the ages of 13-40. This, according to the startup, represents the majority of the Egyptian population.
 
 In Egypt, over 97% of households have access to mobile internet, while only 42% have access to ADSL, which leaves almost 55% of households reliant on mobile internet.
 
 Currently, they only have the Android web browser. But, it is unlikely that they will launch on any other operating system. Especially, when you consider their target market.
 The Wasla Browser subsidizes users mobile data costs by leveraging digital advertising.
 It gamifies the user’s experience by allowing them to freely surf the internet all while completing in-app missions and actions to earn points. [These] are ultimately redeemable for free mobile data and airtime directly from Wasla’s very own ‘Wasla-wallet’.

"DataHack4FI Season 2 is back, here&#8217;s how you can participate
","Last month, DataHack for Financial Inclusion (DataHack4FI) Season 2  an initiative of insight2impact (i2i) was launched at The Innovation Village in partnership with Financial Sector Deepening Uganda (FSDU) and The Innovation Village.
 DataHack4FI is an African innovation competition that encourages finance, tech and data enthusiasts to collaborate in using data and analytics to solve business challenges and extend financial services to underserved communities.
 The competition is targeting existing companies that have already launched a product, have customers and are collecting data.
 There are six country-level competitions, and entrants must reside in one of these countries. These include; Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Rwanda, and Zambia. The winning team in each country will be invited to pitch their solution at the 2018 DataHack4FI competition finals in Rwanda.
 Season 2 of DataHack4FI won’t follow a traditional hackathon format. Instead of informal teams being presented with the same set of data to analyse, this year they are encouraging existing tech companies to take a fresh look at the data they are already collecting by partnering with a data science fellow.
 
 We believe that through analysis of this data it may be possible to develop new solutions to address the financial needs of low-income communities (particularly women and youth), the communication says.
 
 The grand finals will be held in May 2018 and the winning solution will be awarded US$ 25,000. But the launch date, deadline for entry and in-country competition finals differ for each country. For Uganda, the launch date was 29th December 2017 and deadline for the application is 26th January 2018.
 Meet-ups will be held on different dates, and once you have signed up to participate, The Innovation Village  which is the partner hub in Uganda will be in touch with you about these and generally, the meet-ups will be held at their offices.
 Solutions will be scored on a number of factors, including whether it: addresses financial inclusion challenges in Africa, demonstrates how data and analytics were used, shows how customers would benefit from using it, has been developed in a way that enabled capacity building for young people involved in the process and ideally benefits women and/or youth.
 Season 1 was held last year and team Mobiticket from Kenya was awarded the top spot in the i2i DataHack4FI Innovation Award competition. The second and third places went to Killer Analytics from Uganda and Team Jobs from Rwanda respectively.

"Dear Wantpreneurs, Let MVPs Be MVPs!
","Yesterday, some gentleman called Allan called me. He wanted us to start a business together. Because? He had seen my posters advertising CV writing and Dissertation that I had pinned around Makerere University.
 He didnt know that I was carrying out some case study. Though I also do the services in my free times.
 Back to Allan
 He told me that he was working on developing a web platform that can help people write CVs as well receive instant job notifications. He poured his pitch of how he is looking at helping fight unemployment in the end.
 In all honesty, I thought it was far fetched. People are not failing to get jobs because of poorly written CVs. But anyway, we shall leave it at that because addressing the causes of unemployment isnt the intention of this write-up.
 What I was really interested in was Allans MVP. Plus, if he had done some basic research.
 The first question I usually ask someone starting is; Is what youre proposing the most basic way to start? Some people just say yes thinking theyll avoid more questions from me.
 While others, especially IT people with skills that build apps and web platforms for themselves, say yes because they think theyre not incurring any costs.
 So, the next question is always I have for the IT people is; How much would you charge someone to develop for you that website. The one youve done for free?
 Some are honest enough to state the correct figure while others, out of fear of being criticized and victimized, grossly underestimate the figure.
 
 If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late  Reid Hoffman, Co-founder LinkedIn 
 
 But what I tell them is that the amount they would have paid another person is what they have spent trying to come up with their platforms. Some realize it and agree, others dont.
 And when you ask how long theyll take to recover their initial free investment  majority give you a wild uncalculated guess  just to impress and alleviate their guilt.
 Back to the MVP issue
 This is the second time in a month Im trying to understand if someone didnt have any other less basic way of launching other than an app or website.
 The first one, a friend and OB (again), came to my inbox excited to tell me to try out their new app. He was surprised to be met with questions that he ended up retreating  abandoning a conversation he had initiated.
 His plan was that developing a cool app would automatically attract people to use it. He also assumed that hed just add a store to his app and people will be excited to buy from him.
 So, I asked if he knew the most downloaded app in Uganda and why. He said, Matatu. Then I asked if he knew how much the likes of Jumia and Uber have injected in driving their app downloads. He said he was aware, but Im sure he doesnt know.
 So we went back and forth with me trying to get him to understand on his own that he had a better way to kickstart without an app. At worst, I expected him to have a website.
 Going back to Allan
 Allan was heading the same direction. His guess was that coming up with a cool website would automatically solve his problems of getting users. He thinks that if he opens up a Facebook page and LinkedIn Group/page, as recommended by me, his users wouldnt come.
 But then I informed him that BrighterMonday &amp; Jumia Jobs are in the same sphere with slightly a decent amount of funding but BrighterMonday is struggling here.
 Secondly, theres Workable, Monster, Lynda.com and a whole host of websites that one can use in case they want to generate CVs.
 If one wanted a CV in Uganda, chances are theyre not looking to go to a website and generate it there. What theyre looking for is a one-on-one with the person working on it.
 To cut this short, I recommended that he starts with a Facebook page/group and a LinkedIn page/group. This would keep his MVP as an MVP.
 Yet this doesnt only go to Allan and my OB. It goes out to all wantrepreneurs. Having an attractive application or product is really satisfying but is not necessary.
 On the contrary, I recommend that you start with something really basic and keep building on that. Remember these words from Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, If you are not embarrassed by the first version (Minimum Viable Product) of your product, you’ve launched too late.

"Flutterwave, Africa&#8217;s Talking to support forLoop Africa as it expands to cover 10 African countries
","forLoop Africa, a community of software developers across the African continent, has signed partnerships with several companies across the continent. The list includes Flutterwave, Africas Talking, Whogohost, Cloudinary and recently Gitlab.
 
  
 
 
 This was confirmed to us in an email chat with Ridwan Olalere, the forLoop Africa founder, and Sally Mugure, the developer outreach in charge at Africas Talking.
 
 
  
 
 
 These companies align with our vision to develop more world-class developers across the continent through collaborative learning and distributed mentoring, Ridwan wrote in an email.
 
 
  
 
 
 Earlier on, we had written to Africas Talking to confirm a rumor about a cash injection in the region of USD 20,000  30,000 into the forLoop Africa community. But, in the same conversation, they declined to confirm nor deny.
 
 
  
 
 
 Sally Mugure, however, said that they are not investing in the community. Though admitted they are currently sponsoring their activities.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Just a clarification, we are not investing in forLoop, we are simply sponsoring their activities as they launch into 10 African countries in 2018, Sally Mugure wrote in an email. Sally also added that they are very excited to be working closely with them. 
 
 
 
 Ridwan clarified that the partnerships are in form of monetary, social, and expansion support. Yet declining to point out how much in monetary terms. Saying, I am not sure Flutterwave, Africastalking, Cloudinary, Gitlab (just confirmed) want me to discuss this.
 
 
  
 
 
 Currently, the forLoop Africa community covers Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, and Ghana.  With Malawi, Tanzania, Egypt, South Africa, Rwanda, Tanzania, Benin, and Ghana that were set for 2018 also able to start the community earlier. Though Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe will be joining in 2018.
 
 
  
 
 
 We are creating the largest independent developer community across Africa which will help increase the world-class competency, Ridwan wrote.
 
 
 
 Related: forLoop Kampala organizing an All Java Everything themed event
 
 
 The community is a non-profit, that is self-funded.
 
 
  
 
 
 We the organizers, the board of trustees also use our funds to finance the activities. In fact, in the past 17 months, the most money for financing was from us the board of trustees, Ridwan wrote.
 
 
  
 
 
 The partners will be supporting the developers in the forLoop community as a way of giving back. forLoop, in return, will promote their services during their events.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 I think the most important thing you should take away from this partnership is that we will be working together to encourage the evolution of better engineers as we also work on reducing any pain points that they may face when trying to build solutions, Sally Mugure wrote.
 
 
 
 These pain points, according to Sally, include access to relevant tech content, mentorship, talent pipeline, access to resources you need while building a solution and a whole lot more.
 
 
  
 
 
 Commenting on how the two parties will work together, Sally says they will be working together on developer outreach initiatives, especially in campuses.
 
 
  
 
 
 This will be everything from organizing events to creating helpful instructive content for the student and a couple of other exciting projects that can come up along the way.

"Kilimall has completely shut down its Ugandan business
","Kilimall, an e-commerce company, has shut down its Ugandan business according to Dennis Nyunyuzi who is familiar with the matters that I spoke to. Kilimall is not operating in Uganda locally [anymore], he said.
 Dennis, who was partnering with Jay Cho  a Japanese businessman  to take over and revive Kilimall in Uganda locally, added that it is only doing the international business.
 For a while, Dennis and Jay Cho were locked in conversations with a team from Kilimall including one of the Chinese co-founders to take over the companys franchise in Uganda.
 Initially, when we went to Kenya to actually get the franchise, everything went well, he said.
 Jay Chos company, Pink Tie  which handles logistics for almost all e-commerce companies in Uganda  was also handling deliveries for Kilimall. And when the company started to struggle in the market, he had conversations with the co-founders.
 He, therefore, teamed up with Dennis  who had just left Jumia Mall Uganda to take on the Kilimall in Uganda. Dennis had worked as a Category Manager at Jumia from way before the rebranding  when they were still called Kaymu  until October 2017.
 With his experience, and Jays superiority in logistics and fulfillment, they thought were the right people to take up the limping venture. Ideally, I would control the commodity side of the entity, and he (Jay) would control the logistics and operations side of the entity, Dennis said.
 The arrangement would give Dennis and Jay the majority stake  which they would split  while the Chinese co-founders would retain the minority stake.
 This was initially a gentlemans agreement. We had a verbal agreement, he said. Yet, when they advanced to formalize it, there were twists and turns.
 
 But as we continued to discuss and send an agreement to them, they turned it down. Theres a certain business model they wanted to focus on and we were not aligned, he added.
 
 However, the arrangements further hit a dead end when the co-founders suggested that both Dennis and Jay instead buy out the Ugandan franchise.
 The conversations dragged on until early August this year when both parties decided to go separate ways. So, my partner Jay at that time decided to let go of the business, Dennis said.
 The cause of the disagreement stems from the differences in priority, business model, and strategy.
 So we wanted to do the local business as well as the international business but as the days went down they started changing that they wanted to focus on international business, Dennis said.
 Both Dennis and Jay were big on local business as they deem it more lucrative compared to the international one. We tried to tell them that if they could focus on the local business, we would be able to bring in another channel of revenue, he said.
 Dennis and Jay were looking at leveraging their experience in the market.  For my case, I am partners with most of the brands so I am able to put most of them on the platform, he said.

 As for Jay, his company Pink Tie handles deliveries for Jumia Mall, Jumia Party, Jumia Food, KFC, Pizza Hut and a couple of other e-Commerce platforms in the country.
 Yet, the co-founders were more inclined to focus on the international one. Before deciding to shut down the local business entirely, the international business was contributing a meager 0.5% to Kiliamall Ugandas business, according to him.
 Jays company  Pink Tie  is also likely to have completely cut ties with Kilimall, including the logistics support for their international business. Jay declined to comment on the issue when I visited him at his office yesterday in Naguru.
 But, I was informed that he had requested Kilimall to pick up their remaining consignment in his warehouse.
 Currently, if anyone orders a product from a Ugandan vendor on Kilimall, chances are they wont get it. I am not yet sure if those who are ordering from international vendors are still able to get theres. Though their website is still up and running.
 Launched in Uganda in May 2016, Kilimall started going down from as early as late last year when they laid off a significant number of employees. But in a call with Wang Chengyang, the MD at that time, he denied it. And, yet, here we are.
 The departure of Kilimall leaves Jumia as the major player in the local market. A player Dennis thinks has at least an 80% market share. He also placed a 15% market on Kikuu with the rest being scrambled for by other players.
 Note: Some figures have been retracted from the article for privacy purposes. However, the context and accuracy of the information have not been tampered with.

"Digesting the changes in Fezah subscription terms. Is the timing right?
","Entertainment booking app Fezah yesterday announced a change in musician subscription terms. Musicians in Uganda will now pay an annual subscription fee of UGX 350,000 to join the Fezah App, wrote Elijah Kitaka, the company CEO.
 The platform has previously operated 3 subscription plans  Basic, Pro, and Exclusive. Fezah Basic was free to join, Fezah Pro was $100 per year with access to the Insights dashboard and more, while Fezah Exclusive is for a very select set of artists.
 In a Facebook chat, Elijah opened up on how research defined the changes.
 Through data, we’ve established that artists that have access to and use the data available on our dashboards perform better than those that don’t, he wrote.
 The main difference with this change, he adds, is that everyone on the platform will now get access to the insights dashboard.
 Who is the beneficiary? 
 The musicians. Elijah says that the change does not affect clients, nor stakeholders. The change doesnt affect them at all. The change also doesnt affect DJs / MCs on the app. This is a change to Fezah for Musicians subscription plans.
 According to Elijah, the subscription is like a musicians commitment to investing in their career while receiving gigs to work on and timely market information about their work.
 The app works with 6 great stages/events on which there are dedicated slots placed for artists.
 Most importantly through our market intelligence suite, we have arguably the most useful dataset that a musician can get access to in our market today, he noted.

 Is the timing right?
 Elijah asserts Fezah has invested enough in building the platform, and the time is ripe for a fixed subscription plan. Over the last 3 years, weve taken a lot of steps to provide more value to artists on the platform.
 He adds that they now have 2 weekly radio shows that are focused on driving airplay for our musicians.
 Fezah currently has over 200 artists on the platform, based on the previous subscription plans. Elijah confirmed that there are plans to go beyond Uganda and Kenya.
 We already started scouting for talent in Rwanda and we plan to launch there before the end of this year.

"The Fashion Incubator is fitting fashion entrepreneurs in Egypt for a life in the garment industry
","The Fashion Incubator Middle East is taking it upon itself to offer entrepreneurial and sartorial advice to startups in the textile and clothing industry in Egypt.
 There is a high rate of failure when one ventures into the unknown that is the startup scene. In the garment industry, this is more pronounced because of the very nature of the business – it is labor intensive and highly competitive.
 There have been some standouts, though. Fashion startup Okhtein has gone global and Cottonball is soon going regional. Despite their success, however, these two have had to elbow it out with some traditional names in the industry in order to make any sort of mark.
 Nohir Saleh of The Fashion Incubator (TFI) has decided to house various fashion startups in her incubator. Here, the entrepreneurs can focus on their craft and also pick up some business sense to ensure the longevity of their stylish venture when they finally depart the nest.
 The Challenge
 For many people, fashion is an artistic thing. The designer harnesses their creative juice to come up with fashionable garments. However, it also requires one to have a great mind for business in order to be successful.
 But among all those brilliant minds, few ever have the business skills to equip them for a life in the cutthroat world that is the fashion industry. It’s no surprise, therefore, that many of the startups wither and crumble like silk when the heat turns up.
 “Many fashion designers don’t know from where to start; there’s a pain-point in this industry where entrepreneurs are torn between the artistic, creative part, and the business and strategy part, and on top of all of this, some vendors take advantage of the entrepreneurs’ inexperience and attempt to rip them off,” says Nohir Saleh.
 Lifeline
 However, with the advent of technology – eons ahead of the weaving loom – various tech-based fashion startups are still daring to raise their head in Cairo and across Egypt.
 And this shouldn’t be surprising given that the global garment industry is worth $3 trillion. Egypt is uniquely positioned to take a slice out of this pie because of its significant cotton production and export numbers. Couple this with the technology and passion of the entrepreneurs and you have a sector ready to take off.
 According to Startup Scene ME, Mohamed Maher, vice-chairman and CEO of local investment bank Prime Holding said, “Any labor-intensive industries, including textile production, which used to be a dying industry, now have a good chance with improved labor costs and technologies to help to start a new era of production, both for the big local market and exports.”
 The Solution
 So despite the odds being stacked against them, many fashion entrepreneurs in Egypt are still willing to bootstrap and go through with founding their startups in the fashion industry.
 As the first incubator tailored to suit the needs of fashion entrepreneurs, The Fashion Incubator is making a difference.
 Whereas other incubators take on startups on a cyclical schedule, it admits and incubates startups individually. In this way, the Incubator would be more focused on each startup’s fashion line with little to no distractions.
 A startup meets with the TFI team and describes their brand and designs. TFI’s purchasing team takes over, bringing fabric samples to the entrepreneur before acquiring the amount needed. Marketing then takes over, formulating strategy and opening up its network to the startup.
 Global view
 African fashion has been in the spotlight of late. Renowned high fashion house Dior recently held a successful albeit controversial show of its 2020 line which primarily features African wax print designs.
 Further west in Africa, in late 2018 Nigerian fashion startup Fashpa, took part in the Dream Assembly accelerator in Lisbon, Portugal where $35,000 was up for grabs alongside mentoring and training.
 With the success of incubators like Dream Assembly, The Fashion Incubator ME just might have a number of successful African fashion startups under its wing.

"SEMA wants to fix Uganda&#8217;s broken public sector feedback system
","SEMA, a startup developing feedback tools, wants to change how the public sector receives feedback. This, in the end, they believe would lead to increased accountability.
 Nathalie Dijkman, a co-founder and CEO, says that she conceived the idea after realizing the lack of accountability. I thought of the idea about a year ago when I realized that there was no accountability of public services in Uganda, she said.
 Adding that she knew there had to be a better way to give voice to the citizens about how they experience services.
 It was from here that she teamed up with two other friends, Connor Sattely and Timothy Kakuru.
 Connor had before co-founded Gov Faces in Switzerland while Timothy co-founded BarefootLaw. For Nathalie, she had worked for 3 years on access to justice and accelerating start-ups with HiiL.
 Together, they decided to bring the idea to life. We applied for D-Prize and as soon as we got it, we set up the legal entity [and] incorporated in February this year, Nathalie wrote.
 Seven months later, the startup has prototypes and testing them in the market. We are still testing new versions of our products, but at the same time have gone to market with what we have and are selling.
 Also read: Kampala Angel Investors Network deal day is, finally, set for October
 To-date, they have had at least 7,000 people use their tool for feedback in Kampala.
 Most of SEMAs clients are government institutions. We currently work with 2 clients  Uganda Police Force and KCCA. Beyond these, they have also deployed their tools at 12 public offices around Kampala.
 SEMA places feedback tools at places where it is easier for the users of the government services to see. This is usually the entrances or exits. The tool has five emoji buttons ranked from angry to happy and the user can press any, depending on how they feel.
 One of SEMAs feedback tools. Photo: SEMA
 The tools then gather the data that the SEMA team analyzes. Our feedback tools gather data on a daily basis, and we analyze it weekly, she wrote. Though they bring out the reports monthly,
 This means that every month, we produce a short and easy to understand feedback report for each office, Nathalie wrote. These reports show exactly what the rating is of that office, and the feedback given. Beyond data and reports, they also offer customer satisfaction training to these institutions.
 Their model, thus, is that these institutions pay for all these services.
 Currently, SEMA deploys hardware tools with the emojis. Yet, these are prone to bias especially when one person presses the buttons several times. Nathalie says that the devices can ignore multiple button presses within a certain time limit. In other words, they will time out after 10 seconds when you do many presses.
 
 Even if someone does game the system by learning the time limit and pressing the button at perfect intervals, such intervals are easily identified in our live data dashboard, and data can be corrected during analysis.
 
 Apart from the pressing bias, I also think that the data gathered that way cant be informative enough.
 For example, if one presses the happy button, youd have the data but no reason on. Which, in the end, does little when it comes to improving processes or services.
 But, Nathalie says that they have lined up other ways of capturing feedback and the devices are one of them. Together, she believes that the data can be informative enough,
 The other two feedback tools we deploy  an IVR phone line encouraging voice recordings, and face-to-face interviews at the offices themselves  add richness to this data.
 Apart from the $30,000 received from the D-Prize, the startup has also received $18,000. This was from the Knowledge Management Fund to test how the data can actually lead to improved public services. Nathalie also said that they have put in their own savings.
 Though a not-for-profit, SEMA is looking to explore raising external funding to the tune of $250,000. Additionally, they are also looking at the possibility of registering a for-profit arm that can be in a position to raise equity investment.

"SolarNow closes $9M to deploy new off-grid solar systems across Uganda
","SolarNow, a Uganda-based company that sells and finances solar home systems, has raised $9 million in debt. SunFunder, a longtime debt financier for the company arranged the debt facility alongside co-lenders responsAbility and Oikocredit.
 The funding comes 3 months after SolarNow raised a $740,000 grant from the Mastercard Foundation Fund for Rural Prosperity. According to Digest Africa Deals Data, the amount puts the company among the top five most funded in Uganda last year.
 According to SunFunder, SolarNow will use the debt to scale its services across Uganda. The financing will enable the company to deploy 17,500 new off-grid solar systems to customers in Uganda, wrote SunFunder. This, they hope, will result in approximately 2.5MW of new installed off-grid solar capacity.
 
 Among the expected impacts, SolarNow estimates that more than 70,000 women will gain improved energy access in Uganda and [avoid] over 210,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions through [dispacing] kerosene for lighting.
 
 Last year, SunFunder raised $25 million from Overseas Private Investment Corporation  OPIC. This was part of the commitment to its $100 million Solar Energy Transformation Fund. It also announced that it had secured an undisclosed amount from the Shell Foundation towards the same fund.
 With only the $25 million they disclosed considered, SunFunder raised the 9th highest amount for a fund focused on Africa last year according to our Digest Africa INDEX report. It is thus likely that they made the investment into SolarNow from this particular fund.
 This facility is SolarNow’s 3rd structured asset finance instrument (SAFI) that SunFunder has arranged. It is also the 3rd syndication that the solar-focused lender has done together with responsAbility and Oikocredit. As well as the 2nd such syndication for SolarNow, following a similar $6 million facility 14 months ago.
 The new investment marks both the 5th-anniversary SunFunders partnership with SolarNow. As well as a total of $19 million that the former has delivered for SolarNow. The investments have been through direct and syndicated lending.
 Founded in 2011 by Willem Nolens, SolarNow has now raised at least $30 million in funding  across different deal types  according to our data.

"Updated: Former U.S. VP Al Gore&#8217;s firm leads Andela&#8217;s $100M Series D
","Andela, an Africa-focused outsourcing firm for software engineers, is raising a $100 million Series D led by Generation Investment Management according to a report by Bloomberg Businessweek. The round also saw participation from existing investors including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GV, Spark Capital, and CRE Venture Capital.
 According to Bloomberg, the round will bring Andelas total funding raised to date to $180 million. Before this round, the firm had previously raised roughly $81 million from four different rounds. Their recent round of funding was a $40 million Series C  announced in October 2017  that Johannesburg-based CRE Venture Capital led.
 Over time, Andela has had a couple of notable investors take part in its fundraises including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative which led their $24 million Series B that was announced in June 2016. Omidyar Network, GV and Salesforce Ventures are among the other notable investors.
 Also read: Over a dozen African countries have reached out to us – Andela CEO
 Across Africa, there havent been many technology firms that have raised rounds of venture capital equalling to $100 million onwards. Except for Jumia Group which has raised €130 million and €360 million for their Series B and Series C respectively according to CrunchBase data. In 2014, South Africas e-Commerce player  Takealot  also raised $100 million from Tiger Global Management before being acquired by Naspers last year.
 The Generation deal would, therefore, be among the third largest venture investment ever for an African startup according to CB Insights data. The other companies that have raised significant amounts like M-Kopa  have primarily secured debt or private equity financing.
 Founded in 2014 by Brice Steven Nkengsa, Christina Sass, Ian Carnevale, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Jeremy Johnson and Nadayar Enegesi, Andela has seen rapid expansion across the continent. The firm which started from Lagos now has operations in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda.
 Andela has about 1,100 developers on staff working for more than 200 companies, nearly 90 percent of which are located in the U.S. The firms entry into Rwanda was through a joint partnership with the Rwandan government which saw it establish a Pan-African Hub that accepts software engineers from all African countries. There were also indicators for the company to expand to other parts of the continent like Egypt, but no confirmation has been made yet.
 Generation Investment Management is a London-based private equity firm with former US Vice President Al Gore serves as Vice President. The firm has previously backed Silicon Valley startups like Asana and DeepMap. It also participated in M-Kopas $19 million and $10 million rounds that it raised in 2015 and 2018 respectively.

"What happened to Yoza App? [Part 3 of 3]
","Progress does not occur in one particular direction. In a constantly changing environment, you have to be able to react and the decisions you make affect not only you but everyone around you.
 “Failure is where all the lessons are.”
 We had figured out a repeatable business model and yes it was a struggle to keep serving new clients manually, but we knew that if we got smartphones in the hands of the washers, we would start making profits and continue growing.
 The search for funding
 We applied for various competitions to try and meet as many investors in the hope of attracting some investments in our product. The investors were never interested and this continued through the end of the year.
 We got accepted in various competition with the hope of raising money but everyone who liked the concept told us to come back when you have a few thousand customers. We also saw a similar trend with our target customers who didn’t want to use the service but thought the service was so cool. But, entrepreneurs make money when you use their service/product not when you think it’s so cool
 Google launchpad was one of our last competition. And, around the time our co-founders were busy pitching the product in Nairobi, I started going through the financials. I discovered that the business model was repeatable in a sense that customers were returning to the product but weren’t scalable in a sense that the new customers were not efficiently matched to the washers and this lead to high operating costs.
 Honesty
 I believe being honest with yourself is the first step in the right direction. Even if wrong, you won’t regret something as long as you were honest about it. So, in 2017, I was determined to do more of what worked and less of what didn’t work.
 I also discovered that we had one great source of income that steamed from doing payment integrations for certain businesses and we had also figured out something with powder detergent market research.
 While the team was in Kenya pitching, I called them up and told them that we might have to pivot from laundry and either focus on enabling as many businesses seamlessly accept payments or focus on recruiting as many washers across the country so that we can own the market research space for partners like IFF.
 
 Ego (noun): a person’s sense of self-esteem or self-importance
 
 The pivot idea wasn’t received well. I know it wasn’t fair for people to be pitching one idea and then here I was telling them that the laundry business was losing money and we had a unique opportunity to exploit one of the two opportunities we had on our hands.
 We had a lot of back and forth and at the start of 2017. But Isaac built an MVP that enabled any business to do a one-step checkout payment via mobile money for any business. We brought back the product to the team and explained how it would work. This was the start of a very long chain of ego-centric emails and no work was done.
 Diversification destruction
 Forget the single mothers, forget the customers, forget the profitability, this was a head-on collision and there was going to be only one of us left standing.
 Our brand name had created a lot of trust in the community and I thought if we rode on this name, we would create a suite of products that different people would use because they liked Yoza. The plan was also to make money from the payments product in order to fund the smartphone acquisition for the washers, straightforward right? WRONG.
 The conversation became so bitter that nothing really mattered. Either Solomon got his way or I got my way and after a bunch of meetings with the team, it was obvious our focus had changed and the company we started as friends was tearing us apart.
 We couldn’t even look each other in the face while talking to each other. We couldn’t allow each other to finish a sentence. We argued and there was no way forward and as I went home that evening I realized had been removed as an admin on Facebook and deleted from the company Whatsapp group.
 The mountain
 I immediately knew this had gone out of hand. I called up one of my mentors who told me something I have carried with me ever since.
 
 Mountain climbing is based on prioritized goals. First to come back alive, Second to come back with the friends you left with and finally to conquer the mountain.
 
 You set out on this journey as friends and succeed if you come out of this journey alive. That’s your first priority. If you can do that then come out with the friends you set out with on this journey. If possible, summit the mountain but make sure you get down to take on another mountain.
 We decided to let Solomon run the laundry business because he felt there was a lot he could do. We came out of this alive and as friends, Isaac myself and other partners set out to take on another mountain.
 Yoza has struggled since then. The website is now owned by some company trying to sell Bitcoin and the app is no where in the play store.
 I would like to end this by apologizing. First, to our customers, the people who actually used the product and the people who are still using the product by placing orders via phone calls. I apologize to our partners who trusted us and because of our selfish reasons, we messed up all the value we created.
 Lastly to the team and especially to Solomon, the summit is not important. What is important is the journey, the thrill of starting something and watching it change people’s lives.
 The lessons that we learned along the way were crucial and we now get to use those lessons to be better stronger and wiser to take on our next mountain.

 Quite interesting, there’s a lot of tech-savvy graduates in the country. According to GEM, Ugandans have a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship, Incellerate said.
 
 
  
 
 
 Inccelerate also quoted GEM’s profile on Uganda. It rates early-stage entrepreneurial activity at 35.5%, compared to 13.8% for the United States.
 
 
  
 
 
 Despite all the upsides from various reports, Uganda’s startup ecosystem remains problematic. This because of the fact that there’s a lack of startup culture among local startups.

"AirSave: Is this Ugandan Fintech Startup the Solution to Africa’s Unbanked Millions?
","Last evening, the Kampala Fintech meetup took place at the Innovation village in Ntinda – a Kampala suburb.
 Over 5 entrepreneurs made presentations about the fintech landscape in Uganda and the entire world. These included Moses Mugisha (Pulida Uganda), Emmanuel Chagara (Milima Technologies), Henry Ddamulira (Airsave Uganda), Maxime Dieudonné (Safe Boda), and many more!
 Airsave had the most compelling story of the day. Airsave is a financial technology (FinTech) company that provides a secure digital financial technological solutions and Financial literacy programs to community SACCO’s, mobile phone users and schools. The startup is partnering with Ecobank Ltd and Advisor insights INC  a U.S based Company.
 The services provided allows mobile phone users using Airtel money or MTN mobile money to register DIGITALLY to a SACCO on the platform and begin to save, borrow money, earn interest and earn commissions using a mobile phone as a solution towards eradication of poverty in communities.
 In his presentation, Henry Ddamulira, the CEO of Airsave, estimated the number of unbanked Africans at 600 million. Their aim is to work with everyone – whether in the urban or rural setting. Airsave allows one to save from as low as UGx. 5,000 ($1.5). Airsave’s goal is financial inclusion for everyone – they want to ensure that they work with everyone.
 Airsave wants to replace the traditional saving methods while working hand in hand with SACCOs and banks. It allows one to lock up their savings until they hit their target. This allows one to save for something in particular – say a motorcycle – and they are only allowed to withdraw the money after it hits that target.
 According to Airsave’s website, a study of 1,500 poor people in Uganda showed that 99 percent of respondents Failed to reach their savings goals when using informal methods, either because the money was stolen or lost, or because they were too tempted to spend the money when it was stored as cash in their home. And it is estimated that 3 out of 4 adults in developing and middle income countries don’t have bank accounts.
 In his words, Ddamulira says, “Airsave is a secure digital platform that serves the unbanked using a mobile phone in partnership with SACCOs and Banks. Our research indicates that over 90% of Africans are unbanked. This means they own no bank accounts and therefore using informal saving methods like Wooden Boxes. The problem with this is that Banks cannot know their financial history in order to offer them financial benefits like loans. Airsave platform enables unbanked SACCO members to create saving accounts and lock down their savings until they reach their goal.”
 Airsave has so far managed to secure an undisclosed amount of funding from the World Bank matching grant through the Private Sector Foundation of Uganda. This has enabled them run a pilot. They came in 2nd place last year at the Africa Startup Cup and also represented Uganda at the World Startup Cup where they came in at 4th place. Airsave team is comprised of 5 members.
 Other fintech startups that were represented at the meetup, which was attended by roughly 30 entrepreneurs, included Yoza Pay, Xente, Yodime, Borrocracy, Swap to Pay, Pulida, Milima Technologies, Laboremus Uganda etc.

"VC firm Sobek Capital opens Rwandan office, to invest $10,000 to $250,000
","Sean Obedih Ndiho has today announced that his VC firm, Sobek Capital, has opened its Rwandan office. It’s official Sobek Capital is now in Rwanda, he tweeted.
 We look forward to working tirelessly with all key stakeholders and build a viable venture capital industry in Rwanda, he added.
 Sean also shared a certificate of incorporation for the firm which indicated that it was registered on 20th July 2018.
 The offices are located at Kigali Heights, according to Sean.
 
 It’s official @SobekCapital is now in #Rwanda. We look forward to working tirelessly with all key stakeholders and build a viable venture capital industry in #Rwanda. Thanks to everyone @RDBrwanda pic.twitter.com/3A1j8joyUw
 — Sean Ndiho Obedih (@SObedih) July 25, 2018
 He says the decision to open an office for his UK-based firm is partly based on the fact that he was born in the country.
 Because I was born in Rwanda and wanted to come back and help to build my country after 20 years in the UK, Sean told me.
 Even before opening offices, Seans Sobek Capital was active in Rwanda with a couple of investments made so far.
 Also read: BeneFactors Ltd named the winner of Seedstars Kigali
 Asked if there are any more deals they are looking to sign soon, he said yes. Yes absolutely, but these deals will be announced over the next few weeks as we are still going through negotiations.
 Sobek Capital describes itself as an alternative Venture Capital firm. Something Sean explains as being masters of our destiny.
 As I have documented before I personally believe that the traditional VC model doesn’t work in Africa. Sean pointed out.
 
 We are creating an alternative investment model that includes hands-on operational excellence. We embed people into the companies that we choose to invest in.
 
 These views stem from what the experiences he described in this medium that article he wrote last year.
 Founded in 2017, Sobek Capital invests between $10,000 to $250,000 even though it has Sean Obedih as the only Limited Partner.
 This is what I have found that most businesses need, they are in dire need of structural changes and processes, Sean said. But, he says that after investing, they then bring in more partners.
 Also read: Rwanda signs MoU with Andela to establish “the first Pan-African tech hub” in Kigali
 The firm has no specific stage at which they come in and Sean describes Sobek Capital as a stage agnostic firm.
 UPDATE
 This article had previously indicated that Sobek Capital had invested in BeneFactors Limited. However, that has since been changed with the request from both parties to leave it out, as there are some details that still need to be worked on.

"13 rounds (adding up to $11M) from 2018 that you didn&#8217;t know took place
","Last year was filled with a lot of activity that it was so easy for one to miss some of it. According to our research, it was probably the highest year that startups and companies in Africa  with holding companies in the US  filed with the SEC.
 While as the amounts disclosed went up, there were those that were either not disclosed or inaccurately disclosed We decided to dig them up. Throughout December 2018, we wrote about some of them that were either recent or big in size. Some of them include; African Leadership Academys $28 million, PrepClasss $300,000, Halans $4.4 million, BitPesas $2.2 million, Lori Systems $6.1 million and SafeBodas $1.1 million.
 However, to sum it up, we have decided to bring you the comprehensive list. Please note that this list includes startups that raised funding but the figures were reported inaccurately (UbaPesa &amp; Ensibuuko). Or those that were not disclosed at all (Kopa Technologies, Gokada, Names &amp; Faces). They are ranked in ascending order. This list of 13 startups has funding amounting to $11.7 million.
 1. BuyCoins  $120,000
 Unlike other Nigerian startups  like Cowrywise and Kobo360  that were admitted into Y Combinator in 2018, very few noticed that BuyCoins was also admitted. As one of the benefits of participating in the accelerator, the startup received $120,000 in funding. It also went on to receive an undisclosed amount from Precursor Ventures. (The startup is among our Digest Africa NEXT50  Top 50 Startup to watch in 2019).
 2. Passerine Aircraft Corporation  $120,000
 The South African startup, founded in 2017, develops electric-powered aircraft that can attain flight speed using a jumping mechanism. Like BuyCoins, few noticed its admission into Y Combinator last year after which it bagged $120,000 in funding.
 3. Rwanda Motor Cycle Company  $150,000
 Founded in 2016, Rwanda Motor Cycle Company  or RMC as mostly known  is a manufacturer of motorcycles that are specifically designed to meet all kinds of challenges. The company secured $150,000 in funding from an undisclosed investor last year according to the SEC filings of the company that we recovered. The deal closed in November 2018.
 4. Medsaf  $330,000
 Medsaf is making the process of buying and selling medication in Nigeria’s complex health system easy and efficient. The startup, founded in 2016, received funding from Lateral Capital in May last year which they declined to disclosed. However, checking their SEC filings revealed that they had raised $330,000 in funding  the exact amount they had set out to raise.
 5. Gokada  $337,300
 In March last year, Nigerias ride-hailing startup raised $337,300 in Seed round of funding from Adventure Capital and CRE Venture Capital. We got knowledge of this after checking the startups filings with the SEC. (The startup is among our Digest Africa NEXT50  Top 50 Startup to watch in 2019).
 6. Ensibuuko  $350,000
 Ugandas Ensibuuko is a provider of cloud-based micro-finance software for community-level financial entities. The startup was among those selected to join the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator last year. In turn, they also received grant funding from the Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund. However, platforms like CB Insights recorded it as $250,000 yet, according to Gerald Otim  Ensibuuko CEO and Co-founder  they raised £250,000 which translated into $350,000.
 7. UbaPesa  $450,000
 UbaPesa is a peer-to-peer money market app where users can borrow and lend money. Checking the startups CrunchBase page indicates that it raised $500,000 in funding in July 2018. However, when we contacted them, they clarified that they had instead raised $450,000 as a combination of both debt and equity.
 8. BeneFactors  $550,000
 Throughout the course of 2018, Rwanda-based BeneFactors raised a total of $550,000 in funding though most are familiar with the $150,000 it closed in September 2018. The startup secured the $550,000 as a mixture of debt and equity funding from Seedstars, NISK Capital and Silverback Capital. (The startup is among our Digest Africa NEXT50  Top 50 Startup to watch in 2019).
 9. Tastemakers Africa  $980,000
 Founded in 2016, Tastemakers Africa connects travellers to vetted local insiders in African cities. Though headquartered in the US, we classify the startup under South Africa (according to our methodology). Last year, it raised close to a million dollars from US-based Prercursor Ventures and CRE Venture Capital. (We wrote more about Precursor Ventures here.)
 10. Rensource Energy  $1,006,250
 Rensource allows qualifying companies throughout Nigeria and West Africa to start selling Power-as-a-Service (PaaS) to their customers. The startup raised $1 million in funding at the beginning of 2018 according to their SEC filing. It was not easy to establish the date when the company raised the amount given that the date when the startup made the sale is ahead of its date of signing. We, therefore, took this as an error on the document. Also, CB Insights algorithm also agreed with our decision. However, it is important to note that deals at the beginning or towards the end of the year/quarter are hard to allocate. We, therefore, try as much as possible to triple check. If you think we are wrong on this one, email research@digestafrica.com.
 11. Kopa Technologies  $1,700,000
 Kopa Technologies describes itself as a travel &amp; technology-based company stating Mauritius as its headquarters. Little is known about them except this merger notice [PDF] from the Fair Competition Commission of Tanzania after expressing interest in acquiring Kopagas Limited. The notice described them as close to a private equity firm. The Acquiring Firm is a recently incorporated company and it operates as a company that engages in acquisitions and managing subsidiaries that deal with distribution of gaseous fuels in emerging markets, it read. According to their SEC filings, Kopa Technologies raised $1.7 million in May last year  the exact amount they were looking for.
 12. SomaApps Technologies  $2,400,000
 The Tanzanian startup develops an app for high school students, current undergraduates, and graduate students to find scholarships. They also run SomaFit, which programs, designs and manufactures fitness trackers. In December 2018, we were informed that the startup closed $2.4 million in funding from an undisclosed investor. When we contacted Isaya Yunge, the CEO and Co-founder, he acknowledged the funding but declined to give any further details about the round.
 13. Names &amp; Faces  $3,077,503 + $120,000
 The Cape Town-based startup creates tools to help organizations build directories of their teams. In September last year, per their SEC filings, the startup closed $3.1 million from undisclosed investors. The startup was also selected to join Y Combinator and ended up securing $120,000 in seed funding.

"Research Brief: Africa-focused fund managers raised $1.094B in 2018
","Africas early stage and certain technology companies face the often life-threatening impediment of inadequate access to seed and early-stage funding. Fortunately, a number of developments that took place last year indicate that the trend is changing.
 Throughout 2018, according to the Digest Africa Index, 16 fund managers raised or committed funds through 20 deals from 60 investors. The total raised amounted to $1.094 billion with Naspers $314 million commitment coming off as the highest and MTN Ugandas commitment of $250,000 as the smallest. Amongst governments, only Rwanda and South Africa  across the continent  announced funds dedicated to either early stage or technology companies. The European Investment Bank was the most active Limited Partner, participating in five funds.
 
 Stage
 Early stage investment focused funds recorded the highest number of raises and commitments from 39 investors translating into $743.2 million in total funds raised which is 67.9% of the total. Some of the notable funds focused on early-stage investments are Naspers Foundry which is 30% of the $314 million that Naspers committed to investing in South Africa throughout 2019 as well as Africa Tech Ventures $17.5 million that it raised as part of its $50 million Seed stage focused fund. SunFunder’s $25 million that it raised as part of the $100 million Solar Energy Transformation Fund was the only debt-focused fund raised last year.
 
 Sector
 47.7% of the funds raised last year were geared towards investments into startups and high growth potential companies operating in any sector while 42.3% of the funds raised were tagged to technology companies.
 
 Top 10 Funds raised
 Naspers with its $314 million fund aimed at South African startups and strengthening of its existing businesses was the highest in 2018. According to the company, the fund “aims to fund and support South African technology startups seeking to address big societal needs”. 70% of that is aimed at the development of its existing technology businesses, including OLX, Takealot, and Mr D Food, which might include acquisitions to ensure the said company strengthen the market positions for the above businesses. While the remainder of the fund goes towards Naspers Foundry  the majority of those investments is focused on black-owned South African startups.
 
 Limited Partners
 There was a total of 60 limited partners that invested in funds focused on early-stage and technology companies across Africa. Though, the majority of these were development finance institution owned by governments like CDC Group, FMO and Proparco.
 European Investment Bank was the most active limited partners on the continent participating in investments into five (5) funds: Partech Africa Fund managed by Partech Ventures ($70M), Novastar II managed by Novastar Ventures ($72.5M), Tide Africa Fund managed by TLcom Capital ($40M), Sawari Ventures North Africa Fund I managed by Sawari Ventures ($35M) and Africa Tech Ventures ($10M).
 However, the African Development Bank was also among the notably active limited partners. The bank invested in a total of four (4) funds. The bank invested in a total of four (4) funds: Rwanda National Research and Innovation Fund ($30M), Africa Tech Ventures ($7.5M), Tide Africa Fund (managed by TLcom Capital Partners ($40M as a participant), Partech Africa Fund ($7M).
 Last year, the Board of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) approved the Bank’s Policy on Non-sovereign Operations (NSO), freeing them to make direct investments into non-state backed funds and ventures. According to AfDB, “the document provides the framework within which the Bank through its private sector lending window may provide financing or investment without sovereign guarantees to private and public entities that meet specific eligibility requirements on non-concessional terms”. In the end, three (3) of the funds that they invested in went to non-sovereign backed funds.
 Norfund, with support from IFU, Arsenault Family Foundation and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also launched a $10 million fund to focus on Somalia. Called The Nordic Horn of Africa Opportunities Fund, its primary investment instrument is set to be the Sharia-compliant “Murabaha” and the average deal size of $250,000.
 There were only two state-owned funds that were launched last year. These were; Rwanda Innovation Fund  which received a $30 million loan from the AfDB  as well as South Africas $140 million (R2B) Project Development Partnership Fund. The latter was established in partnership between the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), an entity of the Department of Labour.
 France, through the French Development Agency (AFD), launched a $76 million Africa Startup Fund in May last year. Emmanuel Macron, the French President pointed out that the fund is dedicated to providing access to small ticket funding for African startups, as part of the unveiling of a Digital Africa initiative. Proparco, a subsidiary of Agence Française de Développement (AFD) focused on private sector development, was appointed the fund manager. Though, a large chunk of the fund will be disbursed in form Proparco taking equity stakes and becoming a limited partner in VC funds. That is why Proparco appears as both a fund and a limited partner on the infographic.
 Notes
 Please note that we use the words raised and committed interchangeably to mean the same thing. We also took also investors in the funds as limited partners.

"Andela Officially Expands Operations to Uganda
","Andela launched officially in Uganda on 24th May, 2017 with offices located at The Innovation Village in Ntinda, Kampala.
 The company recruits the most talented developers on the African continent, shapes them into technical leaders, and places them as full-time distributed team members with companies that range from Microsoft and IBM to dozens of high-growth startups.
 Backed by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GV (Google Ventures) and Spark Capital, Andela is building the next generation of global technology leaders. Andela has offices in Lagos, Nairobi, New York and now in the capital of Uganda  Kampala.
 800 developers in Kampala  signed up for Andela after the first call for applications from which 8 were accepted into Andelas first ever cohort in Uganda. Operations have commenced in the Uganda fellowship and applications for the second Uganda cohort are currently open.
 Andela trains software developers for six months and then deploys them to tech companies around the world that need their skills. It places a high premium on vetting and has received over 60,000 applications since launch but only 0.7% of those have been accepted.
 According to recent research by Indeed, there will be 1.3 M jobs created for software developers over the next 10 years and only 400,000 domestic grads to fill them. To continue combating the tech talent shortage, Andela has resorted to using the African talent.
 Uganda, the second youngest country in the world with 70% of its population below the age of 25, has a couple of tech and innovation hubs spread throughout Kampala. Andela sees this as an opportunity to equip the next generation of technologist and innovators in Kampala with the expertise they need to accelerate the advancement of their communities through technology.

 It is thus safe to say that blockchain has the whole globe buzzing. And, every sector is moving to be the first to use this technology and reshape their sector.
 
 
 Transactions and trust
 
 
 You might know or heard someone talk about it. Or, you may know nothing. Blockchain is a complicated system to grasp. But the idea is simple.
 
 
  
 
 
 Through every transaction the most important element is trust. You see the item you want to buy, bring it to the cashier, they tell you the price, you pay and get your brand new item. A simple transaction filled with trust. Because? You were physically part of it and you know it happened. The cashier also knows it happened as he too was there and received the money in return. A trustworthy transaction.
 
 
  
 
 
 Now, bring this transaction online. You see something you want online, you buy it. Then what? You don’t have your brand new item in your hand. In fact, you can’t know where it is. 
 
 
  
 
 
 On the other side, how does the cashier know if you are who you say you are. Or, if the money was actually sent? Without a doubt, online purchases are filled with uncertainties. Yet that is why we have a third party actor. A middleman acting as the mediator to ensure safe and secure transactions online. But this middleman comes at a price. 
 
 
  
 
 
 A typical online transaction using a card goes through six intermediaries. Before the payment reaches the sellers bank account. The payment request from the merchant goes through an aggregator, like Authorize.net. Who sends a request to the card network like Visa. Visa initiates a payment request from the buyers bank which issued the card. Another intermediary is responsible to settle the transfer from the sellers bank and the buyers bank. The actual transfer of money can take several days. Each one of these intermediaries take a cut of the transaction amount.
 
 
  
 
 
 The third party will charge for their services. And, will take something of the total price  a transaction cost. Meaning every time you buy something online, a book, stocks or airfare, you will also pay the mediator. 
 
 
  
 
 
 So, why not have a system that is as trustworthy as a real-life transaction? Like the one where you are in the store, but online?
 
 
 Bring in Blockchain
 
 
 The appeal of digital ledger software is that it takes out the third party. Thus removes the transaction cost. Through its participants, a blockchain system can confirm all transactions within the network. The participants being a connection point for all the networks that are part of the system. And, have an identical copy of the entire ledger.
 
 
  
 
 
 In the online shopper scenario, the payment transaction initiated by the buyer will result in a direct debit to the buyer’s account. Followed by a direct credit to the sellers account in the digital ledger. There are no intermediaries. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Each transaction will be processed by the participants. And, as soon as the majority of participants confirm the transaction, it is added to the digital ledger for good. This creates a system that is hard to cheat as everything is recorded by everybody. 
 
 
  
 
 
 A participant cannot sell a product twice. As the system will recognize the earlier transaction. Likewise, the same value cannot be sent twice, as it too is recorded. Thus creating a safe and transparent system.
 
 
  
 
 
 Furthermore, removing the third party allows for transactions to be more efficient. Many settlements can take days to confirm which creates costs. Taking away the intermediate that has to make phone calls, negotiate, check credit etc., a distributed electronic ledger software will save both time and money.
 
 
  
 
 
 Most commonly the blockchain system has been associated with money transactions. But, another favorable attribute to this system is that it can work for all sorts of “transactions”. Whether it is money, identity records, real estate ownership, car leasing or company licenses. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Though other sectors are moving to put in place blockchain, it is the banking sector that has a lot to enjoy this system. The blockchain system has already been tried and succeeded when it comes to money transactions. Bitcoin, the most used, is a form of digital currency based on blockchain technology. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Computer manufacturers Dell and overstock.com have about 20 percent of the payments through Bitcoin. So what does this mean for the banking sector in Uganda?
 
 
  
 
 
 In Uganda, the telecom (telco) have given the banking sector a run for their money. With mobile payment systems. More than half the population has access to a mobile phone. Thus money transactions can easily happen without having a bank account. Therefore, what might have been a threat to the banking sector is actually a door of opportunity.
 
 
  
 
 
 Worldwide the banking sector has been at a standstill. While new innovations and platforms are created daily thanks to technology. Now, the blockchain system has the whole sector buzzing. Major banks, such as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Barclays, are taking the much-needed initiative. Exploring how Blockchain can be used to better their systems and better compete in a mobile world.
 
 
  
 
 
 A blockchain system offers a great opportunity to save time in all parts of a transaction. Something that would greatly benefit the banks in Uganda. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Today, if someone wanted to move money from their bank account to their mobile money account, there are three different systems that must record this transaction. First, the bank has to update its ledger. 
 
 
  
 
 
 To access the telco mobile money system about this transaction, the bank has to go through an intermediary “aggregator”. Who has to record this transaction in their ledger as well. The intermediary will then request for this transaction to be recorded into the telco’s mobile money ledger system. 
 
 
  
 
 
 One transaction results in three different ledgers affected. Which leads to a long stray of delays and security vulnerabilities. As the transaction is propagated between the different entities. And, of course, accounting bottlenecks resulting from incomplete transactions at any one stage of the transaction. The latter can cause settlement and reconciliation to be an operational pain. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Today it’s common for banks, Telco’s, and other institutions to maintain suspense accounts. These hold billions of unsettled funds. This happens when the bank initiates a payment to a recipient e.g. Umeme on behalf of its customer electronically. If the recipient does not confirm receipt of this payment to the banking platform for whatever reason, the transaction will be considered incomplete. Therefore will be left in a suspense mode until settlement and reconciliation are complete. 
 
 
  
 
 
 This is very common since systems lose connectivity, servers malfunction and so forth. Very many times the systems banks are using are not built to manage these potential outcomes.
 
 
  
 
 
 With a blockchain system, the transaction is recorded once and cannot be changed  ever. Any changes get recorded as blocks of new transactions. All subscribing entities to the platform are informed  in real time of the transaction. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The blockchain ledger is maintained by a network of computers  which all have a copy of all transactions. These computers will primarily be connected to each other over the internet. This means that a request to add a transaction must be accepted by all other participating computers. Which makes it hard to manipulate by one single person. 
 
 
  
 
 
 In practice, this means that a couple of financial institutions would be nominated to host the different nodes belonging to this network of computers and the rest i.e. utility companies like Umeme, National Water, and Sewerage Cooperation, small and large businesses, NGOs, SACCOS, Microfinance institutions, etc. will just be users. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Participants can move money from a bank account to a mobile money account and vice-versa. Regardless of telco network or bank. This gives mobile money users access to banks accounts and vice-versa. Which gives banks access to the millions of “unbanked” consumers that banks have been “drooling” about. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The telcos have a lot to gain as well. Some of their mobile money customers collect part of their revenues through the mobile money system. But, they have to pay suppliers with cheques or electronic transfers. Other customers, especially individuals, might want to enjoy the benefits that mobile money brings. Like a large agent network distributed across most parts of the country. To these customers, these agents are like ATMs. The customer moves their money from their bank account to their mobile money account and all of a sudden there is an endless supply of agents where cash can be withdrawn.
 
 
 
 Figure 1
 
 
 
 Figure 1: Using distributed digital ledgers like blockchain, banks and mobile network operators can all be participants in one distributed digital ledger that is transparent to all. This allows several possibilities to like instant transfer of funds from one bank to another or from one bank to a mobile money account
 
 
 For the banking sector in Uganda changing from a paper based system to a fully digital one can seem as a scary undertaking. However, once the concerns are addressed there is no reason why Uganda can’t be a first mover. For better and more efficient banking systems.
 
  
 
 
 Security is a major factor when talking about one platform that will store all transaction information between parties. But, a blockchain system has a major security factor in its favour as there is no human element part of this system. Each transaction will be processed and confirmed through trusted connection points (nodes) with no human interference necessary. This means that no one actor can exploit vulnerable information and manipulate the system.
 
 
  
 
 
 Besides removing the human element from the process, there will be more transparency within the banking sector. Though the system is based on an open source platform, it can be tailored for each specific bank. Allowing them to protect not only their client’s private information but also their own. Without physically having to do it. No files will be hidden or lost yet they are still safe and private.
 
 
 The future of Banking
 
 
 Blockchain and digital ledger systems like it will change every sector that has transactions. Whether it is banking, finance, real-estate, retail or insurance. In fact, it has already started. Even so, there is still a way to go before such a system is fully operational and can be implemented into each sector.
 
 
  
 
 
 The important thing is that there is no reason the banking sector in Uganda can’t join the efforts. To revolutionize its banking systems. Especially with qualified software companies easily available locally, and ready to be their partner in a brave new world of global banking technologies.

"African Startups That Have Raised At Least $20M In A Single VC Round
","Last year, the US recorded over $100 billion in venture capital investment according to CB Insights report while Africa only recorded less than $1 billion per Digest Africa data. Yet, although there is still a huge gap between venture capital investment into Africa and other parts of the world, particularly the West, one can’t fail to notice that the former is on an upwards trajectory. It is also worth noting that the ticket sizes for both early venture and late venture rounds are getting bigger on average.
 In this research brief, we take a look at the biggest VC rounds recorded by African startups (companies founded not more than 10 years ago) with a focus on rounds that are at least $20 million  which we are referring to as mega-rounds in this brief. Please note that we excluded rounds raised by companies that were founded before 2009.
 In cases where a company raised a single round through multiple tranches i.e Series A-I and Series A-II  like Flutterwave and Paga  we combined the two to form a single round. We have also relied mostly on information that was made public for this brief.
 For Jumia’s funding, we relied on data available through CrunchBase, though we classified the $150 million they raised in 2014 as a Pre-Series C instead of Series C as CrunchBase states. We excluded all investments made into Takealot by Naspers (valued at over $100 million) as most of it can be classified as Strategic Investments that led to the acquisition of the company. We therefore only considered the $100 million Series C round that they raised from Tiger Global Management.
 All currencies were converted to USD using the Bloomberg Currency Converter and adjusted for the rates at the time they were announced. To understand more about our classifications, read our methodology.
 Summary
 There are at least 12 companies  founded in the past 10 years  that have raised at least one mega round in their lifetime. These 12 have raised a combined 18 mega-rounds with a total value of $1.3 billion from Series A through to Series D.
 Jumia Group was the first African startup to raise a mega-round with a $45 million Series A in 2012 while Andela is the latest with $100 million Series D that it announced in January 2019. Jumia Group dominates the list of the most mega-rounds raised with its $400 million Series C, $150 million Pre-Series C and $150 million Series B. South African e-commerce giant Takealot  which Naspers acquired last year  as well as Andela close off the top five with $100 million each in Series C and Series D funding respectively.
 
 E-commerce dominated the first half of the decade with Jumia, Zando, Konga and Takealot bringing in the bulk of mega-rounds. However, the latest darling for investors is fintech. In 2018, financial technology companies recorded three (3) of the five (5) mega-rounds. The year also recorded the highest venture capital deal for a fintech with Jumo’s $52 million led by Goldman Sachs. However, financial technology pales in comparison to the funding that e-commerce has attracted over time especially Jumia’s $400 million Series C.
 There has also been a growing number of investors per round from an average of two (2) in 2012 to nine (9) in 2018. Flutterwave’s $20 million Series A  that it raised across two (2) tranches  has so far recorded the highest number of participants per round with 12. Nigeria dominates the list of the most number of mega-rounds raised with 11 recorded by six different startups.
 Over the years
 The first time an African startup raised a mega-round was in 2012 when Jumia raised a $45 million Series A from Blakeney Management, Rocket Internet and Millicom Systems. Since then, the number of mega-rounds has been on a gradual upward trend. One can not afford to ignore Jumia Group’s (formerly Africa Internet Group) influence on this trend. In each of the years that they have raised capital, the company has pulled off the largest rounds; $45 million (2012), $150 million (2013), $150 million (2014) and $400 million (2016).
 Jumia Group’s $400 million Series C raised in 2016 that was led by both MTN Group and Rocket Internet still ranks as the highest venture capital round ever recorded by an African startup in the past 10 years. This is closely followed by both Jumia’s Series B and Pre-Series C that were at $150 million each raised in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Takealot’s $100 million Series C, as well as Andela’s $100 million Series D that they each raised in 2014 and 2019, respectively round off the top five.
 Also read: YC startups in Africa have raised over $58.3M in total follow-on funding
 When you look at the graph below, it seems like the size of the mega-rounds is on a decline. However, when you take out Jumia’s rounds, the data shows that on average both the number of mega-rounds and average size per round is on an upward trend. Over the past ten years, 2018 recorded the highest number of mega-rounds  with five (5) with an average amount per mega-round of $30 million.
 These included; Flutterwave’s close of Series A at $20 million, Paga’s close of its Series B at $23 million, Jumo’s $52 million Goldman Sachs led Series C, Zola Electric’s $55 million Series D as well as Swvl’s Series B that was estimated to be at least $30 million. In 2019, Andela is the first and only company (so far) to raise a mega-round with a $100 million Series D.
 In comparison to other years, 2017 recorded only one (1) mega-round while 2016 recorded only two (2) mega-rounds and 2015 recorded only three (3) mega-rounds. In 2019, one (1) mega-round has been recorded so far with Andela raising $100 million in Series D funding.
 
 Sector
 From 2012 to 2015, E-commerce was the undeniable king of pulling in mega-rounds  thanks to Jumia Group, Zando, Takealot and Konga. Amongst the four  in a period of three years  over $855 million was raised in 8 different mega-rounds. (Zando is another e-commerce player that pulled in a mega-round in that period, although  according to Rocket Internet  the venture is treated as a South African subsidiary of Jumia Group)
 All the above e-commerce players have either achieved an exit or actively seeking one. Takealot was finally acquired by Naspers in 2018 while Konga was also acquired by Zinox Technologies and merged with its off-line operations of Yudala. Though, there are speculations that the e-commerce player might list either on the New York Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange before the close of 2020. It has also been reported that Jumia Group might also list before the close of 2019 as MTN Group  the venture’s majority stakeholder  seeks an exit.
 Over time, e-commerce has lost its position as the sector which attracts mega-rounds to the financial technology sector. Although financial technology companies haven’t raised funding in the figures to the tune of Konga, Jumia and Takealot, the sector’s number of mega-rounds has been steadily growing both in magnitude and frequency. Last year, of the five mega-rounds, three involved financial services companies; Flutterwave ($20 million), Paga ($23 million) and Jumo ($52 million).
 However, e-commerce, although with declining influence, still holds the biggest mega-rounds recorded; Jumia’s $400 million Series C, for example, is the biggest round ever recorded by a company founded in the past 10 years. To date, Jumo’s $52 million is the biggest VC funding for any financial technology startup across Africa while Zola Electric’s $55 million Series D is the largest for an Energy company. Swvl’s $30 million Series B is the largest for a transport and logistics startup.
 
 Country
 Nigeria has the highest number of mega-rounds with 11 of the 18 recorded. This is because the country  per our classification  is home to companies like Andela, Jumia and Konga who have each raised at least two mega-rounds. (It is important to note that, according to reports from Rocket Internet, Zando is taken as a Jumia Group subsidiary though run independently).
 One would expect Kenya to make an appearance on the list due to big names like M-Kopa as well as Cellulant. However, most of the funding that M-Kopa has raised over the past 10 years hasn’t been through venture capital while Cellulant falls outside the criteria of companies that were founded not more than 10 years ago as it was founded in 2004.
 
 Funding Rounds
 Jumia has the record for the biggest mega-round for each round from Series A to Series C. The e-commerce giant was the first to raise a mega-round with its $45 million Series A in 2012. To date, this is the biggest Series A round raised by an African startup while its $150 million Series B is the highest Series B round and its $400 million Series C is the highest Series C. Andela, which raised $100 million Series D early this year holds the record for the highest Series D round, although Jumia’s Series C dwarfs it.
 
 Investors per round
 The number of investors involved in each mega-round has been steadily growing over time. In 2012, there was an average of two investors per round. This figure rose to an average of nine (9) investors per funding round by close of 2018. Flutterwave’s $20 million Series A that it raised across two different tranches has the highest number of investors with 12. This reflects can be a reflection of two things; the growing interest of VCs into the continent or a lack of sufficient deals leading to overcrowding in the few that are existent.
 
 Year Founded
 Most of the companies that have raised funding were founded in 2012 (four) followed by those that were founded in 2014 (two). What this implies is that it is becoming easier for non-e-commerce companies to raise funding.

 3. South Africa Proposes Draft for Cryptocurrency Tax
 The South Africa Revenue Service (SARS) has put forward a suggestion to tax income generated from cryptocurrency trading and operations. Cryptocurrencies will continue to be treated as intangible assets and thus will continue to be subject to income tax.
 This means that South Africans will have to declare their cryptocurrency profits and/or losses when they declare their taxable income.
 Interestingly, South Africans welcomed this move as it assured them of government support in the use of cryptocurrencies, the opposite of what other African countries have been doing.

 4. Opera plans to add a cryptocurrency wallet to its desktop browser
 Opera becomes the first major desktop browser to include a cryptocurrency wallet, negating the need for third-party extensions or applications.
 The desktop wallet (which supports Ethereum, its tokens, and collectibles) synchronizes with the cryptocurrency wallet integrated into the Android version of Opera since June of this year.
 When a user wishes to send a payment, they sign transactions using their phone’s built-in fingerprint reader, rather than typing out a long passphrase.

"STUDY: Mobile Money Users Save 19.5 Million Hours a Month
","A recent study carried out by the Digital Impact Awards Africa (DIAA) revealed that at least 5,000,000 regular users of mobile financial services in Uganda during a 3 months period spent 7,113,356 man hours (296,390 man days) to clear simple financial transactions and saved 57,989,660 productive hours (An average of 19.5 million hours a month) that would otherwise be spent on using traditional transactions payment means.
 While releasing this study results, Innocent Kawooya, CEO of HiPipo noted that
 “The growth of mobile financial services, digital business and the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to attract large investment in Africa by 2020” He added that, Whereas leaders have always  got down to discuss high profile topics such as climate change, security, and trade,  digital driven financial inclusion should take the podium now since it  is one of the things that will drive Africa’s prosperity by saving Africans a lot of productive time while performing many important but basic transactions.
 The simple financial transactions include; Transfer (P2P): Person to Person Transfers, Transfer to Voucher (P2C): Transfer with voucher to someone not having mobile phone, Airtime Purchases by Subscriber: Purchases of airtime on personal phones via mobile money, Airtime Sales by Agent: i.e. airtime purchases done via a mobile money agent and Bill Payments: e.g. Utilities (Water, Electricity), Pay TV, Taxes, School Fees, online payments, travel, betting etc.
 
 “When people make more use of mobile financial service, two things are bound to happen. First, they manage money more effectively – with new ways to save, make payments, access credit, or obtain insurance. Second, they spend less time taking care of simple financial transactions and concentrate more on productive work or running extra income generating businesses on their own.” Innocent Kawooya noted.
 
 Moreover, additional earnings and savings boost these people’s resilience against financial shocks resulting from, say, an unexpected therapeutic expenses, delayed wage payments or a seasonal crop failure.
 In Asia/Pacific, 44 percent of consumers use mobile shopping apps, the highest in the world. However, their purchase conversion rate using mobile apps remains low at only 1.27 percent, dwarfed by the 3.45 percent conversion rate with desktop PCs, according to Gartner, Inc.  However, the DIAA study notes that with more innovative use on mobile financial services, more success will be registered in Africa.
 One person who used all these mobile money enabled simple financial transactions saved 3 hours and 2 minutes in a day, whereas, averagely, each of the 5,000,000 users saved at least 12 productive hours on such transactions within three months. The Digital Impact Awards Africa (DIAA) study further revealed.
 At least 110,928,097 million simple financial transactions were successfully executed in a period of three months. It should be noted that, using traditional means as a substitute for these simple transaction payments such as buying scratch cards to load airtime, lining up at energy offices, in banks to pay school fees and water agencies to pay monthly bills, a minimum of 65,103,015 hours (2,712,626 days) would be needed by 5,000,000 people for the same period.
 Thanks to various digital and mobile money innovations, there is great room to improve on financial empowerment cultures such as saving, investment and insurance through the use of simple mobile financial services, and further exploring the full potential of digital financial inclusion.
 In Kenya, for example, M-Pesa has helped an estimated 204,000 households escape extreme poverty. The breakthrough there is driven by changes in savings behavior and greater occupational choice, especially for women making use of mobile financial savings tools.
 This DIAA study further found out that, over 7,041,465 simple transaction payments for bills such as Utilities took 469,431 hours for mobile money users unlike the 10,562,197 hours ordinary processes such as traveling to lineup to division bills’ payment offices would require.
 As more African countries make use of mobile and digital financial services, the prospects for lasting economic growth improve dramatically. One recent survey projected that broadening access to digital financial services would increase developing African countries’ GDP by an estimated $3.7 trillion by 2025.
 Commenting about the Digital Impact Award Africa findings, the project patron Hon. Karubanga David (State Minister for Public Service and Member of Parliament for Kigorobya) noted that “With more people getting financially included using digital financial services, Uganda and the rest of Africa will see more productivity and this would be reflected in a steady growing Gross Domestic Product.”

"Why other African governments need to adopt Tunisia&#8217;s startup act
","According to the 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Index, Tunisia has a relatively healthy business and startup ecosystem. Given it ranks 6th and 40th in MENA and worldwide respectively. Other African countries in the top 60 included Botswana, South Africa and Namibia at 52, 57 and 60 respectively.
 To ensure the country became more business and startup friendly, last month, the Tunisian parliament stunned the world when they approved a startup act. This will guarantee grants, tax exemptions and government incentives to businesses that qualify as start-ups.
 The long-term objective of all this is to inspire young people to chase innovative business ventures and drive progress in the science and technology sectors.
 The act clearly stipulates that for any company to be a startup, it needs to not have existed more than eight years ago, the majority (two-thirds) shareholders are founders, hedge fund investors or angel investors. The startups should also preferably have a technologically based business model and its operations encompass the use of new cutting age technologies as their core.
 With this new act, the government of Tunisia is trying to move away from the traditional dependency on Tourism and Agriculture as a major source of revenue. Putting science, innovations, and Technology in order to boost the country’s economic transformation.
 As it is now, apart from Tunisia, one cant identify an African country thats making itself more startup friendly. What has been witnessed in most cases are knee-jerk reactions.
 For example, recently, the Ugandan government came out to reward a few startups. Yet, many argued that instead of doing this, why not focus on creating an environment that wont necessitate them running to the government all the time?
 
 Instead of government picking winners, it should create an environment for [innovators] to equitably access capital to build their innovations, Ck Japheth, Founder, The Innovation Village in Kampala
 
 This is a testament that few governments go a step further to craft something that has an objective of creating a long-term positive impact on their economies.
 Despite access to funding being among the pressing challenges for a couple of African startups, few countries have put in place in place lasting solutions. An example is Nigeria. Taken as one of the countries with the most vibrant tech startup ecosystems across Africa, crowdfunding for startups is still illegal.
 In Tanzania and Uganda, running online businesses  especially those focused on media and publications  is likely to become harder. One will be required to pay the Tanzanian government over US $900. Making it harder for those looking to start businesses in that field.
 While, the Ugandan government is now mandating all those doing online media and publication to register with its communications authority, UCC. A move many have viewed as the initial step towards Tanzanias direction of levying fees on them. On top of what they already pay as trading licenses.
 Uganda is also exploring the possibility of charging its social media users a daily fee of UGx. 100 (US $0.03). Yet, according to a report released early this year, Facebook and other social networking platforms are becoming a channel many small businesses rely on to reach customers. Such a move would curtail their growth.
 When you look at the figures of investment into African (technology) startups, the future is promising. Last year, the figure grew by over 53% to US $560 Million. According to Partech Ventures Cyrill Collon, it is likely to grow past US $1 Billion annually by 2020. A significant addition to the African economy.
 &nbsp;
 Additionally, the African continent is considered to be the youngest in the entire world. With the median age estimated to be 19.5 years. But grappling with unemployment. Tony Elumelu pointed out youth unemployment as Africas greatest challenge.
 Yet, according to the Atlantic, startups tend to have more people in their early- and mid-20s. Adding that more than half of startup employees are below 30, compared to 42 percent at non-startups.
 Startups provide an alternative source of employment for the young educated masses of Africa. Ride-hailing services such as Safeboda, UberBoda, Taxify have provided employment to over 6000 Bodaboda riders in Kampala, Uganda, alone.
 Technology and accelerator hubs have sprung up across Africa and many credit them for the spike in the number of (technology) startups across the continent. But, these hubs are mainly donor funded.
 Its therefore important that African governments find a way of creating a conducive environment that will allow several (technology) startups to mushroom. There needs to be a move away from knee-jerk reactions to better thought out solutions. Hence the need to adopt a similar approach like Tunisia.
 African governments must, therefore, aim at establishing enabling environments where investors, entrepreneurs, and other startup enablers can thrive. For example, African governments need to have policies that enable investors in startups to receive tax deductions if the company fails.
 They can also explore the possibility of setting up funds to match investments into any startups. Say, if a foreigner invests in a local startup, the government matches it by 50%. If the local does so, it matches the investment by 100%.

"Building a more sustainable and better Digest Africa for you
","Hi all,
 I would like to thank you for being a part of Digest Africa. Some of you have been with us from the very start  on March 1, 2017, while others have joined us along the way.
 We started Digest Africa (as Startup Digest Africa) close to two years ago with the goal of organizing data and information about Africas technology companies. During the same period, we have unsuccessfully experimented with multiple ways that we thought would enable us to achieve the vision sustainably. In the end, we had to abandon most of them as they did not fit into our objectives as a company.
 Since founding Digest Africa, one thing remained clear to us  we never wanted a business model that compromises the quality of what we offer. That is why we put so much emphasis on a business model that would contribute to our vision both in the short and long-run. We, therefore, decided that we would only generate revenue in a way that incentivizes to constantly improve the product itself.
 I am therefore happy and confident to announce that  in a bid to serve you better  we are introducing Digest Africa Subscription Packages as a way to allow you to continue enjoying our products as well as guarantee sustainability on our end. We shall roll out the packages over the course of the coming 11 months starting with February 2019.
 The packages are; Basic and Premium (for now) as well as Corporate (later). Below is the description of the packages that we shall launch in Q1.
 1. Basic Plan  $49/month (billed monthly)
 We shall launch the basic plan on February 01, 2019. The target is founders, investors or corporates who are looking at keeping an eye on Africas high-growth early stage tech companies on an individual basis. With the package, you will be able to get access to;
 
 Exclusive articles: Overtime, we have built a reputation for digging deeper for stories that you are not likely to find anywhere else. We also break most of the stories about funding thanks to our automated tracking systems.
 Advanced Filters: We are building the most abundant resource of technology companies, investors and accelerators across Africa as well as the deals they are involved in. With our advanced filters, you will be able to navigate the above seamlessly.
 Weekly Research Briefs: We recently introduced a new segment called Digest Africa Research Briefs.

Overtime, which is in the near future, we shall look at releasing multiple research briefs a week.
 Unlimited Access to Deals: Africas technology space is witnessing more deal activity than ever before which has, in the end, made it harder for one to keep an eye on each and every one of them. With our deals section, youre able to find out about the deals as they happen or even catch up later.
 Unlimited Access to Database: As pointed out, we are building the most abundant database of companies, investors and accelerators. We also ensure that the data is not only up-to-date but complete. Currently, we have over 1000+ deals by 1000+ early-stage companies across Africa. We also have data about 250+ investors and 50+ accelerators.
 Monthly Funding Summary: Given that we track deals in realtime, we have the ability to quickly summarize the activities on a monthly basis. You will have access to this summary.
 
 2. Premium  $499/month (billed monthly)
 The premium package is targeted toward researchers, journalists, investors and corporates who are seeking a more in-depth understanding of Africas high growth early-stage companies as well as those backing them. This package will go live in March 2019 and will carry along the following benefits  on top of those at the Basic Plan Level;
 
 Tracking Panel: You always want to separate the signal from the noise. The tracking panel will allow you to keep an eye on what matters to you in terms of activities relating to companies, deals and investors.
 Customized Feed: The ultimate goal is to turn our feed into the homepage for all stories about Africas technology space. Yet, with the customized feed, you are able to only have stories about topics that interest you.
 Data Export: After using filters, you can export your data to Excel, CSV or Google Sheets to carry out your own analysis.
 Monthly Reports: We are looking at giving an in-depth understanding of Africas technology space by releasing a report once a month focused on different topics. As a premium subscriber, you will access each of those reports at no extra cost.
 
 Although we have introduced the above packages, it doesnt mean that you wont be able to access Digest Africa at all unless youre a paid up member. Some of the brief articles as well as press releases will be available to all Digest Africa users  paid or not. You will also be able to access our free weekly newsletter and the top 10 latest deals.
 We hope that you will join us on this journey and contribute to organizing information and data about Africas early stage and technology companies.
 Sincerely,
 Pk Malinz, Co-founder &amp; CEO

"Investisseurs &#038; Partenaires Announces Final Closing For €75M Africa Fund
","The Investisseurs &amp; Partenaires (I&amp;P) impact investment group, dedicated to African small and medium-sized companies, completed the interim closing of the I&amp;P Afrique Entrepreneurs 2 (IPAE 2) fund, enabling it to reach a total amount of 75 million euros.
 To date, IPAE 2 has invested in four SMEs and aims to support more than thirty companies in sub-Saharan Africa by 2022. IPAE 2 is following the IPAE 1 fund, which has invested in 29 African companies and which has recently announced two exits [FRENCH].
 I &amp; P Afrique Entrepreneurs 2 was launched in December 2017 with the first closing of 50 million euros.
 The second closing amounted to 25 million euros and allows several well-known investors to join the fund, including the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO), the Stichting fondsbeheer DGGF lokaal MKB, Bpifrance, Crédit Coopératif, FPS Mirova Solidaire or the World Bank through the private sector window of the International Association for Development (IDA).
 The IPAE 2 fund brings together a diverse panel of investors, including public investors (IFC, PROPARCO, European Investment Bank, BIO, DGGF, Bpifrance ), private and corporate investors (AXA Impact Fund, Société Générale ), as well as several family offices and foundations.

 IPAE 2 is on track to reach its target size of between €80 and €90 million and will complete a third and final closing by the end of the first half of 2019. It is now one of the largest more critical in the field of impact funds dedicated to African SMEs. While the latter are increasingly identified as essential players for inclusive growth on the continent, they still face many obstacles, including access to finance and skills.
 I &amp; P has also raised a technical assistance budget from several of its public investors of € 2.9 million, which will complete the support provided by the team through the performance of expert missions in the fields of activity of the company or on the social, environmental and governance levels.
 IPAE 2 aims to invest in equity and quasi-equity in the minority in 30 to 40 startups and companies located in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean, thus continuing the mission of the Investors &amp; Partners group to promote a new generation of entrepreneurs African. The investment team dedicated to IPAE has around ten members, based in Paris and six African offices (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Madagascar and Senegal).
 The fund has already invested in four African SMEs, operating in a wide range of sectors: Afribon, specialized in the development, production and marketing of food flavorings, the African Management Initiative (AMI), specialized in the professional training of African entrepreneurs and managers, CoinAfrique, a 100% mobile community classifieds platform and PROCRÉA, an Ivorian clinic specializing in the field of reproductive health.

"Here&#8217;s what ICTAU and PSFU proposed to parliament before OTT and Mobile Money taxes came into effect
","
 
 Yesterday, the Daily Monitor ran a story indicating that mobile money transactions in Uganda have dropped by 60% in 5 days. Thats from when the 1% tax on mobile money came in effect.
 Yet, this shouldn’t surprise us. Thats according to a submission made by ICTAU and PSFU to the Parliamentary Finance Committee in May.
 “Together with the ICT Committee of the Private Sector Foundation, the ICT Association of Uganda (ICTAU) presented the private sector position on the taxes that had at that time been proposed, including mobile money and OTT services.”
 
 Mobile Money is at a record drop of 60% country-wide in just 5 days of enacting the #MobileMoneyTax pic.twitter.com/8fafySxMpS
 — Evelyn Namara (@enamara) July 5, 2018
 
 In a presentation to the committee, that has since been compiled into a 7-page document [PDF], the two pointed out the likely consequence of the tax. Together with the tax on OTTs, now dubbed the social media tax.
 They pointed out that the “tax burden on the telecom sector is already high. Thus, “any increase in taxation will discourage consumption. This would definitely stifle growth hence reducing revenue to Government.
 The document pointed out that around “35% of the [telecom] industry revenue is paid to the government in taxes translating to about UGx. 1 Trillion.”

 Both ICTAU and PSFU proceeded to make recommendations on the way forward.
 Among these was encouraging “growth in penetration. This, they argued, would result in growth in Industry Revenue. Which, automatically, would increase taxes to the government.”
 They also recommended fair taxation of all banking financial services for fairness.
 All banking financial services should be taxed at the same rate as Mobile Money to ensure non-discriminatory taxation of financial services.”
 The general conclusion was that taxes on the digital financial services should be revised. Thats if theres to be an increased uptake in the above services.
 “Our call is on the Authorities to not only consider reduce the taxation on digital financial services but devise means of promoting usage of the service hence converting the over 40% of the dormant base of registered users to effectively use the service from which additional tax collection shall be tapped.
 Ever since the taxes came into effect, only ICTAU  of the two  has come out to issue a statement [PDF]. It expressed concern about the negative impact they might have on the economy.
 “The ICT Association of Uganda (ICTAU) is gravely concerned about the recently implemented taxes on Mobile Money and Over-The-Top (OTT) services,” read the statement.
 “These taxes were enacted by the Government of Uganda without sufficient deliberation or consultation and are not supported by evidence-based research. They will undoubtedly constrain the development of our industry, economy, and society.”

"Jumia Food clones Uber Eats with its latest web and mobile app look
","Rocket Internet owned food delivery company, Jumia Food, recently rolled out a new outlook. That is for both their website and mobile apps for iOS and Android.
 According to Timothy Mugume, the recently appointed Jumia Food Country Manager for Uganda, the new look is for the entire continent.
 This, he told me, was was part of the plan for continuous improvement, geared towards improved customer experience.
 The new look is very visual. And Timothy believes that the customers can [now] get a real feel of the dishes because food is very visual.
 Yet, when you take a close look at both the web and mobile looks of Jumia food and Uber Eats, theres little difference.
 A screenshot of Uber Eats website
 Jumia Food has adopted the minimalist and very visual outlook that Uber Eats has. Although Jumia Foods platform is a little bit more crowded and zoomed out.
 Plus, Uber Eats only has an option for entering your delivery address. Jumia Food instead asks you to enter your City and a subset of that city in a section that asks you to select your area.
 When you look to the top right corner, youll also notice that Jumia Food also placed its signing in and register buttons together with a Help button. Though they are bundled together and Uber Eats are separated.

 Substantial differences only kick in when you start scrolling down. The same similarities apply to the two when you check out their mobile.
 But, this shouldnt be surprising if you have followed Rocket Internets journey. Cloning is at the center of the Germany-based incubators model.
 In 2015, while giving a speech at Disrupt London, Oliver Samwer, co-founder of Rocket Internet, talked about the cloning culture that has come to define the company.
 Oliver argued that entrepreneurship is a holistic endeavor — involving many more tricky pieces than just having a good idea according to TechCrunch.
 If you look at entrepreneurship one piece is the idea. But to get it done and to get it done in a sustainable way I think is a very different one,” he told the Disrupt London audience.
 
 “If you look at emerging markets if this were easy just go and recreate Nigerian Amazon. Or just go to Indonesia and recreate Brightcove. Or go to Myanmar and create Booking.com. Then I think a lot of people would have done it.”
 
 CB Insights compiled a list of companies and products that Rocket Internet has cloned and compared their performance. This includes Airbnb, Uber, Stripe, Blue Apron and more.

"WorldRemit is monitoring the potential use of blockchain
","WorldRemit, a London-based money transfer company, is looking to experiment with a couple of new technology. That is according to Catherine Wines, a co-founder, and director. She revealed this while speaking to a group of technology entrepreneurs at The Innovation Village in Kampala, Uganda.
 “We are working on a number of things but I can’t tell you too much,” Catherine started. Before pointing out that among the things they are looking at, blockchain is one of them. “We are monitoring this area but not doing anything for the moment,” she said.
 According to Catherine, their line of business – remittances – requires them to have a lot of working capital. But, much of this goes to anchoring transfers their users make.
 “When you make a transfer, we can not access that money after a day or two,” she said. This is due to the fact that there’s a settlement period, especially with banks before they can access the money. Yet, they have to ensure that the cash is available on the other side instantly.
 “One of our biggest challenges is that we have to send money around the world, sometimes every day, to the various partners,” she says. This is to “make sure that there’s money there so that when you click confirm, the money is there to be paid.”
 Also read: After 15 years in Silicon Valley, Mark Karake is back to accelerate Kenyan startups
 Additionally, the entire process – according to Catherine – is currently plagued with high fees. These, ultimately, are transferred to the end user which makes the service a little bit more expensive than it could be.
 “The banking sector makes an awful job of it and it is expensive,” she pointed out. Yet, they still have to use the banks. “We have to use SWIFT and the banking sector is expensive, it takes time. and there are lots of charges.”
 That’s where she thinks that blockchain technology can be used. From making transfers instant to bringing down their working capital as well as the transfer fees. “[We could] make our transfers immediate, the fees would reduce and we can pass the savings to our customers.”
 Yet, even with all the potential of what the technology can do, there’s still a couple of challenges they will have to overcome. One of them; regulation. “I am sure you differentiate between blockchain and cryptocurrencies,” she started, “but unfortunately, the man in the street and the regulator don’t.”
 And that is true. In many countries, regulators and a significant segment of society think blockchain and crypto are the same things.
 But, even when they are able to convince the regulators, they can not do away with the banks and other players. “We would have to onboard banks at both ends,” she said.
 That is not likely to be an easy feat. Especially if it is likely to eat into their fees. Most of these businesses are built to capitalize on the inefficiencies in the value chain. “This type of technology is not yet fully accepted,” she pointed out, “there’s a jurisdiction that accepts it and a jurisdiction that outlaws it.”
 Also read: The making of Brenda Katwesigye, founder and CEO of Wazi Vision
 WorldRemit can now allow people from 50+ countries to send money. While people in over 150 countries across the globe can receive money using the service. Yet, the amount of work they had to do to onboard most of the regulators from across the globe is unimaginable.
 For example, they had to apply for a license from each of the 50 states in the US. While, in Malaysia, they could not operate because of the way KYC had to be carried out. “Before in Malaysia, you could only do face to face KYC. They didn’t allow anything online, so obviously you were not able to set up in Malaysia.”
 In South Africa, the government is requiring the company to set up servers in the country. A procedure that is costly on its own. Yet, she thinks that some of these regulatory hurdles can be overcome by accepting the sandbox concept. Something that they experimented with in Malaysia.
 “We were able to get into the sandbox and change legislation,” she spoke of their operations in Malaysia. Before adding; “I know Uganda is looking at it as well and that will be a real winner.”
 Founded in 2010 by Catherine Wines, Ismail Ahmed, and Richard Igoe, WorldRemit is witnessing a couple of changes.
 Also read: How Michael Wilkerson turned a side hustle into Tugende
 On October 22, 2018, they announced that Ismail was moving to the Executive Chairman position. Breon Corcoran, from Paddy Power Betfair plc, was appointed his successor as CEO. Commenting on the change, Catherine said that this is part of a succession plan.
 “As WorldRemit expands its customer base and further diversifies its product offering, Breon is joining at an exciting time for the company. Breon has led FTSE 100 with a presence in 100 countries globally. His global outlook will also enable us to realise our ambitions to find new ways to help customers do more with their money as the company scales”
 With these changes, Catherine has moved from an active executive role last year. Currently, she is doing more of an ambassadorial role.
 “I promote the business without doing the operational day to day which I did for 7 years,” she added. “I am glad I am not doing it anymore. Because for 7 years I never took a holiday. So work-life never existed for me.”
 The company has raised $220 million in total funding to date. This was through three different rounds – from Series A to Series C – led by Accel Partners, TVC and Leapfrog Ventures respectively. Yet, Catherine didn’t rule out the possibility of raising again when asked. “Maybe we will raise another round, why not?” she said.
 Currently, according to Catherine, Africa represents almost 50% of their total remittances. While the company handling $3 billion, the figure is still a drop in the ocean for a global remittance market that stands at over $500 billion according to the world bank.

 Some corrections and retractions have been made to this article regarding Catherine and Ismails age.

"Stone Atwine talks about Eversend and the intra-Africa money remittance problem
","Stone Atwine is among the few people that kick-started Uganda’s technology scene. In his entrepreneurial life, he has worked on several ventures though with a soft spot for financial technology solutions. This is shown in the nature of companies he has built before  from Useremit to, now, Eversend.
 Now based in Paris, Stone  in his own words  is “building a financial marketplace” through his latest venture, Eversend.
 In this interview  which we held over a month ago, Stone takes me inside his entrepreneurial life and what Eversend is. Enjoy.
 Malinz: You were doing Useremit right? And now you have Eversend. How are the two connected?
 Stone Atwine: We built UseRemit with the aim of transferring money from the rest of the world to Africa. Especially to Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, to deliver to mobile money. [But] after some time, we noticed something very interesting. That is that a lot of transfers coming into sub-Saharan Africa were coming from Africa.
 There was no one in the fintech space looking at this. You might have a few  one or two small companies  but not the caliber of Wave and WorldRemit bringing money into the continent for transfers within Africa.
 For example, transfers from Uganda to Kenya or Nairobi to Lagos are done by banks and brick and mortar money transfer companies like Western Union and MoneyGram.
 So we said we want to work on solving this problem. And then we realized very quickly that the platform we have for UseRemit was not built for that kind of thing for intra-Africa and also of Africa. Because now we are also looking at sending from Uganda to China or to Nigeria. So we had to build a new platform. Even the team we had for UseRemit was not going to pull that off.
 What were your figures when you decided to make a pivot?
 I cant give you a real figure right now. But I can tell you that it was about US $400,000 per month. Which is very small [compared to the competition]. But thats the challenge, the competition has raised massive amounts of money. I think Wave probably even raised money with a Power Point. [That’s why] being in Africa has its own disadvantages.
 Is that the reason you left for Paris to join Station F?
 One of the reasons, yeah.
 Has it solved the problem?
 We are not yet raising [in May], so we are going to raise as soon as I get back to Paris. So probably July we will be raising. But that is one of the reasons we moved. Because it is a lot easier to raise money in Europe. So hopefully we raise quickly then focus on the business.
 Would you recommend someone to take the same route if they find challenges raising funding from Africa?
 Yeah, but not only that. Theres a kind of revolution that is taking place almost anywhere in the world. Everyone is waking up to [the reality that] technology is going to solve our problems. So I think its wise to think ‘Where is the best place for me or what I want to do?’.
 Related: Useremit to focus on solving the intra-Africa money transfer problem
 For us, we knew we wanted to have an office in Europe. First of all to get closer to our customers. Because, with Useremit, our customers were senders who were sitting in Europe. But also to get access to better funding and talent.
 We [thus] had to choose between Amsterdam, London, and Paris. London would have been amazing. Because it is like heaven for a fintech entrepreneur. But then they have the issues of Brexit so we were not sure thats the place we wanted to go to.
 Paris is having like this kind of revolution. They are waking up and changing laws to support startups. They are putting everything they can in technology with places like Station F.
 Thats what we were looking at. Paris is a good place to be now if you are a tech entrepreneur because they are putting in a lot of effort to grow it. To grow the whole ecosystem. And the government is supportive. So, I would tell somebody to do that.
 Also read: Anthony Natif on lessons he learned from aggressive expansion, running out of money and finally raising around $3 Million
 Though some people feel like they must build their companies from home. It depends on what the person wants. But for me, I realized that the only way to build my country and my continent is to first go where I can actually build something then see how to build it.
 Worldremit raised around $40 million last year and said would focus on intra Africa. Could having a bigger player in the market be a challenge for you?
 I can tell you that they will come to do intra-Africa remittances [eventually]. Maybe it will affect us from a competition point of view. [But] competition is always there. Though doesnt faze us because we know what we are doing and our product is very very different from them.
 Our product is not really about moving money. It is just one of the things we do. So I do not see Worldremit very quickly or very soon doing things like payments of things like electricity and water payments.
 [Yet] those are some of the things that we are going to have in the app. I do not see them having an application partnering with a SACCO software which is something we could do, so you can just pay your SACCO from the Eversend wallet.
 What figure would you put on the intra-Africa market size?
 Officially, figures for the transfers coming into Africa are estimated between US $39 and 40 Billion annually. The figures for intra-Africa are around 43% of that. Which is roughly US $17 or 18 Billion. Then transfers from the continent to the rest of the world are estimated at around US $12 Billion.
 That’s a huge figure. But why hasnt someone said ‘Okay let me solve this’?
 I think the biggest challenge is mostly information. We just didnt know it was there. Maybe the people who knew were not interested. Secondly, the problem of moving money from the rest of the world to Africa is so massive that we were all blinded by it.
 Everytime you think about the US $40 billion  and possibly US $100 billion if you add informal channels of money going into Africa in just one cut  thats the problem you want to solve. So we were not looking at Intra-Africa and only thinking about the problem we must solve is the other.
 But now with companies like the Sendfree and FSD Africa, a lot of effort has been put on quantifying some of these problems. Financial inclusion is [now] a big deal. So now the numbers are starting to jump out at us.
 What is your main area of focus? Is it businesses or individuals?
 We will have individuals create accounts in the beginning. But later, we will also have business accounts that will be used for transfers and even other things. The reason for that is again on the [African] continent if you have to pay someone as a business to business transfer it is still the same thing.
 Thats why you have startups like BitPesa. They are actually focusing on B2B. I dont know their charges very well but I hear they are not very cheap. So we will also be doing B2B transfers, but not in the initial period when we launch.
 What do you think are the likely challenges you’ll face?
 The challenges are huge. Most of the existing players are not doing that [charging heavy fees] because they are bad. They [also] want to make money. In fact, all of us want to make money. But the costs are also very high for them.
 Though the advantage we have is knowledge of the market and that we have become so good at moving money. We know how to cut costs to levels that some of our competitors may not be able to do. But the challenges involved are huge. From regulation and compliance to making sure you are dealing with the right people. Fraud is a big one.
 Africa has 55 countries, are there some sweet spots for you or going after them all?
 There are some sweet spots. For example, we want to start in this market that we know very well. That’s Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ghana, and Nigeria. Mostly markets with mobile money because we are going to be dealing mostly with the mobile money system. But for us, the skys the limit. The money we will raise and how quickly we will grow will also determine where we shall go. And that is not only in Africa.

"Meet Dr. Davis Musinguzi and his Passion to digitize the Health Care Industry in Africa
","This has already been mentioned several times but I’ll go ahead and repeat it one more time; It is hard to be an entrepreneur in Africa. It is even harder to venture into the healthcare sector. It is even hardest when your target beneficiaries are the bottom of the pyramid majority who can’t afford to spend two dollars a day let alone spend it on healthcare.
 Well, that’s what Dr. Davis Musinguzi was up against when he decided to pursue his goal of revolutionizing how healthcare services are delivered. He is the Managing Director of The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG) with operations in Uganda, Kenya and Nigeria.
 TMCG is a digital health company with a portfolio of innovative ventures in medical call centers, healthcare enterprise software, and connected medical devices.
 Dr. Davis Musinguzi’s influence in the call center circles is resounding across East Africa as well as some parts of Africa. This is evidenced by his recent inclusion on the list of speakers at the Call Center Transformation Forum in Nairobi last week alongside Parshon Muranganwa from Econet Wireless and Goldermeir Opiyo from Safaricom.
 In a conversation with Dr. Davis Musinguzi, he was able to walk us through his journey of, obviously, ups and downs – just like, you guessed, every entrepreneur is.
 The Idea: 2009
 His initial vision around starting the business was some kind of frustration with the health care system. To him, health care had always lagged behind in terms of being innovative and creative.
 Secondly, it wasn’t his goal to have one of those mundane careers. For most people that pursue medicine or courses in the medical field, it is very easy to fall into that trap. A typical cycle goes like; get done with Medical School, work one or two years in a hospital then you go back for another three or four years of study to become a Specialist like a Surgeon or A Pediatrician.
 After that, you get hired by someone else or maybe start up a small Doctors practice. What eventually happens, in the end, is that the better you get the busier you get. Yet the busier you get the less of any kind of lifestyle you actually have. Dr. Davis Musinguzi wasn’t one to be drawn to this run-of-the-mill narrative. He wanted to tame the lions and fight age-old demons in Healthcare.
 Dr. Davis Musinguzi (in the middle) with a cheque The Medical Concierge Group Won at the 2014 ACIAs
 Getting to work and looking for startup funding: 2012
 It took Dr. Davis Musinguzi some time to get his idea off the ground. This was in part because he was still sniffing out for any opportunities that he’d leverage while at the same time refining it. He is a believer that when you get an idea, give it time to mature. Do some research and read as much as there is about it.
 Most people get an idea and they want to act on it immediately. Ideas also need their time to mature because normally the initial way you conceive it is not the way it should be implemented. 
 On his quest for opportunities, Dr. Davis Musinguzi finally landed on the Inspire Africa Show. This was followed by being awarded the Warid Entrepreneurship Fund which was worth $50,000.
 Also read: Meet Aisha Ali, the Founder of I Profile Foundation
 The real work begins…
 Up until he was awarded the fund, Davis’s idea was still a mere concept that he was debating around as well as polishing. He had no MVP at hand. But after the fund, he realized the actual work had to begin.
 However, to mitigate any risks of running out of cash anytime soon, he secured exactly the same amount ($50,000) from friends that he brought on board. His thinking was that as long as they had a vested interest in form of investment, they’d commit to the business.
 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
 The MVP was setting up a call center. This was staffed with doctors and pharmacists. The reasoning behind was that the general public can have access. Their revenue model at that time was advertising by placing public health infomercial before the call with the Doctor.
 However, it cost them around $100,000 – which is all the money Davis had raised. This implies that if he hadn’t thought of raising additional capital from friends, even the MVP would not have been completed.
 As a startup, keep an MVP as strictly an MVP. Inject in what is necessary not what is “cool”. Because, in the end, it is bound to change due to customer preference. As you will read on, Davis’ model shifted from B2C to B2B. Therefore, try as much as you can to keep your MVP as an MVP.
 Running out of money
 After setting up the call center and hiring a few doctors and pharmacists, the $100,000 from the Warid Entrepreneurship Fund and friends ran out in 6 months. TMCG gave up half the staff and still, the founders werent getting paid.
 Asked how he survived, his answer was “You hustle”. A phrase that’s very synonymous with all people trying to start up in Uganda. He was able to do a consultancy here and there and some savings he had stashed somewhere. He also had to ensure that the limits on his lifestyle in order to make ends meet.
 This is a common occurrence especially for startups that are being bootstrapped. If it means taking up a job or offering any short-term products and services like consultancy that can keep you going, do that. You need cash flow.
 Pivoting and landing the first client
 The advertising revenue model of placing infomercials before the calls successfully failed. It simply didn’t work. Yet, six months down the road, TMCG landed its first our first client. So how did they survive and land their first client in six months?
 They had to pivot their model to a B2B engagement, segment the health sector and identify the different players then embarked on creating a different value proposition for each.
 As a startup, stop flogging a dead horse. Try as many things as possible but only keep what works. If your initial model isn’t working, don’t be skeptical to try out a different one.
 Learning from past mistakes
 After landing the first client, their main focus was efficiency as well as a death ground strategy as Robert Greene puts it in his book the 48 Laws of Power. This was because he didn’t want to increase his overhead. He also wanted to ensure that they stretch revenue generated to keep them alive for as long as it can.
 He ensured that there was no repetition of past mistakes. As a business, their main focus was that the more revenue they generate, the less they burn. This was also achieved through automating some of the tasks.
 As a startup, you’re on a lean budget and can’t afford to make a mistake twice. Therefore, keep track of whatever mistakes you’ve made and ensure no one in the team repeats them. This is not aimed at trampling down trying new things, it’s aimed at avoiding wastage of the little or unavailable resources.
 Attending a Program by Google for Entrepreneurs
 Shifting Priority
 After landing the first client their target was now, of course, to get more. But more important than that, “when you get a customer”, according to Davis, “you study the customer. Why did they sign on with you? What are their expectations? Are our services and products meeting their requirements? How can we get other clients that are within their category of the market? How can we improve our offerings? How can we get our pricing and quality right?”
 For any startup, those questions that Davis and the team focused on are more important than “the money that you make from your first customer” as Davis put it. You need to understand your first few clients inside out. This is something that’ll help you refine your value proposition and product-market fit.
 Getting Hands Dirty
 At this point, almost a year in operation, the team is at a size of 4-5 employees. The founders were the sales people – and this, of course, including Davis. Davis says that he is yet to hire dedicated sales people. Instead, he leverages everything within his reach and network and so does his co-founders.
 This is something that most startup founders need to learn. Getting involved in actively selling or “getting your hands dirty” as many call it not only motivates you but helps you get first-hand feedback that your employees might skip in the reports they write to you.
 First Year
 His comment on how their first year went is “we survived”. But, this shouldn’t be taken lightly in a country and continent where few startups live to see their first birthday. Therefore, to Dr. Davis Musinguzi and the team, surviving the first year wasn’t just surviving, it was a victory.
 Like they say, most people dont survive their first year but even those who survive their first year, do just that survive. 
 Breakthrough
 Asked whether there’s a time Dr. Davis Musinguzi could look back and point to as TMCG’s breakthrough point, he says there is none.
 Everything is so slightly incremental. Of course, you just realize that you get better at selling it, you get better at refining your value proposition, you get better at presenting your slides, you get better at writing your concept notes, you get better at sniffing out opportunities, and you get more word of mouth across. Somebody says theyve heard about you which makes pitching a little easier. 
 And, not just Davis, a lot of successful entrepreneurs have the same answer. There’s no point in your entrepreneurship you’ll look back to and say, ‘that’s when I made it’. Instead, it’s the daily efforts that compound eventually.
 Now
 The team is now comprised of 18 phenomenal employees. These are doing everything across clinical care, software engineering, communications, finance, quality assurance, business development, research and project management. However, something interesting is that they’re now rolling out to a B2C revenue model. There are two B2C services in beta testing that are going to be publicly launched this year.

"Four Ugandan fintechs shortlisted for PayPal powered fintech Africa 2018 program
","A few days ago, Village Capital published a shortlist of companies for its PayPal powered fintech Africa 2018 program.
 The program that was announced towards the end of last year targeted Sub-Saharan Africa companies and has a total of 12 shortlisted companies from Kenya (4), Ghana (1), Nigeria (3) and Uganda (4).
 The shortlisted companies from Uganda are Patasente, Mazima Retirement Benefits, Numida and Ensibuuko.
 See also: We’ve given out over 1.7 Billion in credit to finance contracts worth more than 5.4 Billion – George Bakka, CEO Patasente
 Judging from the list, the program is looking for companies aimed at providing solutions that can enable credit scoring as well as establishing a credit history for users.
 While much progress has been made in the payments arena, access to critical services such as insurance and pensions remains lacking, part of the program overview.
 It also adds that fintech companies face regulatory barriers and infrastructure challenges that prevent their growth and expansion.
 The shortlisted companies will undergo workshops in the first two weeks of March and the top two will walk away with USD 50,000.
 One of the selected companies, Mazima Retirement Plan was among the Founders Top 10 list we released last year after garnering over 1000 subscribers who, between them, had saved over UGX. 700,000,000 ($190,000) under just two years.

"Ron Kawamara has been appointed CEO for Jumia Uganda
","Jumia has announced Ron Kawamara, who has been with the company for over 5 years, as the CEO for Uganda. This was at a press briefing held today in Kampala. The company also announced their plans for the upcoming Jumia Black Friday.
 Since joining Jumia, Ron has served in different roles. First as Country Manager for Jumia Food Uganda to head of Jumia Food East Africa.
 Ron has previously served as the Regional Managing Director of Jumia Food, East Africa, and brings his wealth of experience in the African eCommerce industry, wrote Jumia in a press release.
 He also served as the Managing Director for Jumia Uganda. Though the position had limitations. My role at that time was not focusing on individual performance, it was more about compliance and investor relations, he told me.
 But, the new role gives him more power and control over Jumias activities in Uganda. The CEO position is more elevated which means that it can make things happen quicker, Ron pointed out. Adding that he now owns everything from the P&amp;Ls, the failures, the successes and so on.
 Massimiliano Spalazzi, a Jumia Co-CEO for e-Commerce as well as Sefik Bagdadioglu, the CMO for Jumia E-commerce were also present.
 Both Spalazzi and Ron told me that the creation of the CEO role is an attempt to re-organize the company as well as create leadership that is solid. It is making sure that we have the leadership on the ground that is empowered to be able to make CEO level decisions on the ground, Ron said.
 This change is likely to affect internal processes and reporting more than how the company is perceived on the outside.
 Also read: Kilimall has completely shut down its Ugandan business
 Before, while I still worked at the company and until recently, the reporting was carried out independently by each venture. For example, Jumia Food and Jumia Travel would report separately to the central team in Paris or Dubai. With the new arrangement, both ventures would be required to report to Ron who in turn reports to either the regional CEO (if they decide to appoint one) or directly to the Group CEO.
 Ron told me that the position of Regional Managing Director for Jumia Food East Africa that he has vacated will be filled. Yes, we already have people in place for the Jumia food side, he said. Though it is likely to be filled by Shreenal Ruparelia, who is the Managing Director for Jumia Food Kenya.
 Both Massimiliano and Ron declined to comment on whether the new organization structure in Uganda will be adopted across other 20+ countries on the continent.
 They also didnt go in detail when asked whether this new structure will influence the annual reporting. For example, companies like the MTN Group report for each country separately as well as the group. We see ourselves as one company across Africa, Ron said. Adding that they are one P&amp;L to our investors, so we try to report as a group.
 Earlier this year, Ham Namakajjo left as Country Director for Jumia E-commerce to head back to Fezah, an artist booking startup, he co-founded. This meant that his position was left vacant and no replacement has been appointed to date.
 According to Ron, that might not come any time soon. I think the best way to say this is that Jumia E-commerce has a senior team, so at the moment, I dont anticipate that that will change, Ron said.
 Sefik has been giving support to the Ugandan Jumia E-commerce team support ever since Ham left. According to Ron, with his appointment as CEO, that is likely to change. But, he will will stay on to support the marketing team while Ron will continue to tap into his expertise. Now we have the CEO for Uganda, he will no longer be supporting [us] but more of giving marketing support, Ron said.
 Update:
 We had initially misspelled Spalazzis name. Jumia also pointed out that Jumia Mall is called Jumia E-commerce and Sefiks role is CMO for Jumia E-commerce. We have since corrected them.

"Jibu is now in the Democratic Republic of Congo
","Jibu, a franchising social enterprise, is expanding to the Democratic Republic of Congo. “We will open Jibu drinking water franchises in Bukavu and Goma in the DRC in August 2018,” Audrey Royston, the M&amp;E at Jibu, wrote in an email.
 This expansion follows the companys closure of a $7 Million Series B financing round at the end of 2017. The figure brings the total amount of funding raised to $10 Million
 Jibu wants to reach 1,000 drinking water franchises in a dozen more countries in four years time.
 “The DRC expansion moves Jibu closer to realize our goal to launch 1,000 drinking water franchises in at least a dozen new countries by 2022,” wrote Audrey. “Expanding our franchising model serves new markets that are hungry for entrepreneurial opportunities and clean, affordable water.”
 Read About: The Medical Concierge Group has raised $200,000 as it marks its 5th birthday
 Founded in 2012 by Randy and Galen Welsch, Jibu provides local entrepreneurs with equipment to filtrate and bottle clean water, as they sell and market it.
 The company was also part of Cohort 1 of Spring, a startup accelerator empowering girls and young women.
 Jibu has raised capital through various avenues including debt and grants. This goes towards providing the franchisees with equipment, financing, in-store supplies, marketing, branding, and training to start the franchise.
 Each entrepreneur pays a start-up fee and Franchise Network Fee as long as they reach profitability through water sold.
 As demand for Jibu products increases, so do franchising opportunities for aspiring entrepreneurs across the Jibu network, including those in Uganda,” notes Audrey.
 Jibu’s expansion is exemplary to emerging startups that seek to cross the borders at one point in their operation. Audrey states that it increases “customer awareness and customer adoption of Jibu.
 To date, Jibu’s social franchising system has 52 entrepreneurs bought in. These pay an up-front, one-time licensing fee of between $1,000 to $2,000 to get some “skin in the game” before Jibu begins investing.
 After a grace period, franchisees pay a flat fee per liter  the Franchise Network Fee  to Jibu based on the liters of water that flow through the water filtration unit, Audrey pointed out.

 In a 2015 conversation with the Guardian, Mr. Randy Welsch projected the company to become profitable by the end of 2018. He also expressed a willingness to maximize social returns.
 “Once we feel confident that we’ve got a truly replicable business model, we want to share everything we can and enable others to copy us,” he said.
 DRC will be the companys sixth operation ground, with existence in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe already registered.
 Randy said that Jibu targets high to low and middle-income consumers (the middle 70%) in urban and peri-urban areas who typically boil their water to make it safer to drink.

"Does MTN Organize Innovation Awards and Competitions to Steal Ideas?
","Towards the end of September 2017, the Innovation Village organized a Soiree – which is an internal networking event for the inhabitants. The event happened at a time when MTN was calling for applications to its 2017 Innovation Awards slated to take place in November.
 At the same event, John Babirukamu, the MTN Uganda Digital Communications Manager, gave a brief explanation about the awards, encouraged the various innovators to apply and later took questions from the audience.
 Though, one of the issues that stood out was the fact innovators accused MTN of stealing startups ideas. John made an attempt to clear the issue but the attendants didnt seem convinced.
 It should be noted that there have been cases of bigger players preying on the smaller ones for some time now  for example, Google and Yelp.
 For the case of Uganda, MTN has been criticised on several occasions for stealing ideas. In this medium post, Mwesigwa Daniel – a tech blogger in Kampala – wonders if MTN Uganda went back to its sinful ways of preying on Startups.
 However, in a separate email conversation with John Babirukamu, he dismissed the allegations. Saying;
 “As MTN, it is our policy not to take or steal ideas either generated at our App challenges or Hackathons or exhibited at our Innovation awards. We instead partner where possible with winners &amp; innovative individuals through the use of our API’s &amp; services to better enhance their apps.
 He pointed out that MTN has come up with several innovative ideas in the past that people have gone on to claim the telecom giant stole simply because theyre similar to theirs.
 “In the past, several individuals searching for common problems like financial inclusion and mobile banking thought up some very innovative solutions that were similar in some ways to what MTN had already been developing. It is this coincidence that leads them to think we still [sic] Ideas. However, these projects are executed with partners who have several years’ experience doing the same in other countries,” John said.
 When asked, since – as he pointed out – MTN isn’t stealing any ideas, what can be done to clear the situation, John recommended that whoever is to participate in their awards or competitions should read the terms and conditions for participation carefully.
 
 We have clear terms and conditions on our website to show the rules of engagement in all our competitions. This is also backed up by participants in previous competitions who can testify to the true purpose of our awards  John Babirukamu.
 
 In a separate conversation with innovators and startup founders around Kampala – especially in tech, many claimed the company reaps off innovators. However, they were afraid of being quoted fearing  that  since the telecom rules the tech innovation space in Uganda  they may be blacklisted.
 James Wire – another popular tech blogger with vast knowledge on ICT, Innovation, and telecoms said that it is hard to tell whether the company steals ideas or not.  He, however, cited a couple of scenarios that Mwesigwa Daniel also pointed out in his medium post.
 
 Its hard to say that they steal or dont steal the ideas but I know of a case where MTN slugged it out with a local company whose product they had stolen. Remember Me2U?  James Wire on whether MTN steals startup ideas or not.
 
 It should also be noted that in 2009, in South Africa, a Polokwane couple sued MTN for allegedly stealing their concept when it ran the controversial MTN15 competition that same year.
 To add a similar case concerning the theft of ideas in Kampala, James Wire pointed out one involving KCCA and a University student where the City Authority turned down the students proposal only to go ahead and implement a similar product.
 “There was another case of some University kids that proposed a QR code system to manage taxis in Kampala. KCCA turned down the opportunity only to launch a similar service a few months down the road,” James said.
 He also acknowledged that the vice could be deeper as “most business development personnel in those big companies hijack ideas from unsuspecting innovators.” Which clarifies the point where James said he is not sure whether MTN steals the ideas or not. Because, if it is the employees whore stealing the ideas, then it is their liability  not MTN.
 When asked if there’s a way for innovators to protect themselves against the vice, James recommends that Innovators should start to actively participate in Intellectual Property studies.
 
 First, our innovators as a rule of thumb need to undertake some studies in IPR. I did that years back and it has helped me in many spheres  James Wire on the importance of IP studies.
 
 He advises that this can be approached in a simple way by innovation hubs organizing IPR workshops and get people like him to train the Innovators at a modest fee. “Chances are high that the basic IPR knowledge will go a long way in helping them,” James added.
 After these workshops, James suggests that larger organizations that demand lots of money can then be engaged. This is where, according to James, lobbying from the government should be considered. Though, he advises that this should be approached on a united front by use of associations like ICTA-U.
 Secondly, he suggests that there should be a simpler process one can go through to legally engage companies engaged in the vice of stealing ideas and innovations. As the system is currently, James says that one requires a vault with hundreds of millions to take on an MTN.

"This is how Africa&#8217;s 10 biggest VC funding rounds of 2019 (so far) compare to 2018
","Going by the first half of 2019, African startups are raising VC funding at an unprecedented rate. Unlike in the past where large venture capital funding rounds into the continent depended on a few companies  take an example of Jumia and Takealot  this year, not only are the sizes of the funding rounds going up but so is the number of startups that are raking in that funding.
 In the first half (H1) of 2019 (so far), the top 10 VC rounds raised by African startups were for a total of US $242.5 million compared to US $165.7 million in the first half of 2018 H1, a growth of 46.3%.
 Using Digest Africa data about investment into African startups, we have identified the startups that are leading the VC funding board so far this year. We compared them to a similar list for funding in 2018. In this particular list, we only included startups that are either headquartered in Africa, have Africa as their only/primary market or are incorporated in Africa. That is why we excluded companies like Branch International that many might include in their research for African startups.
 Looking at the list, Andela raised the highest round so far while Nigerian ride-hailing startup Gokada, which recently raised a $5.3 million Series A, rounds off the list. Amongst countries, Nigeria has the highest representation on the list with three (3) startups and the financial services sector’s dominance seems to be waning.
 1. Andela’s $100M Series D vs Zola Electric’s $55M Series D: Since the beginning of 2019, Andela has raised the highest amount of funding across Africa. In January the startup announced that it had raised a $100 million Series D round that was led by Generation Investment Management with participation from existing investors including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GV, Spark Capital, and CRE Venture Capital. The most recent financing brought Andelas total venture funding to $180M, making it the most capitalised venture-backed private company across Africa given that Jumia recently went public while Takealot was wholly acquired by Naspers in 2018. By the same time last year, Zola Electric had registered the highest VC funding round with $55 million in a series D round of investment that was led by Helios Investment Partners. One can not fail to notice the huge difference between the two funding figures, which is an indicator of the strong start in 2019 compared to 2018.
 2. CarePay’s $45M Series A vs Cellulant’s $47.5M Series C: Kenyan mobile healthcare payments startup CarePay announced on May 14, 2019, that it had raised investment for what seemed an unusual amount for a Series A, $45 million. Per Digest Africa data, only Africa Logistics Partners and Jumia have recorded a higher or equal Series A round size. CarePay pointed out that they are looking to use their investment to expand beyond Kenya into Nigeria and Tanzania. On the other hand, its matchup from 2018 is Cellulant’s $47.5 million Series C which the Kenyan company raised in May 2018.
 3. PEG Africa $25M Series C vs M-Kopa $10M: Despite the closure of Mobisol, renewable energy startups are still attracting capital. In April 2019, Ghanaian startup PEG Africa announced that it had raised a $25 million Series C from CDC Group which was joined by some of its existing lenders -.SunFunder and ResponsAbility. However, PEG Africa’s Series C was an unusual one carrying a combination of debt and equity. The debt came from CDC Group while the equity investment came from existing investors, Energy Access Ventures, Blue Haven Initiative, I&amp;P Afrique Entrepreneurs (a fund managed by Investisseurs &amp; Partenaires) and Acumen, as well as from new investors, Total Energy Ventures and the Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP). PEG Africa’s matchup from last year is Kenya’s solar startup  M-Kopa  which raised at least $10 million in a venture round that they announced last year.
 4. Payitup $13M Series A vs Africa’s Talking $8.6M Series A: Zimbabwe hasn’t recorded any significant venture funding rounds before. That is why Payitup’s $13 million Series A was quite surprising. The Harare-based payments startup secured the investment from London’s Thawer Fund Management at a $20-million valuation according to CEO Aretha Gonyora. TechZim estimates that “working backwards this gives an estimate shareholding of 35% remaining with the founders and 65% being taken up by the investor”. On the other hand, Africa’s Talking’s $8.6 million Series A came in fourth place for the year 2018.
 5. RapidDeploy $12M Series A vs Swvl $8M Series A: Founded in 2014, RapidDeploy is a South African startup  which later relocated to Austin, Texas  that offers clouded aided dispatch services. The round was led by GreatPoint Ventures and Samsung NEXT. In conjunction with the funding, Ray Lane, Managing Partner at GreatPoint Ventures and former President and COO of Oracle, will join RapidDeploy’s Board of Directors. The company intends to use the funds to accelerate the development and deployment of its Cloud Aided DispatchTM platform. On the other hand, Swvl’s $8 million Series A came in at number 5 on the 2018 list.
 6. mPharma $12M Series A vs Jibu $7M: A healthtech startup, mPharma is among the now most revered across the continent. In March this year, Quartz Africa reported that the six-year-old Ghanaian startup that manages prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers is buying Kenya’s second-largest pharmacy chain, Haltons, in a fantastic deal for the African startup ecosystem. This year, it announced that it had closed a $12 million Series B led by 4DX Ventures, an Accra/San Francisco venture capital firm, and Nairobi-based Novastar Ventures. Aside from the Series B, mPharma also raised $1.5 million in grant funding from the Skoll Foundation in April this year. While Rwanda’s social enterprise, Jibu ranked 6th with its $7 million Series B in 2018.
 7. Daystar Power Africa $10M Series A vs Lidya $6.9M Series B: The solar energy company announced that it raised a $10 million Series A from Persistent Energy Capital LLC as well as Verod Capital Management in March 2019. This particular round also represented Verod Capital’s final investment from its $115 million Growth Capital Fund II launched in 2014. Founded in 2017, Daystar Power Africa, a solar energy company, specialises in providing individuals as well as enterprises with efficient solar energy solutions. Operating in Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania, DayStar Africa provides energy to institutions for banking, consumer goods, agriculture and manufacturing needs. The company is owned by Sunray Ventures which was founded by Christian Wessels and Jasper Graf von Hardenberg. In 2018, Nigerian fintech Lidya raised a $6.9 million Series B from Omidyar Network and a couple of other investors.
 8. InstaDeep $7M Series A vs Lori Systems $6.17M: London headquartered InstaDeep, an Enterprise AI startup, announced it has raised $7 million in Series A funding. The leading pan-African private equity firm, AfricInvest, led the investment, with participation from Endeavor Catalyst, a New York-based co-investment fund under Endeavor. On the other hand, Lori Systems, a Nairobi based logistics startup with major operations across Nigeria, raised a $6.17 million Series A round that it never announced.
 9. TeamApt $5.5M Series A vs Wuzzuf $6M Series B: Nigerian fintech startup TeamApt raised $5.5 million in capital in a Series A round led by Quantum Capital Partners. The Lagos based firm will use the funds to expand its white label digital finance products and pivot to consumer finance with the launch of its AptPay banking app. TeamApt, whose name is derivative of aptitude, bootstrapped its way to its Series A by generating revenue project to project working for Nigerian companies, according to CEO Eniolorunda who spoke to TechCrunch. Recruitment startup, Wuzzuf, on the other hand, raised a $6 million Series B in 2018.
 10. Gokada $5.3M Series A vs. WeFarm/Terragon Group $5M Series A: Embattled with the exodus of most of its senior employees towards the end of last year as well as the beginning of this, Gokada recently announced that it raised a $5.3 million Series A. This particular round of funding for Gokada came on the back of Uganda’s SafeBoda securing an undisclosed Series B from Allianz X who was making their first investment into Africa. The funding rounds signify the coming of age of the transportation and logistics sector across Africa. The round was led by Rise Capital. Its equivalent in 2018 was Wefarm and Terragon Group which both raised $5 million in Series A rounds.

"Ethiopia switched off the internet last week, Benin repeals social media tax
","Last week, Ethiopia switched off the internet in the Addis Ababa areas. That is according to Chinese News Agency, Xinhua, and Berhan Taye  who leads Access Nows #KeepItOn campaign against internet shutdowns.
 Berhan told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on September 18 that she was able to verify that access to the internet had been cut by analyzing traffic data and speaking with about 20 people across the city.
 CPJ then issued a statement on Friday last week against the act. Mobile internet was unavailable in the capital Addis Abba, from September 17 to the morning of September 19, wrote CPJ.
 Also read: A total of $160M was raised last week, and more
 This, however, only affected mobile users. Berhan told CPJ that residents who use fixed lines to access the internet could still go online. However, many Ethiopians rely on mobile technology to access the internet.
 Ethiopian authorities did not respond to CPJs questions about whether they ordered access to be cut. When CPJ called Ethio Telecoms internet-listed phone numbers, an individual who answered said that there had been a problem with the internet on those dates, wrote CPJ.
 
 When CPJ asked to be transferred to an official spokesperson who could elaborate, the individual said that they did not know the appropriate person to respond. CPJs September 20th email to Ethio Telecom spokesperson Abdurahim Ahmed was not answered. Abdurahim could also not be reached on his mobile phone and a text message to the same line went unanswered.
 
 The shutdown came the same day as protests in Addis Ababa over clashes in which ethnic minorities were targeted, according to these same media reports and Atnafu Berhane, an Addis-based journalist who spoke with CPJ.
 CPJ condemned the act, urging the authorities to ensure the internet is available at all times to enable journalists to do their job.
 The Committee to Protect Journalists urged Ethiopian authorities to ensure internet is available, including during times of unrest when access to information provided by journalists is crucial.

 In other news, the Benin government announced that they were repealing the social media tax they adopted on July 25, 2018. They tweeted the announcement on September 22, with a promise to issue a formal press release, later.
 On July 01, 2018, Uganda became the first African country to tax Over The Top Services (OTT). The country charges $0.052 a day for access to services like Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook and more.

"CDC commits $15M towards CCA&#8217;s $100M Nigeria-focused SME fund
","CDC, the UK’s development finance institution, has today announced a new investment designed to support high-growth SMEs in Nigeria. CDC has made a US$15 million commitment to CardinalStone Capital Advisors Growth Fund (“CCA”).
 CCA is a first-time, Nigeria-focused fund that targets SMEs across six sectors: agriculture, industrials, FMCG, healthcare, education and financial services. CCA will use CDC’s capital to invest in companies which support job creation, as well as import substitution to diversify the Nigerian economy.
 CDC has worked closely with the CardinalStone Capital Advisors team for two and a half years and played a key role in the formation of the fund. CDC is an anchor investor alongside Kuramo, a leading African investment firm, and has helped mobilise additional investment of US$15 million from the Dutch development bank FMO and NSIA (the Nigerian sovereign wealth fund).
 The fund has reached US$50 million of commitments at first close. However, CCA plans to raise up to US$100mn in total commitments by the final close of the Fund.
 Clarisa de Franco, CDC’s Managing Director said:
 “As a pioneering investor in African private equity we are delighted to be supporting CardinalStone’s first fund that will bring investment and expertise to the local entrepreneurs and high growth SMEs that are vital to Nigeria’s long-term economic growth and job creation. We have worked with CardinalStone from the beginning, helping them build a team and raise other investment. 
 “CDC has invested in Nigeria for 70 years. The country plays a key part in CDC’s strategy of partnership and investment for economic growth in West Africa.”
 CDC recently announced its ambition to invest up to US$4.5bn across Africa over the next four years. In November 2018 a CDC delegation led by Chief Executive Nick O’Donohoe and Chairman Graham Wrigley met Nigerian investors, regulators and politicians to discuss CDC’s continued ambition to partner with Nigeria, and to explore ways to encourage more domestic and foreign investment in the country.
 CDC has played a pioneering role in supporting the private equity industry in Nigeria which channels growth capital to companies. Twenty years ago, CDC backed Nigeria’s first private equity fund, the Capital Alliance Private Equity Fund I from African Capital Alliance and has invested in all five of its subsequent funds. African Capital Alliance remains a market-leading investor in Nigeria. In November 2018, CDC also announced a US$25 million investment in Nigerian-led, Synergy Private Equity Fund II which invests in high-growth SME businesses in Nigeria and its West African neighbours.

"Here is the 8 YC alumni from Africa with at least $1M in follow-on funding
","In 2015, YC started admitting startups in Africa into their batches  both winter and summer. This number has grown in with time. According to our count, there are at least 14 startups from Africa that have graduated to date.

"Has MTN pulled the plug on the MTN App challenge?
","MTN has played a crucial role when it comes to contributing to Ugandas technology innovation space. This has been through various initiatives including awards, partnerships with hubs and competitions. One of these initiatives is the MTN App challenge that the telecom company started in 2015.
 Yet  I have reasons to believe the company might be pulling the plug on the challenge.
 When I contacted the team at MTN Uganda in charge of the App challenge, they werent clear in their answering.
 Valery Okecho, the Corporate Communications Manager at MTN Uganda, dodged making a clarification on the App Challenge. Instead, he commented on the MTN Innovation Awards which he said will take place.
 The [MTN] Innovation Awards is an annual event, so yeah theyll take place this year, Valery said. But, he later referred me to Susan Kayemba  the Project Lead of the App challenge and The Innovation Awards.
 When I contacted Susan, she informed me that they havent yet confirmed the dates. But she didnt clarify what the dates were for exactly. Given that I asked her about both the Innovation Awards and the App Challenge.
 Unfortunately, we [havent] yet confirmed [the] dates. When set, we shall communicate to [the] public as we always do, Susan wrote to me over WhatsApp. Efforts to get her to clarify what the dates were for exactly were futile.
 Also read: Apps Africa opens applications for its Innovation Awards
 Yet, all indicators show that the MTN App challenge  that has only happened twice in the past three years  is unlikely to take place again this year.
 Because, in all the previous two editions, the challenge has always happened in the second quarter. We are now getting mid-way the third quarter. A similar challenge in Ghana, by MTN Ghana, has already taken place.
 When I spoke to some of the people who have partnered with MTN on several projects, they told me that the challenge is unlikely to take place this year. One of them told me that the company has been very busy this year chasing its license renewal.
 Another informed me that the company is rethinking their whole approach to contributing to the innovation space in Uganda.
 Basically, the two reasons can be broken down with the explanations below. I added them after thinking about the whole thing logically. The third one is a wild thought.
 One is that theres been so much work for telecoms to do so far this year in form of compliance. And, for MTN  in particular  is looking to have their license renewed. Something that calls for them to be extra complaint and cautious.
 Secondly, I was told that the company might reconsider its approach towards supporting innovators and the innovation ecosystem in Uganda. Which could also be true.
 For example, MTN  through the MTN Foundation  partnered with The Innovation Village to launch tukole.ug. A platform for freelancers and casual laborers to find gigs. Thus, it is easier to conclude that MTN could be considering relegating their involvement to the MTN Foundation.
 The third option could be that the company is considering having the app challenge once every two years. This is because they first organized it in 2015, then skipped 2016 and held it again in 2017. Which to me is very unlikely and doesnt make sense.

"6 Ways to Nail Part-time Entrepreneurship in Africa
","More often than not, startups in Africa are started by people who have no savings stashed away or a hand from family members let alone friends. Instead, these entrepreneurs have to juggle between gigs and jobs to ensure they support their new ventures.
 Not forgetting that the lack of up-to-standard incubators across the continent dictates that most young startup founders need that exposure to a real work environment to acquire a certain set of skills like managing a team, finances, and others.
 This leaves them no option but to juggle two or more things at ago. Though some are able to pull it off, most struggle and often end up abandoning their startup. Those that hold on tend to deliver below their true potential on both their 8-5 as well as their startups.
 Here are 6 tips on how to ensure you dont quit your job or gig world but still not putting your startup at risk.
 
 
 Time Management
 
 
 As long as you enter the world of part-time entrepreneurship, time should become your new currency  guard it jealously. Make sure you only attend meetings that are a must attend, pick calls that are a must pick, engage in conversations that are a must.
 You now have to keep a close tab on how you spend each and every single minute of the day to eliminate any wastages. Start taking note of how long each task takes you to accomplish. If it is a repetitive task, make sure you try as much as possible to cut down that time.
 All in all, you have to make sure that your time is only spent on stuff and people that are helping you build your startup or improve efficiency at your day-time job. Do note that this does not mean doing away with alone and family time.
 2. Similar Industry
 This goes to those contemplating starting part-time entrepreneurship. If possible, make sure your startup and current field of employment are in the same or similar industry.
 This will save you a lot of time and energy. For example, if your startup is in recruitment services and your current job is in recruitment services, it means that you can leverage the same connections youre building for your current employer. Not forgetting the skills. Itll also save you the opportunity cost in terms of energy of switching your mind.
 Itll also save you the opportunity cost in terms of energy of switching your mind from one thing to another. Just imagine working in a services industry and at the end of the day, your startup is in the manufacturing of products.
 So, the recommendation is that you try as much as possible to startup in an industry similar to your current employers

 3. Delegation
 This, of course, has now become a cliche. But, its re-appearance on the list is the emphasis on how important it is. As an individual, you only have 24 hours in a day of which you lose 6-8 to sleep. When you factor in an additional 8-10 hours you dedicate to your employers, it means that youre left with roughly 6-8 hours per day to work on your startup.
 As an individual, you only have 24 hours a day. Of which you lose 6-8 to sleep. When you factor in an additional 8-10 hours you dedicate to your employers, it means that youre left with roughly 6-8 hours per day to work on your startup.
 Just imagine you brought on board someone else to give a hand with an additional 6-8 hours per day? That means you can accomplish almost twice as much as you can  assuming theyre at almost the same level of productivity as you.
 Secondly, as you start taking your startup off the ground, a number of work increases. Youll have more meetings to attend, more paperwork, more (networking) events to attend and the list goes on.
 But, not all of these will be equally important. Others just need you to show face or have a representative from your startup. So, make sure you have a right-hand man/woman that you can always call up to shadow you.
 4. Collaboration tools
 This is applicable to every startup  no matter which industry youre in. By the fact that youre still working for another company, it means you dont have offices yet. Which implies that, if you have a team, everyone is scattered.
 So, how do you bring everyone closer and ensure you keep tabs on each and every team member? Make use of collaboration tools. Take an example of creating a WhatsApp group or use of Skype groups as well as Google suite.
 Also read: Top 6 Collaboration Tools for Ugandan Startups on a Lean Budget
 These tools will ensure each team member gives in as though theyre working from an office close to you. However, having these tools in place doesnt mean your team members will just ship automatically. You must ensure you put in an extra effort to follow-up with your team on a daily.
 5. Automation
 This applies to startups that have certain tasks that are repetitive. Take an example of running social media accounts. This is something that can be automated by use of tools like HootSuite or Buffer.
 Make sure you identify those repetitive tasks and look out for tools or ways to ensure you stop doing them manually and instead have them automated. Youre likely to find some free tools online or some on a freemium model.
 6. Procrastination
 If youre looking at jumping into part-time entrepreneurship and really balance both your job and startup, you have to say bye to procrastination. Make sure youre ready to eat the frog whenever it presents itself.
 Sure, there are some boring and impossible things thatll come your way more often than not. However, quit pushing these to a later day or time and instead tackle them there and then.
 Otherwise, be ready to have a growing to-do list each and every day of which majority will be tasks that should have been done a long time ago. In the end, this cripples your morale.
 To avoid procrastination, you need to become more organized than ever before. Because any slight task overflow leads to not accomplishing another. Also, make sure you rank priority tasks higher on the list.
 Ideally, every person starting out desires to have the entire 24 hours to focus on their startup but that is not possible.
 But, in Africa, having a steady paycheck or salary coming to ones pockets is the surest way to predict the lifespan of their startup. Other than that, the majority of startup founders have ideas that always remain on paper.
 Making use of the above tips wont give you the same productivity that youd have had if you were working on your startup 24 hours a day but will ensure you balance 8-5 more efficiently.

"What happened to Yoza? [Part 2 of 3]
","I have received a lot of feedback for part one of the series of what happened to Yoza App. I want to appreciate everyone that took the time to read it and send feedback both online and offline.
 
 
 Tell me your dreams and I will make them come true — Mozey Radio (Streetlights)
 
 
 To us, the product-market fit was seeing the subscription numbers grow. We had a few customers who loved our product and were our somewhat loyal customers for the next few months. So, with the money already in the bank, all we had to do is make sure they had a specific washer, at a specific time in the week.
 Naiga (background) with her daughter washing for a client.
 Laundry was done on weekends and washers were paid on Wednesdays. Wednesday nights were reserved for a beer and brainstorm session which also gave us the chance to call each other out.
 Thursday nights were for Jamrock (reggae night). And we would go to Iguana (Bar). Hand out fliers as well as buy the Deejays some beer or Red bull for a couple of mentions about our product. This was our repeatable execution model, then hit the weekend again
  Find purpose
 The most rewarding part of building this business was stumbling upon the fact that our service was helping single mothers like Naiga pay their rent and take care of their babies.
 After washer training. (Forgive image quality)
 I remember some hard days when everything wasn’t working. But we kept on going for the women who depended on the app to find more customers. Most washers went from doing laundry for 2 customers a week to 10 -15 customers.
 Media Traction
 We got media coverage from CNN and BBC at the end of the 2015 and start of 2016. This amazing PR generated a lot business for us. This was such a big deal for our startup and opened us up to crazy opportunities.
 Source: CNN
 We got an all-time high before Christmas. Customers kept pouring in and we dug into the work. The manual process helped visit our clients. We discovered how most clients would show small acts of kindness to our washers. For example, giving them breakfast before they started washing.
 We used the wave to partner with Dry cleaning companies for our premium clients. And another big partnership with IFF.
 Powder Detergent
 When you think about laundry, I bet you will think about that laundry bin in the corner of your bedroom you keep adding to but never want to do. We saw the whole customer journey. Though one opportunity we came to appreciate was the powder detergent. It was at the centre of all the laundry, hence our partnership with IFF
 “My bed sheets smell really nice and I love your powder detergent.” — Customer feedback.
 IFF makes fragrance technology that companies like Unilever use in powder detergent. I must say they are the best at what they do at least from testing different fragrances with our customers.
 We were doing market research. Doing it as a service for a global brand and competing with very well established firms.
 Our technology made customer research feedback instant. Compared to waiting for months to get this feedback.
 We created so much value for the laundry and tech industry with so much ease. I guess that’s what product market fit feels like.
 First signs of danger
 Much as we genuinely won the hearts of our customer. We overlooked one big thing that was developing and growing right under our noses.
 We underestimated the technology divide between our customers and washers. The washers had features phones and our customers had smartphones.
 Yes, we appreciated talking to our customer physically. BUT this was turning out to be one painful business to run if we didn’t fix it. True, this played a part in our failure but this was not the only reason that we found ourselves in this mess we are in.

 Founded in 2009 by Tayo Oviosu (CEO) and Jay Alabraba (Director Business Development), Paga says that it has over 9 million customers and 17,000 agents across Nigeria.
 This recent round brings Pagas total amount of funding raised to date to at least $35 million.
 In October 2015, the company closed a $13 million Series B in a round led by Adlevo Capital, with participation from Goodwell Investments, Omidyar Network and Capricon Investment group.
 This round signifies the importance of payments to the African continent. Given that in the past few weeks, three payments startups have raked in a combined total of $34 million. Paystack raised $8 million a week ago while South Africas Yoco announced today that it had raised $16 million from Partech.
 Additionally, when you look at the list of startups that have raked in the highest amount in terms of deal size, they are still dominating.

"InstaDeep raises $7M Series A led by AfricInvest
","London headquartered InstaDeep, an Enterprise AI startup, announced on May 3rd, 2019 that it had raised $7 million in Series A funding. The leading pan-African private equity firm, AfricInvest, led the investment, with participation from Endeavor Catalyst, a New York-based co-investment fund under Endeavor.
 The funding supports the development of a scalable product platform aimed at empowering enterprises with better decision-making using Artificial Intelligence. The product-driven platform, leveraging deep reinforcement learning and other advanced machine learning technologies, brings AI to applications within an enterprise environment, allowing companies to optimise decisions and improve efficiency.
 “Through our own cutting-edge research, we have developed a platform that goes beyond what we have seen in AI applications in the past. It can tackle challenging optimisation and automation challenges in dynamic and complex environments such as, but not limited to, mobility, logistics, manufacturing and energy. We already see that our product is providing real value and ROI for our clients”, says Co-Founder and CEO of InstaDeep, Karim Beguir.
 The new platform marks a milestone for InstaDeep, who has seen sustained growth and achievements since its humble beginnings in Tunisia as a bootstrap in 2014 including being one of the first ever African-founded AI companies to publish original AI research at NeurIPS 2018⁽¹⁾. Through its strategic partnership with AfricInvest, InstaDeep also aims to continue bringing advanced AI opportunities to Africa.
 “We want to grow an African AI success story and are on a mission to democratise Machine Learning in Africa. By partnering with AfricInvest, we can leverage their operational expertise and strong business knowledge on the continent, and together accelerate talent and positive use of AI”, says Beguir.
 Through its investments, AfricInvest expects to meaningfully contribute to this development. “InstaDeep has managed to establish an excellent reputation for delivering solid and unique AI solutions, and we are excited to see what they can deliver next with the support from AfricInvest. We believe the company has a bright future ahead and could lead the development of the AI sector throughout the continent and beyond” says Khaled Ben Jilani, Senior Partner at AfricInvest.
 “AfricInvest will draw on its African business expertise to support InstaDeep’s research and development, and also their talent development program. Together, our combined knowledge will help the African continent rise to the opportunities offered by AI.”
 Endeavor has also confirmed they are joining the investment round, news that comes hot on the heels of Beguir being selected by the global high-impact entrepreneurship movement as an Endeavor Entrepreneur for Tunisia. Specifically, it’s Endeavor’s fund Endeavor Catalyst that is injecting capital, an organisation known for rigorously selecting only elite start-ups. The company will also assist in connecting US CEOs and further investors with InstaDeep.

"Women In Technology Uganda Giving Hope to School Drop Outs
","Women in Technology Uganda (WITU) aims at Empowering, Inspiring and Training the next generation of Uganda female leaders, business women, and technologists. WITU has the vision to reduce the technological gap that exists between girls and boys.
 In a bid to understand how WITU operates, we had a conversation with Irene Kituyi, Director of Operations at WITU.
 According to Irene, one of the reasons WITU was founded is that if you call a tech meeting, youll find more males than females.
 
 Yet, when we enter school doing sciences, we are at the same level. Why does it happen that when it comes to taking professions, girls dont take tech as a profession?  Irene
 
 Currently, they work with girls at different levels of the education ladder. From primary schools, Ordinary and Advanced level as well as those at tertiary level.
 Though, of all these, our interest lay with the program aimed at girls who drop out of schools. WITU organizes a special program for this group to interest them in technology. But, prior to being admitted to the cohort, theyre given a three months training which includes basic computer training, life skills, and entrepreneurship.
 Initially, the main focus of the cohort program was to train these girls on how to start tech businesses. But, they later learned that some couldnt afford or had different interests.
 Thats when they decided to make the program broader to accommodate even those that werent looking to start tech businesses as well as girls that looking to be employed.
 Another important aspect of the cohort program that the team at WITU never saw coming was the inclusion of Sexual Reproductive Health among the topics covered as well as life skills.
 This was after learning that some of the girls were skipping training due to sexual reproductive related issues.
 Plus, like any human being, Irene says that they needed to know themselves better in order to build self-esteem as well as communicate effectively. Therefore, their training aims at interlinking all that.
 To them, the above is not only necessary for those looking to start their own businesses but even those looking to be employed.
 Currently, WITU is training cohort number 13 since the inception of the program in 2015 and each of these cohorts averages 75 girls. The girls are required to trek daily to the WITU premises located on Kanjokya street in Kamwokya.
 Which explains why the majority of the participants are from surrounding areas of Kawempe, Kamwokya, Kyebando, Bukoto, Kisaasi. Though there are some that come from as far as Mbuya and Najjera.
 Girls attending a session at WITU premises
 They hold two sessions to ensure everyone is covered. The first session is in the morning and starts at 9 am to midday and the second one in the afternoon from three to six pm.
 Asked if they are for profit or not, Irene highlights that theyre not-for-profit but donor funded. One of the donors is the Segal Family Foundation, though theyre trying to figure out a way of being self-sufficient by outsourcing some work from other organizations.
 When the program first kicked off, everything was free. But, with time, WITU introduced a fee. This, Irene says, was to make them interested in what they are doing because it was completely free so people used not to take it seriously by the attending irregularly.
 The fee is 20,000/- of which UGx. 10,000 is for them to get an Identity Card and the remaining UGx. 10,000 is for graduation facilitation.
 While talking about success stories from the various cohorts, Irene admits that their success stories may not be popular names in the country yet, but to us, they mean a lot.
 
 Some of them are girls that came with zero shillings but now own a business making 20k a day. At the end of each cohort, we have three objectives; Either you have started a business, improved your business, and or getting employed  Irene
 
 One of the challenges is that girls drop out in the middle of the program. Though, Irene is quick to add that some drop out for good reasons. For example, she cites, if someone gets a job in the middle of the training and she can not continue.
 The other crucial challenge is that some girls who would like to start their businesses dont have startup capital despite the fact the average startup capital is UGx. 300,000 for girls in the cohort programs.
 
 It is a big challenge, many write very good proposals but dont have money. So far, we have tried to get banks to get them some micro loans as well as in-house loans but it is not a lasting solution  Irene
 
 Meanwhile, they are looking for partners who can give them money, according to Irene. This includes the plan to approach the minister of gender for a partnership on their women empowerment program.
 Irene also adds that however, much they also try to get the girls funding, the past experience indicates that girls are very much committed when they inject in their own money.

The investment will be used for product development, scaling and growth.”
 Gamaroff is pleased with the progress made over the last few months at Centbee, “Our development roadmap is well defined with exciting payment and remittance products coming to market this year. We look forward to the next phase in our growth and development.”
 Centbee is a gold member of AlphaCode, powered by Rand Merchant Investment Holdings, which identifies, partners and grows disruptive and scalable fintech businesses. Head of AlphaCode, Dominique Collett said:
 “We are delighted that Centbee has attracted the interest of two of the world’s most prestigious investors in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. It certainly augurs well for the growth and development of Centbee and Bitcoin SV globally.”

"SHOCKING: Jumia Classifieds terminates all staff in Uganda, Shifting Operation to Kenya
","Jumia Group is undoubtedly the leading internet group on the continent. Buoyed by investments from Goldman Sachs, Millicom, Orange, CDC, MTN, and other investors, the Group has been bullish on what many had called the dark continent. (See also: M-Kopa, Jumia Among MIT 50 Smartest Companies of 2017).
 However, this seems to be coming at a huge cost. News reaching us is that Jumia classifieds ventures will shift operations of Ugandan market platforms to Kenya, starting this Friday. 
 This comes after the venture served all its employees with letters terminating their contracts.
 The communication was made by the country manager, Stefano Polimeno, who took over from Shakib Nsubuga in March this year. 
 In a letter, a copy we got ahold of, Stefano cites a high level of spend and the need to reduce operational costs as the reasons for terminating the employees contracts. The full letter reads;
 
 RE: NOTIFICATION OF TERMINATION
 In reference to the above, this letter confirms our discussion that you are laid off from your employment with Jade E-Services  classifieds Uganda effective November 10th 2017.
 Currently, there is a high level of spend, therefore, we need to reduce operational costs and business. Unfortunately, the current expenditure in Uganda is also too high compared to the volume of sales we are achieving.
 As a result, Jumia Classifieds is downsizing and restructuring all departments in line with the new strategy and reduction in budget.
 As of your employment contract;
 
 
 Youll receive one months full pay with this notice.
 
 
 Youll be compensated for the remaining leave days you have not yet accrued
 
 
 In return, prior to exiting the firm, you will return to Jumia;
 
 
 The Jumia owned laptop loaned to you to carry out company work
 
 
 The Jumia owned mi-fi loaned to you to carry out company work (if applicable)
 
 
 Any other Jumia owned devices and properties
 
 
 We want you to know that this layoff is not a statement about your work for Jade E-Services. You have been a dedicated, contributing employee.
 If you wish to speak on your behalf to potential employers, we shall be happy to do so.
 Please let us know if we can assist you during your transition.
 We wish you well in your future endeavors.
 
 Jumia Classifieds  a combination of Jumia Jobs, Jumia House, and Jumia Deals  has seen a lot of staff loss ever since Shakib Nsubuga left as the country manager.
 
 Picture of the letter terminating the contract of one of the Jumia Classifieds employees.
 
 Four employees out of the 10 as of March this year have left the venture to pursue their own endeavors. None of which has got replaced to date.
 If this happens, this Friday, it means the 6 people that have been remaining and directly employed by Jumia Classifieds in Uganda stand to get unemployed. 
 It should also be noted that earlier this year, One Africa Media Groups BrighterMonday and Cheki closed shop in Uganda. All these were classifieds platforms one of which  BrighterMonday  was directly competing with Jumias Jumia Jobs. 
 Yet, the fact that classifieds ventures are scaling back from the Ugandan market should be a point to ponder.
 But, all this is happening as Taxify  a ride-hailing platform  has just launched in the country. (See also: Is this Why BrighterMonday Closed the Ugandan Office?).
 
 Before you go, we have a clarification to make
 Earlier today [11/08/2017], we erroneously reported that Jumia Classifieds Uganda was closing operations in Uganda. The article also pointed out that the e-commerce arm of Jumia in Uganda was depending on the performance of Jumia Market. Otherwise, it was closing in December this year.
 In a meeting with the management of Jumia in Uganda, they clarified that Jumia Classifieds platforms will continue to operate  though managed from Kenya. They also informed us that the e-commerce platforms are not closing. We trusted a source that turned out not to be well versed in the matter.
  We deeply regret and apologize for that mishap and damages it may have caused. But, we remain committed to giving you truthful, fact-based and well-researched startup information in Uganda and Africa. [End]

"In Brief: Chipper Cash co-founded by Uganda&#8217;s Ham Serunjogi closes $2.4M Seed round
","The African no-fee, cross-border payment startup Chipper Cash has raised a $2.4 million seed round led by Deciens Capital. The payments company also persuaded 500 Startups and Liquid 2 Ventures—co-founded by Joe Montana—to join the round.
 Chipper Cash was co-founded by Ham Serunjogi, a Ugandan  who doubles as the CEO  and Ghanaian Maijid Moujaled.  The startup offers no-fee, P2P, cross-border mobile-money payments in Africa.
 In a conversation with Digest Africa last year, Ham mentioned that they are looking to make it seamless to move money across the continent. There is no reason why someone who is on MTN has to go and get cash to send to someone who is on Airtel, Ham wondered.
 He also pointed out that they were looking to do to moving money what WhatsApp did to texting. Years ago, people were very cautious on how long a text message would be. But today, with Whatsapp, you type as freely as you want, Ham said
 Based in San Francisco based startup—with offices in Ghana and Nairobi—Chipper Cash has processed 250,000 transactions for over 70,000 active users, according to Serunjogi.
 In conjunction with the seed round, Chipper Cash is launching Chipper Checkout: a merchant focused, C2B, mobile payments product.

"UPDATED: Gebeya acquires Coders4Africa to fuel its expansion across Africa
","Gebeya, a software developer marketplace, yesterday announced its acquisition of Coders4Africa. A network of software and app developers.
 Gebeya Inc. (Gebeya) is excited to announce that it has acquired CODERS4AFRICA Inc. (C4A), wrote Gebeya in the press release.
 With the acquisition, the Ethiopian startup is looking to leverage the network Coders4Africa has built over time. This they will use  to further accelerate its growth and fuel its developer talent pool into its marketplace.
 As part of the acquisition, Gebeya will take over the network of software developers spread across the continent.
 
 Gebeya is inheriting both C4A’s 3,500 plus network of African developers in 6 (six) countries that C4A galvanized over the past 7 (seven) years,Gebeya wrote. Additionally, it will also have access to C4A’s global partners.
 
 With this in its corner, Gebeya believes its expansion plans across the African continent will be a lot more smooth and faster. With this acquisition, Gebeya is able also to prepare more efficiently and rapidly its expansion in more African countries.

 Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed in the press release. But, we have reached out to Amadou Daffe, CEO of Gebeya, for the details and will update this as soon as he gets back to us.
 But, commenting on the acquisition  in the press release  Amadou said;
 C4A and Gebeya bring together a proven track record in designing, deploying and evolving training for software engineers, that lead to success in the real-world market for software and systems development
 While Coders4Africas CEO, Yusuf Bashir, said that they have trained thousands of African developers. Yet, the opportunities are what is missing for their community. He, thus, believes that this acquisition by Gebeya, thatll be worked on.
 One of the challenges we faced after growing the largest network of software developers in the continent, was to find a way to give the developers job opportunities,” said Yusuf Bashir.
 Established in 2016, Gebeya is among the many software talent marketplaces sprouting across the African continent. The startup has its headquarters in Addis Ababa with offices in Kenya, UK, and the US.
 According to Amadou, the startup has so far raised at least $1 Million in funding. The one million came from a seed round. We have raised additional funding since the $1M privately but choose not to disclose the amount, said Amadou.
 Though, he maintained that they will soon disclose the details of a significant they have raised. We are hoping to make an announcement of closing a significant round in the next couple of months.
 Though, so far, the amount raised by Gebeya, when compared to Andelas over $81 Million, the latter trumps the former. Thus forging partnerships and acquisitions could Gebeyas answer to Andela which is rapidly expanding across Africa.

 UPDATE:
 We reached out to Amadou Daffe and he informed us that he wasnt at liberty to disclose the details of the acquisition deal. We are not in liberty [sic] to say [the terms of the acquisition], unfortunately. It was part of the deal [we signed] with C4A, he wrote.
 Additionally, we had quoted CrunchBase which indicated that Gebeya had so far raised at least $7 Million in funding. Amadou said that it wasnt true. Though acknowledged the $1 Million seed round and also said they have raised additional funding since then but privately. We have since updated the article to reflect that.

"Here&#8217;s why Ugandan hubs are coming together
","There’s a growing list of bodies uniting startup ecosystem enablers across the continent. Yet, few within the countries. This is partly because enablers within countries look at each other as competitors, rather than potential collaborators. However, BICU, an association to unite Ugandan hubs, is looking at cultivating the collaboration spirit.
 AfriLabs, in their 2016 annual gathering report, recommended that “hubs must not see themselves as competitors but collaborate [instead].” This was one of the proposed pathways to ensuring that hubs across the continent become sustainable. Seeing that majority of them are struggling to become self-sustaining.
 Two years later, Ugandan hubs are coming together once again under BICU, Business Innovation Consortium Uganda.
 “Business Innovation Consortium Uganda was started as early as 2012,” says Richard Zulu, the founder of Outbox Hub and the current head of BICU. “By that time, it was a discussion that was born out of StartupWeekend.”
 Initially, in 2012, the association had 7 members; Mara Launchpad, FinAfrica, Hive Colab, Outbox Hub, Grameen Foundation, The Hub Kampala and Makerere University Software Incubation Centre. But, some have since gone off the scene.
 “The main reason was how do we come together as players supporting entrepreneurship and collectively have a common voice that promotes advocacy, visibility around the kind of work we were doing but actually in a way [that] plays as a standard,” said Richard Zulu.
 “So we came together and brainstormed and the conclusion was that it is very important to be together. But we have to do it in such a way that we complement what the [other BICU] members are doing.”
 On its first attempt, the association members carried out a few initiatives together.
 “I think we held one or two events together and the value was to bring the communities together to learn from each other,” said Richard.
 Yet, immediately after, members started going in different directions. Something Richard attributes to the lack of demonstration of value to the members. “I believe where we fell short just like any other association is the value,” Richard pointed out.
 “How do you demonstrate value to your members? These are busy people. Why should they put effort into this? So it went quiet.”
 In their second attempt, the association now wants to focus on giving value to each member. One of the things they hope each member to enjoy is the collective advocacy and lobbying. Especially with the central government.
 “We felt that despite the fact that have been here as members, one of the most important players in the ecosystem [government] needs to recognize us,” Richard said.
 Governments role in the growth of a Startup Ecosystem cannot be overlooked. Thats why it is necessary that enablers have a healthy relationship with it. Yet, before deciding to come together, hubs were engaging the government individually.
 “We were having different conversations with government around different things and we felt that it is not effective advocating individually,” Richard said.
 When they sat on the table, they thought that we rather have a common voice where we advocate for visibility and the kind of audience that we need.”
 Another recommendation that was made in the AfriLabs 2016 Annual General Report was that “government(s) must support [hubs] in terms of policy.” But, they also added that hubs “have to be clear about what governments have for us” as well as the “need to challenge what they [governments give to us.”
 Richard also thinks that hubs shouldn’t look at each other as a competitor, rather, a collaborator.
 “We have carved out [our position in the ecosystem] as individuals but collectively as enablers, we have to have that kind of positioning.” That kind of positioning that Richard talks about cannot be easily achieved alone.
 Currently, the association has 5 members. These include Resilient Africa Network, Innovation Village, Hive Colab, and Women in Technology Uganda. Going by the figure put out by GSMA in their 2018 report, at least 10 haven’t yet joined.
 Read more: There are 442 active tech hubs in Africa, GSMA 2018 report
 “We havent yet interested Design Hub [and others] in becoming a part of the association,” Richard said. “But definitely, these are some of the things we are looking into.”
 He says that they are “still in the process of formalizing [the membership processes].” Though, points out that “the current status was driven by members who have entrepreneurial initiatives beyond just co-working.”
 In its current format, a hub can only join through invitation or application. There’s no definite process. “It is still up for discussion on whether one should apply to join or just get invited to join,” Richard says. Adding that “I think in my opinion it is both.”

 In his own estimates, Unreasonable East Africa has helped startups secure over $5 Million in funding since its inception in 2013. Of which, some have raised either grant or venture capital or both.
 In a conversation, Ivan was able to explain why and when one considers either grant or venture capital.
 First all, Ivan makes it clear that the type of funding one should opt for depends on what particular need that entrepreneur or startup has. For example, if one is looking to pilot a solution in an early phase, Ivan advises that a grant is ideal for that person.
 According to Ivan, grant is the cheapest capital one can get, so if theres an opportunity to raise it, then you should.
 However, it doesnt mean that any business model qualifies for a grant. Some models are suitable for equity investment or what you may refer to as venture capital, Ivan adds.
 He also highlights that there are businesses whose model qualifies for equity but also has a strong social impact story.
 Such startups can then consider taking up grant opportunities, Ivan says.
 Another thing that one should look at is the cash flow  if it is strong or not. For strong cash flow, equity investment is advised.
 Yet, if you have a strong impact story combined with strong cash flows, automatically you stand a chance to easily access grant capital.
 Ivan also notes that before you can consider any of the above, be ready to inject in your own capital  which may be from personal savings or friends and family.
 Because there are very few research and development grants around, not forgetting that very few people are willing to bring in equity funding unless one has a minimum viable product, Ivan says.
 Alternatively, for people that may not be able to afford the initial start capital, he advises they consider going for competitions that focus on ideas solely.

"What ALA&#8217;s “The Young Entrepreneurs Fund” means for African entrepreneurship  
","Fred Swaniker is a great friend of mine. Not only do we both originate from the centre of the earth (Ghana), we both had stints at Stanford University  though, at different times.  
 And, like me, he quickly returned to Africa to start the African Leadership Academy (ALA) in his quest to solve the African leadership conundrum. Fred reckons African leadership has deteriorated and is determined to reverse the trend. Recently, he was named a pioneer in TIME100 for 2019 for leading this charge. 
 We were also both fellows of TED Global and were both utopia ten years ago and so were the other African TED Global presenters like Dr. George Ayittey who postulated the “Cheetah Generation”, Patrick Awuah who dreamed of a new African tertiary educational system, William Kamkwamba who would harvest the wind to solve Africa’s power crisis  which were all part of “The Next Chapter”.
 In 2011, ALA partnered with the Mastercard Foundation to establish the Anzisha Prize  and now Anzisha Summit. The goal for both was to bring together the relevant stakeholders to not only discuss the issues around youth entrepreneurship and innovation. But, more importantly, award the entrepreneurs with prize money to help them get off their feet. 
 Some of these stakeholders include government, academia, private sector and civil society who were all represented at the summit. You can find the recent winners of the Anzisha Prize here
 As destiny would have it, along the way, I also became friends with Josh Adler. He was part of Fred’s team that was building the Africa Leadership Academy as Vice President for Growth and Entrepreneurship. Josh and I had numerous conversations about growth and entrepreneurship in Africa and how we should infuse that into the next generation of African leaders that they were grooming. We concluded that it was important to give the entrepreneurs in their academy a head start. 
 Africa’s educational system does not do enough to turn the entrepreneur’s urge on and there is little to no infrastructure in educational development for those who want to express themselves in free enterprise. So, the majority of Africa’s entrepreneurs have had to figure it out themselves by dint of grit and following their nose. 
 On February 1, 2019, while in a board strategy session with one of our portfolio companies, my phone starts ringing off the hook. There was Josh with the pleasant news that they have now developed an entrepreneurship program at ALA that they were going to launch at the Anzisha Summit. He wanted to discuss how we could work together because the dream has taken shape. 
 On April 15, 2019, ALA held the one-day Anzisha Summit at Hilton Hotel in Johannesburg which I attended and took part as a participant on the investor panel. You can find more details about the summit from CNBC Africa live coverage and the Anzisha scenario page.
 Through a series of back and forth, Josh and his team at ALA have put together an amazing program to not only educate but also accelerate young entrepreneurs on the path to private enterprise. 
 The program  dubbed “The Young Entrepreneurs Fund”  developed in partnership with Omidyar Network, was announced at the Anzisha Summit. It is modelled on Endeavors Catalyst Fund and based on a matching model: It will match  dollar for dollar  any investments into high potential young Africans by angels and early-stage investors.
 The fund will never lead a funding round. Instead, they will rely on the matching investor to have evaluated the merits of the business case. 
 They will also do limited due diligence on the entrepreneur. Per Josh, some of the areas for due diligence include: “the (entrepreneur’s) good standing in the community; the business has to be registered; can we get our money in/out.” Investments will also be limited to alumni of ALAs diploma program and Anzisha Prize. In cases where there are other shareholders, the alumnus has to be a significant shareholder or founder.
 The Young Entrepreneurs Fund is looking to contribute not more than 49% of a single funding round with a preference of around 25% with the ticket sizes ranging from US $5k to US $50k. 
 Although the fund is primarily looking at equity investments, they also have a preference for doing some sort of debt instrument. Overall, the fund hopes to deploy around $500,000 in the next two years as they continue to evaluate its feasibility.
 “The idea is to drive liquidity into the age group, and encourage our strongest young leaders to go into entrepreneurship as well as hesitant investors to take a punt with us in the collective corner of the entrepreneur they will back,” said Josh Adler.
 This is very important for African entrepreneurship because young Africans will now have access to Capacity, Community and Capital to give them a head start, which is an important foundation for their entrepreneurial journey. 
 By providing young Africans with follow on capacity, community and capital to build leading African multinational enterprises, The Young Entrepreneurs Fund complements what we are already doing at Chanzo Capital. Ten years later, Fred and my utopianism seem to have found some expression in real life  at the intersection of Josh Adler!

"The developer of EzyBando App wants you to (happily) forget about USSD Codes forever, even offline
","
 
 I first met Julius when we moved our offices to the Innovation Village. One Saturday in September, as I was clacking away on my laptop, he approached me to review EzyBando. We went through it for a few minutes and identified areas needing improvement.
 This week, on Friday, he was back. He had an updated version of the app, and he asked me what I thought of it. We later met at the First Founders Lab where he introduced EzyBando to fellow founders in the room. (See also: Why I am launching Uganda’s first Founders Lab).
 Julius Mutumba Kato has been working on EzyBando for four years. It is an app that improves your user experience from the boring USSD that requires you to memorize codes.
 USSD based services take lead when it comes to successful tech innovations in Africa. This is due to its cost-effectiveness. Take the example of Mobile money services.
 Yet, despite this, the complexity of the menu-driven user experience makes it hard to use. This is what EzyBando aims to address.
 It provides a Graphical User Interface for the user when using the services, Julius says.
 When asked about the target, Julius says everyone who uses USSD services on a daily. And of course, he adds, has a smartphone or an Android device to be specific.
 Although MTN and Airtel have similar apps, Julius says he is aware. He points out that Ezy Bando still holds an advantage in several ways. One of which is that you can use the app even when offline.
 
 EzyBando works offline unlike the two. And, this new release combines the services for the two networks. Hence providing a seamless experience for someone who uses both networks, Julius said.
 
 Combining services of the leading telecom companies in the country is a plus. But, the ability to work offline might be the edge it has over both. Currently, you cant use either of the two telecoms apps offline.
 The new version, unlike the first one in 2014, has an airtime card scanner. This lets you scan airtime card voucher numbers using your smartphone camera. Though he thinks it is something that the telecoms might copy and paste  but will take them some time.
 It is not an impossible feature for the two competitors to add. But it could take some good time until its added, or even never, Julius added.
 The new version has less than 100 downloads so far. But Julius is optimistic itll perform better than the initial release. Released in 2014, the first version got over 200 downloads without any promotion.
 
 
 Challenges
 
 
 And, like any app developer in a developing market, Julius has his own challenges. 
 The biggest right now is that the app is limited by the USSD shortcodes. Yet the USSD API for Android is not fully available for third-party developers. So services like mobile money that don’t have this short-code cant be included in the app yet, Julius points out.
 The other challenge is finding the right partner(s). He laments that many see the app as a good idea, but are kept away by the complexity of monetizing it. This has left him to work alone on the application.

 Ive actually tried to work with a company I wont mention here but unfortunately, we did not go very far on it. This kept the app dormant for over two years until a few week ago that I resumed with some updates and published it again.
 Aside from MTN and Airtel, he says that theres no serious competition. Those that would be contending for the same position have not managed to survive. Yet, the same challenges that befell the would-be his competitors might be the same for him. 
 I’ve not seen any other serious competition around yet, there was one who I used to see but its no longer traceable, Julius says. USSD based services continue to grow in Uganda and all over Africa. And Julius believes the need for this type of solution will also increase. 
 He, of course, agrees that a partnership with a telecom company is inevitable. But he thinks this will be mostly due to the fact that the app is built on top of their services. So, any unfavorable change in the structure of their services can render the app useless.
 This is a great app, apart from the fact that it is not easy to monetize, can be copied and doesnt yet support mobile money. But, if he can not figure out a partnership with a telecom, maybe TrueCaller might be interested.
 Try out the app here and, Julius requests that you, leave a review

"GSMA new mapping tool to help operators locate uncovered regions
","According to GSMA, the end of 2017 saw the number of global mobile subscribers up to 5 billion. Over 60% of these subscribe to mobile internet services. 
 With a rapid increase in smartphone adoption as a result of lower device costs, there is further access to 3G/4G mobile broadband networks and services across Sub-Saharan Africa.
 While these statistics indicate a steady growth in the numbers, GSMA’s Mobile Connectivity Index highlights that 4 billion people are still offline. This can be attributed to the tough economic climate in the region. The cost of building and operating mobile infrastructure in rural areas is much more expensive compared to the urban ones.
 As mobile operators seek to grow their coverage and subscriber base in these remote areas, they struggle to identify the economically feasible locations. Which implies that they eventually lose large sums of money while producing fewer investment returns over time.
 It is on the basis of this that GSMA is launching Mobile Coverage Maps. A tool designed to allow mobile operators to easily estimate the precise location and size of uncovered populations. 
 The mapping tool currently hosts Nigeria and Tanzania based on the insights of Mobile Connectivity Index (MCI). An index which measures the performance of various countries against key enablers. These include; infrastructure, affordability, consumer readiness, and content and services. 
 It also shows that infrastructure is the lowest scoring enabler for both countries. Further countries are expected to be added over the coming months.
 How useful are Mobile Coverage Maps?
 The portal provides detail to population settlements and existing mobile coverage. It is designed to support the players in the deployment of connectivity solutions to the underserved. 
 In addition, to provide coverage insights on key points of interests such as schools, hospitals, and refugee camps.
 Also Read: Mobile subscriber growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has slowed, GSMA report
 These maps should allow users to gain an accurate and complete picture of the mobile coverage by 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile technologies. Operators should as well be in the position to search for and estimate the population living in uncovered settlements.
 Furthermore, the maps should help stakeholders that rely on mobile connectivity to strategically target their activity when looking out for locations with existing coverage. 
 Given the numerous ways in which organizations are using mobile technology to improve lives, the tool should impact significantly on their social growth.
 As GSMA states, reliable population mobile coverage data is vital to identify who is covered and who is not. It is required for planning and financing network deployment.
 It is indispensable to determine how and where mobile technologies can be leveraged to deliver services. This is the starting point for enabling the digital economy.
 Likewise, the tool will benefit developers that aim for last mile service delivery and distribution to remote areas. This is precisely companies such as solar energy companies as well as telecom companies. Not to forget governments, NGOs, and private companies.
 As of December 2017, the subscriber base in the region totaled 444 million, about 9% of subscribers globally. GSMA predicts an increase in Sub-Saharan Africa’s population mobile subscription by 2025. This is in the latest edition of the GSMA’s Mobile Economy report series.
 The regional subscriber base is expected to grow up to 634 million. The penetration rate is forecast to reach 50% by the end of 2023, and 52% by 2025.

"Cape Town based Jumo closes $52M from Goldman Sachs
","Jumo, a company that offers loans to the unbanked in Africa, has closed $52 million in a venture round according to TechCrunch.
 Goldman Sachs led the round, though, there was participation from existing backers. This includes Proparco, Finnfund, Vostok Emerging Finance, Gemcorp Capital, and LeapFrog Investments.
 Jumo currently operates in seven African countries. This includes; South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
 To date, it claims to have helped 9 million consumers across all its markets in Africa and originated over $700 million in loans. The company also has a 350 staff across 10 offices in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

 Though they are looking to use the funding to further expand into Asia. So far, they have opened up an office in Singapore. This will likely be their headquarters, not only for the Asia Pacific market. This is because Andrew Watkins-Ball the founder and CEO states Singapore as his current location on LinkedIn.
 On why they are heading into Asia, Andrew pointed out the similarity between the markets in an interview with TechCrunch,
 We grew up in a very tough play yard,” he said in an interview. “We built our initial success in Tanzania which is probably one of the hardest [financial] markets in the world. A lot of these environments [in Asia] look more attractive.”
 When Paga recently closed $10 million, they, too, were looking at expanding beyond Africa. It is interesting that more and more African startups are having the outward look.
 Founded in 2014, this latest round of funding brings Jumos total funding raised to-date to at least $90 million. In April this year, the company also closed $3 million from PROPARCO.
 Jumo is likely the second company with Africa as its largest market, that Goldman Sachs has backed. That is after Jumia Group. Goldman participated in the companys €360M Series C they raised in March 2016.

"Mauritius, SA &#038; Nigeria top Africa&#8217;s 2018 E-commerce Index &#8211; Report
","The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has released a report on the global B2C E-commerce Index. According to the report, Mauritius, South Africa and Nigeria lead the rest of Africa.
 The UNCTAD B2C E-commerce Index measures an economy’s preparedness to support online shopping. Last year, it covered only 7 economies but expanded to include 151 this year. Fourty-four of these were from Africa.
 The index consists of four indicators. These are highly related to online shopping and for which there is wide country coverage.
 These include; Account ownership at a financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider. The consideration for this category is the percentage of the population aged 15 and above, with data sourced from the World Bank.
 The second is the number of individuals using the internet as a percentage of the population. The data used for this is from the International Telecommunication Union. Third is Postal Reliability with data sourced from the Universal Postal Union, UPU. The fourth indicator considered the security of internet servers per 1 million people. With the data sourced from Netcraft.
 Generally, the African region lags the rest of the world. With the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Norway topping the list.
 Mauritius – with a ranking of 55 – is the highest ranked African country on the list. While as many as nine of the bottom ten countries are in Africa.
 
 Yet, the continent is showing progress in key indicators related to B2C e-commerce. Since 2014, sub-Saharan Africa has surpassed world growth on three of the indicators. That is; number of accounts, individuals using the internet and secure internet servers.
 
 While Africa needs to boost Internet penetration to grow e-commerce, it also needs to get more of its existing Internet users to trust the online market for making purchases.
 
 The top 3 African countries each have a distinctive strength in one of the four areas measured by the index.
 Highest ranked Mauritius has a considerable 12 point higher score than the next African country. This small island developing state scores relatively high in all four areas, but particularly with regard to the share (90%) of the population having an account. In an effort to get more SMEs online, the Government launched a shopping portal in 2018 offering tax free purchases.
 Nigeria, the most populous African nation, ranks second. Largely thanks to a significant increase in postal reliability as measured by the Universal Postal Union. As Africa’s largest B2C e-commerce market  both in number of shoppers and revenue  reliable delivery of products is critical.

 Third placed South Africa is level with several other African countries for its Internet penetration. These are;  Cabo Verde, Gabon, Mauritius and Morocco. With each having around six in ten inhabitants using the Internet in 2017. South Africa leads by some margin in the number of secure Internet servers per one million people. An indication of websites accepting online sales and payments.
 The report also points out a weakness in the index. The indicators used may not be the most appropriate for Africa. For example, having an account may not be as important given the popularity of cash on delivery for e-commerce, it notes.
 
 Similarly, reliability of the national postal service may not always be critical if other alternatives are available. In Nigeria, e-commerce company Jumia has over 500 vehicles that deliver to customers in the largest cities.
 
 The other African countries to complete the top 10 were Tunisia, Morocco, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Botswana and Cameroon.

"What you need to know about the Tanzania Innovation Ecosystem
","In 2011, Buni Hub, Kinu Co-Creation Hub and Mara Space where the only players in Dar es Salaam with actual physical spaces to support urban entrepreneurs. The concept of working on startups and nurturing ideas was a new concept and each of these three hubs were testing which model works.
 They piloted different programs and activities to support entrepreneurs and develop entrepreneurial communities in Dar es Salaam with focus on technology and innovation.
 Things have changed a lot now; most global innovation ecosystem reports and maps still consider Tanzania among the countries with few spaces to support entrepreneurs. That was a fact a few years ago but it isn’t anymore.
 With spaces cutting across sectors, locations, and communities they serve, Tanzania innovation ecosystem is among the most diverse innovation ecosystems.
 From Data Labs, Arts Spaces, Living Lab, Community Spaces, Makerspaces, Creative Spaces, Incubators, and Accelerators; Technology Hubs are distributed across the country even in extremely rural areas.
 The innovation ecosystem has evolved to have a specific focus on female entrepreneurs and innovators with programs targeting young and adult women on innovation, tech and entrepreneurship.
 The most recent players in the area being Ndoto Hub and SafeSpaceco. They both offer support to women to develop their skills, build their confidence and explore opportunities.
 The existing players such as SheCodesForChange and Apps and Girls also continue to inspire more girls and young women in tech and leadership. Apps and Girls are working closely with Niwezeshe Lab another space in Dar es Salaam.
 
 
 
 Ndoto Hub
 
 
 
 Some of the spaces such as Kiota Hub at Tumaini University, Data Lab at the University of Dar es Salaam and AMCET Hub at the Al Maktoum College or Engineering. They work directly with academic institutions which bring about better collaboration between academia and the ecosystem.
 Data Lab priority focus is on data and how it is used to create impact. Kiota Hub helps to transform students ideas into early-stage business and AMCET Hub helps to build skills and capacity of the students by equipping them with in-demand skills.
 Read About: These are the 3 latest tech hubs in Tanzania’s eco-system
 The space of coworking is also growing; with new co-creation spaces, co-offices and even co-living spaces emerging. Seedstars have launched the first Seedspace in East and Central Africa in Tanzania.
 The hub serves entrepreneurs from across the region. With world-class facilities; working spaces, meeting rooms, guests facilities, small event venue etc. Sometime later this year it will launch a co-living space for entrepreneurs in the same building. The concept might be the first time being implemented in East Africa.
 
 
 
 &nbsp;
 Meeting With Maryam at Seedspace in Dar.
 
 
 
 The good news is that the growth is not witnessed in Dar es Salaam alone. In a city like Iringa already they have three spaces serving the community. Spaces like RLabs Iringa and Mkwawa Community Art Space also in Iringa.
 They serve the community at the grassroots level. Providing opportunities for youths to improve their livelihood and explore new opportunities with improved life skills. Mkwawa uses arts as a tool to empower young people.
 You also have spaces like Kilihub (Anza) in Moshi, Twende Makerspace in Arusha, Elimu Lab in Sengerema, Zanzibar Technology Business Incubator (ZTBI) in Zanzibar and Sokoine Agribusiness Incubator in Morogoro.
 Also, new programs to support post revenue entrepreneurs are coming in. Sahara Accelerator is a venture and corporate-backed accelerator with a special focus on support post revenue startups and developing corporate innovation programs including accelerators.
 The accelerator is currently housing three startups and supports virtually 12 startups. The accelerator is currently implementing three corporate sponsored acceleration programs; e-Kilimo Accelerator, Lishe Accelerator, and Inspire100.
 Previously, the accelerator also hosted Amua Accelerator and Mawazo Challenge. The approach is different from Dar Teknohama Business Incubator (DTBI) which incubate startups by offering them physical office space and technical support. DTBI was the first to be established as a business incubator in Tanzania.
 The ecosystem is also filled with events and meetups; Google Startup Grind, FinDisrupt, Sahara Header-File, Bits and Bytes, COSTECH STI Conference, HDIF Week and the Sahara Sparks event driving the growth of the ecosystem.
 Sahara Sparks this year will host AfriLabs which is the network of technology hubs across the African continent. The event is organized in parallel with AfriLabs Annual General Meeting (AGM).

 Corporate companies are also coming into the ecosystem with some starting their own innovation spaces to groom new ideas, the most recent is Smart Lab from Smartcodes.
 Telecom companies are also getting more involved with the ecosystem by working with entrepreneurs and innovation spaces, co-implementing programs and activities. Products such as Tigo Backup, Twende, Jamii Micro-Health Insurance, Visomo and Mpaper shows there are positive signs of collaboration between startups and telcos in Tanzania.
 Tanzania Bora and Mulika 255 play a crucial role on innovation in areas of youths on arts, governance, leadership, and journalism. They are disrupting the sectors by coming up with innovative approaches of engaging youths in discussions, creating new young leaders and developing new skills. On skills, there are also programs such as The Launch Pad and Buni Internship Program.
 Nafasi Arts Space, Kokoten Studio and Bongo Hub (Community) are among the players that champion arts in the ecosystem who are based in Dar. Another space is FASDO, Faru Arts and Sports Development Organization which works with communities in Temeke. The space work with youths in Temeke improving their livelihood through arts and sports.
 Making is also growing, the only makers we used to have was STICLab. Now we have the Robotech Lab, Projekt Inspire, and Buni Mini Makerspace. More kids are getting into making. These programs inspire the new generation of makers and scientists.
 STICLab played a crucial role in the implementation of the RefabDar project and the making of the first electronic waste 3D printers in Dar. They have also been selected to host the Africa Open Science and Hardware Summit.
 We are also not doing so bad in areas of drones and mapping; Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Tanzania and other partners are doing different mapping exercises in Tanzania.
 The drones sector is also growing with drones used in different projects; mapping lands, assessing flood risks, delivering medicines etc. Companies like Zipline and We Robotics are already in the country to explore the opportunity.
 Overall, things are happening in Tanzania and they are happening at a faster pace. What are the gaps and how we can address them?
 
 Sustainability: The major problem facing most of these initiatives if not all is sustainable models that will ensure they continue to operate and offer sustained value to the community and the beneficiaries of the programs. Some of the hubs especially the earlier ones have already closed the doors and no longer functioning. It is vital we think about sustainability before evening starting these programs and interventions. The best to ensure that is through learning from others and ensure a sustained value is created from the initiative, you pilot.
 Collaboration: Many stakeholders work in a silo, they don’t share information and they don’t create a pipeline of value to their beneficiaries. Most of the programs and activities are designed with players in the ecosystem. They don’t think on how to leverage value to other partners in the ecosystem which results to duplication of efforts and reduced quality of the programs and activities.
 Funding: It is a big issue to beneficiaries (entrepreneurs, innovators, tech enthusiasts etc) and organizations that support them; hubs, incubators etc. Lack of grants, AI and VC funds to support the ecosystem in multiple sectors hinders innovations to emerge from sectors which are less funded. There is a need to have more investment firms structured to meet the needs of the local ecosystem.
 Skills: Talents are needed, we need to invest more in people. We need to improve the quality of our education system. Our Universities need to invest more on skills development program. They need to engage more with other partners especially the industry to learn what is needed and how they can provide that to the students.
 Research and Development: There are less researched ideas and businesses in our ecosystem. There is no connection between commercial products and services with scientific researches. Scaling becomes a problem, investment becomes a problem since there is no clear data or information about the businesses. On the other hand, all the research from academic institutions doesn’t cross the campus gate.
 Policies and Regulations: We need to intentionally incorporate discussions around innovation as part of our national agenda and try to make it align with other agenda such as industrialization agenda. Innovation is a cross-cutting issue we cannot afford not to prioritize it.
 More private sector involvement: We need more local companies to embrace and support innovation ecosystems. To work with local innovators and entrepreneurs and collaborate with other stakeholders in the ecosystem.
 
 We have come so far but there is a lot of work that needs to be done from here onwards. Congrats to all those who are doing the amazing work to support the growth of our ecosystem.

"Egypt&#8217;s A15 sells its 76% stake in Dubai&#8217;s TPAY to Helios
","A15, a tech investment fund, has sold a 76% stake in U.A.E. based fintech company TPAY to Helios Investment Partners. There were no specific monetary details revealed.
 According to A15, the sale made it the first fund in the Middle East and Africa which created a Dragon from one of its investments, TPAY.
 By definition, a dragon is a company that returns an entire fund — a “fund maker.” While as unicorns are rare, dragons are 4x rarer.
 
 In this case, TPAY returned a multiple of the value of the entire A15 Fund to its investors, a liquidity event that is very rare in the global tech investment space and a first of its kind in the MENA region, wrote A15.
 
 But, this isnt the first exit for A15. The fund sold Otlob to Rocket Internet at $12 million in 2015  a price Wamda described as a bargain. Registered in Cayman Island and headquartered in Cairo, A15 currently has at least 17 ventures in their portfolio. In May this year, they participated in Wuzzufs $16 million Series B.
 TPAY is a direct carrier billing provider in the Middle East and North Africa region with headquarters in Dubai. Founded in 2014, the company has operations in at least 14 MENA countries.

 Although Helios will now have a controlling stake, it seems both will continue making the decisions.
 Following the acquisition by Helios Investment Partners, A15 and the current executive team will continue to lead the implementation of TPAY’s growth strategy, with guidance from the new owners, and both will remain invested in a total of 24% of the company, wrote A15.
 Helios is most known for its investment in Nigerias Interswitch. Yet, they have also been active across the continent this year, with investments in Zola Electric and Africell Holdings.
 Fope Adelowo, Helios VP, was at TechCrunchs Disrupt event this year and encouraged Silicon Valley investors to bet on Africas potential.

"What happened to Yoza App? [Part 1 of 3]
","I have thought long and hard about opening up on what happened to Yoza App. I have been asked by very many people if the service is still up and why we gave up so fast.
 
 
 “Resource allocation and innovation are 2 sides of the same coin.”  Clayton M. Christensen (The Innovator’s Dilemma)
 
 
 The only reason I have decided on sharing this is that every day I see very many founders struggle in silence. We come up with good ideas and start executing on them. We get a few customers and setup our social pages, then invite a few of our friends and family to try our products. We run around talking to the media to talk about our products mostly to get the word out and attract new customers.
 A few months go by and bills start piling up, co-founders get side gigs to keep the business going, the focus is obviously lost and motivation starts to go down. Your friends stop using your product, your site goes down and you are in this constant cycle of putting out fires.
 STOP!!!
 Yoza Founders Solomon (L), Nick (C), Isaac (R)
 The beginning
 I must say that this wasn’t us. We were dealt a somewhat good hand and to understand the fate of Yoza, I have to take you back to where everything started. This wasn’t my idea Solomon Kitumba pitched an idea of Village laundry service and if you have read Eric Ries’s The Lean Startup he talks about how laundry was done in Indian villages by putting consumer grade laundry machines at the back of a pickup truck packed at different street corner.
 I had just moved from an upcountry university to start my life in the Kampala and laundry was the one problem I had every weekend. I shared the problem Solomon had so I invested some money for an experiment  “Who does your laundry?” If we asked enough people who do their laundry, we would have a database of washers. We convinced my long-term partner in crime Kyuka Isaac to join as the 3rd co-founder and we were on our way to disrupt the laundry and dry cleaning service industry.
 MTN Partnership
 We entered the idea into MTN app challenge and won. We invested our spoils into acquiring customers, washers and building an app and websites where people would find us. We aggressively recruited 150 washers from 25 locations in Kampala, trained them and made them available for work.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 
 
 After winning MTN App Challenge.
 
 
 Partnering with MTN opened us up to very many opportunities like media coverage and it also gave our brand credibility as people wanted to try “this app that won the MTN challenge”.
 Working closely with the mobile money team and being one of the first apps to have direct integration with mobile money APIs was/is by far the best thing that happened to our product.
 Minimum viable product
 We launched the app to the public August 2015 and on the first weekend, we saw a lot of app installs on Saturday morning and a lot of app uninstalls in the week after. This pattern continued for a couple of weeks and we asked a few customers why they had uninstalled our app.
 
 “The app is so good that after I get the washer’s number, I don’t need you guys.”
 
 This however like most entrepreneurs tell themselves was a very good problem. Early days when you selected a location we would give you a list of washers in that area and when you selected someone you would directly give them a call in the app.
 
 
 An early version of the product. [Photo Credit: Techweez]
 
 This design was mainly because of the smartphone-feature phone technology divide between our customers and the washers.
 Subscription Model
 There was/is one common denominator among the people who installed and uninstalled the product. They all hated doing their laundry. This meant that they did laundry at least 3–4 times in a month.
 Based changed our revenue model to a monthly basis for customers and transactional the basis for the washers.
 The customers would try the service for the first 2 weeks for free and if they liked the service, they would subscribe for the next 3 months because they are going to do the laundry anyway why not pay upfront.
 This saved us the trouble of spending so much to acquire customers who would leave the weekend after their first install and it also secured traffic for the washers because we could guarantee them to work for at least 3 months. We also saw more customer retention and made back our cost of acquisition with a profit.
 This was working and all we had to do is go out and get more customers like these. The trade-off we made here was to resort to doing the work ourselves and manually handle the clients one by one as they signed up for the service. We were talking to every customer and got first-hand feedback and with the team doing the work, we could handle about 10 new customers each on a weekend.
 What could go wrong?
 What follows in part 2 is the fun part before sh*t goes crazy in part 3. This post first appeared on Nicholas Medium Account.

"MTN is considering selling off its 40% stake in Jumia
","South African telecom group, MTN is said to be considering selling off its stake in Africas online retailer, Jumia. That is according to reports by Bloomberg.
 MTN Group Ltd. is exploring a sale of shares in African online retailer Jumia, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg wrote.
 The company is said to be considering two options with the first one being listing Jumia. Africa’s largest wireless carrier is considering an initial public offering of the Amazon.com Inc.-style business on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, Bloomberg.
 Apparently, it isnt only MTN considering this option as German Incubator, Rocket Internet, which owns a minor stake in the company, is considering the option too. Smaller investors such as German startup backer Rocket Internet SE are also open to selling stock, Bloomberg.
 This wont be the first time the possibility of listing Jumia has been tossed around.
 Earlier this year, Reuters reported that Rocket Internet was considering listing the internet company. The listing was said to take place either later in 2018 or 2019. Though the exchanges in consideration were Frankfurt or London.

 The second option that MTN is looking to use to offload its stake is through looking for a private investor. Though this is not likely to be from the existing ones. Another option under consideration is a private sale of shares to new investors, according to the people, Bloomberg.
 Though, in an email exchange on Thursday with MTNs spokewoman, she told Bloomberg that the company “currently has no plans to dispose of its investment in Jumia in the short term.
 MTN is the biggest shareholder in Jumia with a 40% stake and the company currently values the internet company at $1 Billion. According to Bloomberg, Jumia has grown sales by between 70 percent and 90 percent annually since its inception in 2012.
 The telecom company could be exploring the idea in search for liquidity.
 According to Bloomberg, MTN is hoping that listing Jumia can help reduce its debt. A successful listing could help MTN reduce debt, which increased to 69.8 billion rand ($4.8 billion) at the end of June, compared with 57.1 billion rand six months earlier.
 In May this year, Bloomberg reported that MTN was looking to raise $1.1 Billion in debt in Nigeria in 2018. Nigeria is the MTN Groups biggest market of all its 21 in Africa and Middle East.
 So far, they have managed to close $552 Million from a consortium of 12 Nigerian banks. Which is half the amount the group is seeking.
 According to CrunchBase, Jumia has raised at least $760 Million in funding. They first raised a €40 Milllion series A in 2012 from Rocket Internet, Milicom and Blackeney Management.
 Series B of €130 Million was raised in 2013 from Millicom, MTN and Rocket Internet. This was followed by a $150 Million Series C at a pre-money valuation of $405 Million from Summit Partners, Rocket Internet, Orange, Millicom Systems, MTN, Goldman Sachs, CDC Group and AXA Group.
 The company followed this up with $326 million in funding in 2016 from Goldman Sachs, MTN, Rocket Internet and a couple of other existing investors.

"Andela Raises $40M in CRE Capital Venture Led Series C Round
","Andela, has today announced that it secured $40M in a recently concluded Series C funding round.
 The investment round led by venture firm CRE Venture Capital also had the participation of DBL Partners, Amplo, Salesforce Ventures, and Africa-focused TLcom Capital. Existing investors including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GV, and Spark Capital also participated.
 The round, which marks one of the largest investments ever led by an African venture firm into an Africa-based company, brings Andela’s total venture funding to just over $80M.
 Andela was launched in 2014 to combat the global technical talent shortage by investing in Africa’s most talented software developers. With an estimated 1.3M software jobs unfilled in 2016 in the U.S. alone, it’s clear that the growth of today’s major technology ecosystems is inhibited by a severe lack of talent.
 To solve this, Andela invests in high potential pools of brainpower across the African continent to help more than 100 partner companies build distributed engineering teams. These partners range from industry leaders like Viacom and Mastercard Labs to high-growth technology companies such as Gusto and GitHub.
 With offices in Lagos, Nigeria, Nairobi, Kenya, and Kampala, Uganda, Andela has hired 500 developers to date  the top 0.7% of more than 70,000 applicants from across the continent.
 Selected developers spend six months in a rigorous onboarding program before being matched with one of Andela’s partner companies as full-time engineering team members.
 Beyond recruiting elite development talent, Andela is catalyzing the growth of tech ecosystems across the continent by open-sourcing its content and partnering with organizations including Google, Pluralsight and Udacity to provide resources and mentorship to developers.
 “In the two years since we launched Andela Kenya, we’ve already become home to three hundred brilliant engineers who are redefining the meaning of leadership on the continent and building a reputation for technological excellence,” says Joshua Mwaniki, Country Director of Andela Kenya.
 “When we look back at the key drivers that turned Kenya and Africa into economic giants, Andela will remembered not as a footnote in the story, but as a major catalyst.”
 Pule Taukobong, Founding Partner of CRE Venture Capital, adds: “At present, there is more capital to fund ideas globally than there are people to build them. Andela is providing a solution to this global talent dilemma while building a business case for one of Africas greatest assets: our people.”
 Andela will use the capital to fuel its aggressive expansion plans: The company aims to launch offices in two additional African countries over the next year, doubling its developer base from 500 to 1,000 to meet growing demand.
 Alongside this round, Pule Taukobong of CRE, Julia Gillard, former Australian Prime Minister and Amplo Board Partner, and Omobola Johnson, Senior Partner at TLcom and former Minister of Communication Technology in Nigeria, will be joining Andela’s board.
 Andela is a software engineering company that helps other companies build high-performing engineering teams by investing in Africa’s most talented software developers.
 With this series C round, the company is now backed by CRE Venture Capital, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Spark Capital.
 CRE Venture Capital, founded by Pule Taukobong and Pardon Makumbe, invests in tech companies in Africa. With its relationships and experience, it aims at helping founders to build African tech companies with global relevance and impact.
 Currently, the firm has investments in Andela, Flutterwave, Rensource, Yoco and Oradian.

"UPDATE: Kampala Innovation Week 2017 Kicks off tomorrow, here are some details you need to know
","Kampala Innovation Week (KIW) is set to become an annual event to bring together all players from across the different sectors that make up the startup ecosystem for a week. Pioneered by the Innovation Village, itll be a joint effort by all the hubs in Uganda.
 This years will take place at The Innovation Village, Design Hub Kampala in Industrial Area and at Outbox Hub along Lumumba Avenue.
 This is the first edition and set to feature over 50 speakers, corporate innovators, representatives from the public sector, industry thought leaders, experts, entrepreneurs, investors as well as startups from Uganda and the region.
 These will collectively explore the opportunities to work together to build a connected ecosystem, which is one of the missing gaps in grooming sustainable startups.
 At the core of Kampala Innovation Week is the fundamental belief that Innovation can be a transformational tool to solve the biggest challenges in the private, public, academia and civil society. It will highlight existing solutions that solve real local challenges while creating the motivation for new solutions to be built for those challenges not yet solved.
 
 Meet Mr. Hiremath; legendary Indian innovator with 670 innovations to his name. He releases two innovations a month &amp; gifts some of the patents to young entrepreneurs!

"Is Uganda&#8217;s SafeBoda paying the price for hasty scaling?
","If youre working on a product that can scale overnight, it is no doubt youll think of scaling. Therefore, SafeBoda recent scaling wasnt a question of if they would, it was when. Which they are currently still doing.
 The startups scaling has been both vertical and horizontal  in Uganda and Kenya respectively. Though at a cost.
 However, important to note is that almost all companies that scale  from history  face challenges. For technology startups, the issues center around the quality of hires and the product robustness.
 In 2016, Uber scaled to cover at least 400 cities and 70 countries with over 6000 employees, 2000 of whom were engineers. Only a year and a half before, the company had just 200 engineers. Yet, they didnt scale without problems.
 In fact, Matt Ranney, the companys Chief Systems Architect then, confessed that lots of mistakes have been made along the way.
 In February 2016, an Uber driver was accused of killing six people in a Kalamazoo, Michigan. This raised concerns about the companys background checks.
 Also read: Pitch perfect, a Ugandan online show focused on innovators, launches
 Which reminds of the fact that in the past two months, I have taken SafeBodas with drivers I can classify as half-baked;
 One  in July  almost crashed into a trailer along Ntinda-Nakawa road. While another, that I took last week, drove on the pavements at Kabira Country Club. There have also been several incidents of some driving past red traffic light.
 Yet these incidents are only increasing in the past few months because all my encounters with SafeBoda drivers below number 1500 have yielded perfect rides.
 This can be traced to early this year.
 Theres no doubt that SafeBodas product is on demand. In a conversation with one of the co-founders, he told me that however fast they are growing, they cant seem to match the demand. Even Uber had these issues.
 
 Dear London: we r far from perfect but we have 40k licensed drivers and 3.5mm Londoners depending on us. Pls work w/us to make things right
 — dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) September 22, 2017
 In a bid to match the growing demand, the startup raised a round of $1.1 million (which they denied) to enable them to recruit more drivers among other things. This number has been growing at an unprecedentedly fast rate.
 Currently, they have at least 5000 riders, going by the numbers I see on their helmets.
 Though, it seems that in an effort to grow, they slacked on quality assurance. This has greatly affected their service, given theres a very distinct difference between the older (1500) and new (1500+)batch of SafeBoda riders.
 The startup admitted to this, calling it an inconsistency in customer experience.
 
 Dear @SafeBoda its high time you did something about your service before it collapses. This guy was a real nuisance. He either needs training or a firing. He lied, took someone else and made me lose an appointment. You guys are good but such will collapse you. Do the needful pliz pic.twitter.com/XmlWqdygn5
 — Tony Kent Kyazze (@tonykentkyazze) September 2, 2018
 They pointed out that their quality assurance team was growing and working tirelessly to test and retrain SafeBodas in customer care and app use to ensure a good quality service, every time.
 That was exactly a month ago. And, a few things have been corrected here and there.
 Though, another issue that perhaps was pressing for attention is the technology.
 Getting a SafeBoda between two and one month ago was a great pain. Either they could assign you a driver miles away or the app would return no rider. Even when you could see someone across the street.
 When I spoke to someone familiar with the company, I was informed that it was a result of a technical error. And, they were hiring a good number of engineers to join their local team. They also followed this up with looking for at least 8 engineers in Barcelona.
 Alastair Sussock, SafeBodas co-founder and co-CEO, told me that the move to hire in Barcelona was to scale the SafeBoda platform and provide more services to drivers and passengers in Kampala and across East Africa.
 Yet, last week, they were hit by another technology-related issue. Some of SafeBoda users found out that they were being overcharged. SafeBoda blamed this on a technical error saying that We have fixed the overcharge app bug!
 
 Dear Customers, over the last couple of weeks, you may have experienced a trip overcharge on the app. We are happy to inform you that this has now been fixed &amp; apologise for any inconveniences caused, SafeBoda wrote on their social media platforms.
 
 Like I wrote before, when you look at history, all startups that have scaled rapidly in the past have had challenges. However, they  most, if not all  managed to maneuver them but at a price.
 Groupon CEO was fired, Ubers co-founder and CEO had to be fired while Facebook had to get its senior engineers away from their daily work to mainly focus on its new hires in 2006 until they were confident they could deliver.
 Therefore, what is happening to SafeBoda is perfectly normal. The only question should be; For how long will it go on? And, what will it cost the company before they get back on the right track?

"5 Reasons Why Your Start Up is not Attracting Local Funding
","Over the past two years, GoBigHub, in its mission to connect local micro-investors to local micro-entrepreneurs, has realized certain traits of local startups, which hinder their ability to attract financing, and or, to grow big.
 We have since classified them into the five common pitfalls as below;
 
 Investor readiness versus Lack of Capital
 
 Most start-ups, instead of working to be investor ready, are more focussed on bemoaning the alleged lack of capital. This is a cultural issue, an over-repeated narrative that now has found its way into the psyche of the business owners.
 At GoBigHub, the investor pitch form that entrepreneurs fill, is basically built around the idea of testing the business system in the company. With questions such as: are you registered legally? Where is your customer database? How do you acquire customers? How do you grow customers? How do you invest your profits? and many more.
 These are questions which address the business as a system that generates wealth, and hence, attracts an investor to invest.
 
 Systems versus Products
 
 Most startups focus more on the products and their packaging features rather than the system that sources, produces, packages, and sells the products to generate wealth and prosperity to the investors.
 This is a sad reality, especially given that for a good product, an entrepreneur might get an accolade or appreciation, but for a good system, the entrepreneur will get investment, which is what they really need.
 At GoBigHub, we ask start ups looking for investment to focus on their systems, and we connect the startups to local professionals who volunteer one hour per month, to talk to them, sharing their experiences  through our free mentor-ship program called Inua Kijana Fellowship.
 
 Sales versus Innovation
 
 Most startups focus on innovation, product development, and further product development. They focus on better features of apps, and better quality of product, and on winning awards on how great and innovative they are.
 Indeed, most startups are constantly winning competitions on most innovative wards, but have no sales. Sales is everything. Without sales, there is no revenue, no profits, and no return on investment to investors.
 The purpose of a company is to generate wealth, by solving a need of a class of customers. Companies, or startups, that are starting with no sales, will die because of no sales.  At GoBigHub, we do not allow startups with no sales record to pitch to investors, as these are not already wet, with no skin in the game, and no minimum effort.
 
 Active networking versus lack of business skills
 
 Most startups lack strategic skills to expand and grow the business, but instead of actively participating in business networking sessions to learn through pep-talk engagement, they are constantly deriding the systems around them for lack of skills and end up not growing their businesses.
 There is need for active networking, and learning amongst equals. Networking is key. It enhances leverage, and collaboration. At GoBigHub, we organize the GoBig Cocktail, a monthly event where entrepreneurs get to meet with fellow entrepreneurs, and share their insights, while also interacting with potential investors.
 We also connect entrepreneurs to skilled experts, under the mentor-ship program  Inua Kijana Fellowship  so they can learn basics in their industry from people who have been there.
 
 Risk management plan versus business losses
 
 Risk is inherent in any venture, and for businesses which apply capital to production, there are multiple risks. Some risks are straight forward, while others are hidden and unclear. There is need for start ups to have clear definition of their risks and their plans to manage the risks.
 Most start ups do not have clear statement of their risks, and consequently, do not have risk management plans, or systems to reduce risk. GoBigHub does a two stage due diligence process to identify and minimize risk, namely cash-flow due diligence.This confirms whether the company has generated revenue, net positive profits and net positive cash-flow.
 This proves the business is no longer an idea but a system. The next level of due diligence is legal/regulatory due diligence. This focuses on whether the business has legal personality, character of founders, their physical addresses, legal registration of business, tax payment status, payment of licenses, etc. This ensures that the entrepreneur and the enterprise, is legitimate.

"Africa Tech Ventures closes $7.5M from AfDB for seed-stage investments
","The African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a $7.5 million investment into Africa Tech Ventures (ATV).
 The equity investment is part of the Boost Africa Investment Program. A joint collaboration between AfDB, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank  which has already committed US$10 million to the Fund.
 ATV states that they invest between $100,000 and $5million. But, in exchange for a significant minority equity stake and can take part in multiple financing rounds. The fund will, thus, use the funding to make seed investments in startups that are operating in key sectors.
 The funds focus of investment is into tech-enabled startups that provide essential goods and services, like education, employment, energy, logistics, agriculture, healthcare and financial services. The goal, according to the bank, is to boost operations of highly scalable companies on the continent.
 
 The overarching goal of ATV is to expand economic opportunities for African youth by providing 15 to 20 start-ups with capital throughout their growth cycle. This will enable them to grow from 1 thousand to 1 million users.
 
 The fund is headquartered in Nairobi office, which explains why a majority of them are also based in Kenya. To date, Africa Tech Ventures  on their website  lists 11 startups as part of their portfolio. These include; Twiga Foods, Sendy, Cellulant, FarmDrive, mSurvey, Eneza Education, Pezesha and more.
 Eline Blaauboer, alongside fellow managing partner Mairead Cahill, launched the fund close to two years ago.
 Since then, they have been on a drive to close a $50 million fund. According to the press release from AfDB, this particular investment is part of that $50 million. It intends to hold a first closing in the second quarter of 2019 and a final closing 12 months thereafter.
 AfDB is increasingly backing funds geared towards high-growth potential startups. In October, the bank announced that they had invested €7 million into Partech Africa Fund. The bank has always stressed that the investments are part of their “efforts to channel critical investment funding to Africa’s entrepreneurs.”
 This article had stated that the fund is headquartered in the Netherlands. It has since been corrected to Nairobi.

 But, the center could go a long way to address that if it meets the stated figures.
 According to SafeBoda, the facility is the  first of its kind in East Africa. They also pointed out that with the center, it now has the capacity to train up to 1,000 boda-boda drivers a week. Adding that they are looking at training over 50,000 boda-boda riders in the next 12-months.
 Competition in the ride-hailing space in East Africa  especially boda-boda  is growing. But, many that are joining seem to be lacking in the basics like safety and uniformity in the code of conduct among their drivers.
 One can cite the example of Taxify and Uber. The two launched their boda-hailing services in Uganda earlier this year with the aim of going after SafeBoda. But, it is not uncommon to see drivers for either not carrying a helmet for a passenger.
 Thus, with this facility, SafeBoda will only further strengthen their position as the market leader in the two-wheeler riding space.

"Bowmans and Citi bank hold their second fintech conference
","Bowmans and Citi bank have today [06/07/2017] held their second fintech conference. It took place at Skyz Hotel in Naguru, Kampala. The conference was largely attended by bankers, lawyers and other players in Ugandas fintech space.
 It sought to build on the momentum generated from last years conference. Which focused on a general introduction of what fintech is according to Brian Kalule, a partner at Bowmans Uganda.
 This is the second time we are having it, Brian told me. Adding that it is an annual conference but last time we did it as Bowmans alone.
 Held in partnership with FSD Uganda and Citi, this years focused on the ongoing trends in financial technology. Including cybercrime and data leakages.
 
 This year we went a little deeper into discussing the relevant trends like cybercrime. Theres been a lot of data leakages and financial information leaking going on. So we wanted to it relevant instead of giving a general outlook,  Brian Kalule.
 
 The conference had panel discussions tackling topics like fintech developments in Uganda and beyond, fintech and banking  whether they are friends or foes  and how to drive the digital economy. Part of the discussion also centered around cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
 Speakers included Kenneth Legesi from Deloitte, David Mushabe from SMSOne and School Pay, Kevin Lubega from EzeeMoney, Kwame Rugunda from Crypto Savannah and more.
 Though a fintech event, a detour was made to give room for a presentation about kira. An AI solution that Bowmans invested in this year. It is currently being tested to carry out the tedious work of document review.

 It will mainly be used to improve efficiencies in certain key legal processes, primarily in the mergers and acquisitions, private equity and compliance areas.
 According to Cathy Truter, from Bowmans South Africa, Kira can review over 2000 documents in under 30 minutes. A task that can take a human lawyer over a week to do, according to Brian Kalule.

"Pesapal​ ​to officially launch​ ​Sabi​ ​mPOS in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania
","
 Pesapal will tomorrow announce the launch of its mobile Point of Sale (mPOS) solution. The company had scheduled the launch in Kenya for the 26th of October. However, this coincided with the poll date for the presidential re-elections. 
 The company has thus decided to go with an online launch as they gear to an actual launch next year in January.
 The product to be launched is dubbed Pesapal Sabi. It allows businesses and individuals to process card payments in store. Or, on the go via their Android mobile phones or tablets
 
 
 Itll be available in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. It seeks to help businesses process card payments more efficiently. From mobile sole traders and SMEs to large multi-location retailers. The mPOS will go for USD 80 or UGx. 290,000 in Uganda.
 
 
 Currently, Sabi can process Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards. It can do this in both local currencies and US dollars.
 
 
  
 
 
 These card payments will be processed over Bluetooth connections via Sabi mPOS terminals. Which are also offered by Pesapal. The Sabi terminals are portable and can process over 250 transactions on a single charge.
 
 
  
 
 
 The terminals are able to process both chip and pin payments as well as NFC contactless payments. Business owners are then able to view their transaction histories. As well as issue receipts for their payments via the Android Sabi app. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Later versions of Sabi will support mVisa and American Express payments. Adding to the payment options businesses will offer their clientele.
 
 
  
 
 
 Pesapal has primarily offered online payment solutions. Yet they are adding Sabi to its business products. The aim is to make it possible for more small businesses to respond to their customers’ preferred methods of payment.
 
 
  
 
 
 Speaking on Sabi, Pesapal CEO Agosta Liko said;
 
 
  
 
 
 
 “We exist to bolster financial and digital inclusion in the markets we are in. We offer businesses freedom to access services that they have traditionally had more difficulty getting. Either due to their size or volumes. With Sabi, we are doing this in the most accessible, affordable and mobile way available anywhere. Sabi is also our way of taking financial services to the informal sector. A segment that has before been underserved”
 
 
 
 Businesses can access Sabi online via www.pesapal.com. Where they set up a business account and sign a merchant contract. They will then proceed to buy their Sabi terminal. Which when delivered, will be set up for them and allows them to start transacting within 24 hours.
 
 
  
 
 
 Pesapal is both PCI PIN and PCI DSS certified. Meaning that international security standards are applied to all card transactions. Ensuring security for both businesses and their customers.
 
 
  
 
 
 Founded in 2010, Pesapal has a presence in 7 countries. These include Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Malawi. Pesapal payments work on the internet and directly on the handset. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The company has Speke Hotel, Imperial group of hotels, Kabira Country Club and more amongst its clients.

"What Africa Needs to be the Next World&#8217;s Super-power
","There is a huge hype that Africa is behind and Africa will never develop up to par. I say they are wrong…or rather, their perspective is wrong! I am indeed a 3rd generation child of the industrial revolution, and I grew up EU forming in the 70ties and Oil crisis in the 80ties and I have been one of the pioneers riding on the B2B dotcom ware since mid 90ties.
 I have done business consulting in Europe for more than 20 years, yet when I come to my beloved Africa (East Africa in particular) I have to realize my knowledge and experience is not fully applicable. For 4 years I have been working, investing, molding, and funding startups in EA, and as much as Africa has my heart, I also realize the perspective has to change.
 Instead of Industrialism, we should talk about Africalism! What I mean by that is Africa doesn’t have 100 year to develop and reap output, like the western world had with the industrial revolution. And the later dot.com revolution put China, South Korea and Japan on the map within 10 years only, yet we were just getting the telco infrastructure in place in Africa.
 But once established – as of today  there is actually more 4G coverage in Africa than in Europe. And cheapest place in the world to have a mobile app computed is…Uganda. FinTech center of the world is…Nairobi. And the whole liberal movement of free micro-trade with mobile money is setting a pace no one can compete with. I think Africa is the next frontier.
 I think the combo of available technology, business opportunity and collaborative scalability plus investors with a mindset for not copying the west but merging the best from all sides. For me THAT’S Africalism!
 It’s not just technology, knowledge, opportunity and money, it is HOW you strategize, implement and scale! Allow me to share what I think are pivotal factors for Africalism:
 
  Job-intensive businesses will win
 Serviceable technology is key
 Co-operating / Sharing is a prerequisite for social scalability
 
 Job-intensive businesses will win! We tend to think that when we industrialize, we let machines do the job…well partially true, that is the ultimate outcome of the revolution. But as the revolution goes on, it is intensive. Look at the labor figures in UK around 1900-1940 set aside the wars. It was intense! Reality in Africa is that the more jobs you create, the more successful you become!
 Creating wealth only will not sustain you in Africa. The best platform to ensure you against political, non-liberal or competitive challenges, is if you have people engagement. And eventually the more jobs you have created, the more wealth you create for all, and at some point, the wealth you create supersede the wealth “taken” by the workers, and you start making substantial overhead.
 However, the catch is to see that the way to big business is WITH people, and not at the COST OF people. The people is the most important asset in your business, yet very few companies in Africa put that focus forward. Good news is that it leaves opportunities for scalable social entrepreneurs like us! Serviceable technology is key. Adapting new technology is tempting, however it has to be serviceable.
 In one of my businesses I do bio- briquetting (replacing charcoal), and the machines we use are purely made in Uganda! In Denmark we have a lot of renewable industry and also very efficient briquetting systems, however they are not serviceable on the ground locally in Gulu or Rakai!
 And consider that hybrid electric cars might be more efficient and cheaper to drive, but when there is no infrastructure and charging systems, it is not applicable. Here I think modern biogas systems will be able to make adaptable technology and you can use organic waste to drive your car.
 Because THAT itself is very applicable in for example Uganda, it holds my vote on Africalism Co-operating / Sharing is a prerequisite for social scalability. Sharing is caring we say. Yet all classic textbooks on how to build a business base upon liberalism where the risk is yours and the money is yours too.
 And from a point of focusing and monitoring your business, it makes sense. But pursuing success this way requires “someone somewhere” coming up with investment capital for scaling, and I strongly believe this is where most viable businesses in Africa fail! Because there is a build in failure in this equation: You cannot scale if don’t scale socially as well!
 The biggest “infrastructure” in Africa is social. The extended family system, the culture of where you actually take care of each other. If you don’t consider that social scalability has to go hand in hand with your business scalability, sooner or later the mouth that has to be fed is more important than the business, and you fail.
 Success will be derived by those who understand how to leverage a cooperative or networking model, where not just money, but risks and decisions are shared. In the early days of the last century, Denmark and Scandinavia derived adaptive models from the industrialized Britain, forming some of biggest and longest lasting cooperatives, even working today (Arla Foods, making for example LurPak, which is available in Uganda as well).
 As a believer of Africalism, I don’t advoke for a copy of the model, however I strongly believe there is a strong correlation between cooperative model and social scalability. It’s the only way the risk will be shared in the impact zone, thus the only way it will be sustainable.

"Yes we have cut some employees, but we are not closing in Uganda- Kilimall Managing Director.
","It seems as the year comes to the end, to be raining downsizing in tech companies in Uganda. With Kilimall being the latest in the game. Yesterday, we reported that Jumia Classifieds Uganda terminated the contracts of all its staff. But, it seems the venture isnt alone. (See also: Jumia Classifieds terminates all staff in Uganda, Shifting Operation to Kenya)
 
  
 
 
 After reading our post on the Jumia Classifieds downsizing, one of our readers wrote to us. He was informing us that theres also massive downsizing taking place at Kilimall.
 
 
  
 
 
 In a conversation with Wang Chengyang  the Managing Director for Uganda and Nigeria  he confirmed the rumors. 
 
 
  
 
 
 We don’t renew the contracts with some old staffs cause they don’t match our requirments [sic] as our business increasing. Maybe they are familar [sic] with some areas, but they are not eager for success, we need the staffs who are self-driven, keeping on learning and improving, Wang wrote in an email.
 
 
  
 
 
 Our reader who tipped us off said: they only have one department left, purchases. But, Wang pointed out that they have only downsized the team by two employees. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Only two we downsized at Kilimall Uganda, the graphic designer &amp; digital marketing specialist, cause we have a central team in  to incharge [sic] of those work for Kilimall Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria, Wang added.
 
 
  
 
 
 Kilimall currently has around 10 employees in Uganda. These are doing order fulfillment, customer service, and local vendor management. Though in total, the venture has over 100 employees in Kenya and around 30 in Nigeria. Kilimall was launched in Uganda at the end of May 2016.
 
 
  
 
 
 One thing, interesting about the downsizing is how Uganda is losing out on employment opportunities. This is due to the improvement in technology that has made outsourcing less costly. 
 
 
  
 
 
 In both scenarios, Jumia Classifieds and Kilimall, the jobs are being taken to Kenya. As companies, their main goal is to cut costs as much as possible. So, if it means moving the jobs away from Uganda, theyll do that.

"OffGridBox, with operations in Rwanda, raises $1.6M in seed funding
","OffGridBox, a provider of affordable renewable energy and clean water, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding. According to TechCrunch, the Doen and Good Energies Foundations led the round. With Banque Populaire du Rwanda as a partner.
 According to the startup, their innovative technology is a solution for more than 2 billion people worldwide that need energy and clean water on a daily basis. OffGridBox  as the name suggests  develops boxes  the size of shades  that provide both electricity and clean water.
 Emiliano Cecchini and Davide Bonsignore founded OffGridBox. They started by selling globally to individuals for off-grid living purposes with additional development projects. However, our founders wanted to create a significant social impact, the startup adds. Thats why they chose Rwanda.
 
 In addition to the success of various pilot projects, Rwanda’s support for green technology and innovation made it ideal for OffGridBox to start the PayAsYouGo model.
 
 Each box costs about $15,000 to build, and an extra $10,000 to deliver and install. The business model has an investor or investors cover the initial cost. Then receive a share of the revenue for the life of the box. At full capacity usage, this might take around two years, after which the revenue split shifts. At around $10,000 of revenue per year per box with full use, the IRR is estimated at 15 per cent.

 OffGridBox is expecting to close a Series A in 2019. Together with the seed funding, the money will support the deployment of a total of 42 box installations in Rwandan communities. Though, the 42 boxes are just the beginning. They also hope to deploy as many as 1,000 throughout Rwanda. But, even then, that would only reach a fifth of the country’s off-grid market.
 Last year, OffGridBox was admitted to the TechStars accelerator as part of the 2018 group. TechStars ventures ended up investing in the startup.
 They have also received grants and financial support from various other organizations. This includes a $300k loan from the DOEN Foundation as well as a grant from Good Energies Foundation. On top of that, they also won $100,000 cash prize from the Mass Challenge after emerging as the 2017 winners.

"Find out how Unreasonable East Africa can support your business
","Recently released research findings on the Uganda Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Initiative  carried out by Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE), Center for Development Alternatives and Enterprise Uganda showed that despite the growth seen in the entrepreneurship space in the country over the past couple of years, a vast majority of Small and Growing Businesses in the country were still grappling with access to effective Business Development Services (BDS).
 These are services or products offered to entrepreneurs at various stages of their business needs, aimed at skills transfer or business advice. Without a nose-dive into the technical and operational aspects of the businesses, its chances of gaining access to the much-needed finances are slim.
 Even worse, without adequate support, any funds raised risk not being appropriated in the right ways if the business lacks a proper understanding of itself.
 At Unreasonable East Africa, we understand that support to businesses goes far beyond giving them access to funds. Through our partnership support that spans 5 years, beginning with a 10 months program, we work closely with early-stage businesses to understand their challenges and growth ambitions. We then tap into our network of over 150 experts and investors to provide them with the resources to effectively address these challenges and set them up to grow in the right direction.
 As a member of the UEA Alumni, you will remain plugged into our large network
 from across the world and build lifelong business and personal relationships!
 We are also excited to announce that in 2019, we will be rolling out an internal capital facility. Companies in our portfolio that are investment ready will be able to access up to $250,000 of capital. We shall, however, continue to facilitate additional capital through our extensive investor network.

"Can Traffica App Solve Kampala&#8217;s Traffic Woes?
","Traffica is an app that enables road users to share real-time traffic updates so as to get around Kampala easily.
 Of course, Traffica App borne out of the need to tame the annoying Kampala traffic jam that easily turns a well planned-out day into a disaster.
 The app was developed by GreatMinds, a team of Ugandan youths looking to build tech solutions addressing the various challenges in Uganda.
 The team, of 6 individuals, has two girls and believe the fact all individuals have different talents is one of the assets thatll see them bring their products to market and further.
 Though they have been working together for slightly over a year, this is their first product which they released on Google Play on 8 September 2017.
 Given that traffic Jam in Kampala is a pressing challenge, the team decided, therefore, to develop Traffica app so that road users can share and know in real-time traffic updates so they can travel more conveniently.
 The team argues that by one knowing the traffic situation on a certain road, it is easy to make informed travel decisions which result in better transport use.
 The app also offers tips on road safety and car care &amp; maintenance so road users are sensitized. So far, it comes in two languages; luganda and English though they hope to add more local languages.
 It is currently, available on Google Play. You can dowload it here.

"Tourism &#038; Travel: More African Startups Needed
","Over the years, global tourism has experienced steady and tremendous growth to become one of the world’s largest industries. According to Statista, tourism forms a multi-trillion-dollar industry worldwide with direct, indirect and induced economic contribution of over 7.6 trillion U.S. Dollars in 2016. The World Bank estimated a total of 1.2 billion international tourist arrivals worldwide in 2016. In their Airline Industry Forecast 2013-2017, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the total number of airline passengers worldwide to rise to 3.91 billion in 2017, a 31% increase since 2012.
 
 Africa, despite having a wealth of historic monuments and archeological sites, accounts for only 3.8% of the global tourism revenue and just 5.8% of the world’s incoming tourists (AfDB 2015). Being a continent with exceptional wildlife (gorillas and many other primate species); magnificent landscapes, picturesque coastlines and mountains; and amazing attractions such as the Victoria Falls, Robben Island and the Pyramids; Africa’s tourism sector still has vast untapped potential that can be exploited to jump-start rapid economic growth.
 The Pyramid of King Cheops in North Africa was built in 2650 BC with 2.5 million limestone blocks
 Therefore, there is need for more aggressive innovation and investment by African startups in the tourism &amp; hospitality segment in order to draw in bigger numbers of tourists from across the world. For African countries that lack a manufacturing base or those that are over-reliant on their agricultural exports, international tourism is among the best ways of increasing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and reducing dependency on foreign aid.
 Consistent innovation and thought leadership should be emphasized even more in the service industries where tourism has a direct economic impact. These industries include hospitality services such as accommodation, resorts and hotels; transportation services such as cruise ships, airlines, and taxicabs; entertainment venues such as theatres, music venues and amusement parks; and attractions such as national parks and game reserves.
 Like in many industries, the internet and technology are trending tools in the tourism &amp; travel industry due to the growing and huge market. Internet or Tech startups in Africa startups have an opportunity to venture into different areas in the industry such as online/mobile air ticket and hotel bookings. It is also worth noting that tourists are heavily reliant on the internet when searching for information about destinations, travel tips and reviews before making their final travel decisions.
 It is safe to say that tourism makes the world go round. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) noted that tourism is the source of one in every eleven jobs created, and that tourism makes up over 10% of the global GDP. Without Tourism, a very large deficit in African economies would arise.

"5 Ways to take in Negative Feedback and Rejection in the Startup World
","They say for one to be successful, they should be willing to move from failure to failure and setback to setback without losing momentum.
 Some, if not most of us, have received negative feedback, criticism or rejection before. Yet having the ability to accept it positively requires a certain amount of self-awareness as it can be tough to deal with sometimes.
 If you can learn to handle rejection, criticism or negative feedback and turn it to your advantage, it can really help you grow your startup. Below are 5 steps on how to effectively handle negative feedback. Pick out those you think can work for you.
 1. Avoid being reactionary
 Ideally, when someone rejects or criticizes your work, theres a message they are sending you. Instead of focusing on the rejection or criticism, pause and listen to what that person is saying. It’s natural to want to defend yourself immediately especially when feeling riled up. But pause for a couple of seconds and take in what the client is saying.
 It’s natural to want to defend yourself immediately especially when feeling riled up. But pause for a couple of seconds and take in what theyre trying to communicate.
 2. Put yourself in the persons shoes
 Try as much as possible to understand things from the other partys perspective. Just because you have spent hundreds of hours working on your product doesnt mean people will like it.
 Therefore, instead of sulking because someone doesnt like your product or pitch, simply imagine yourself in that persons position. If it were a client, would you spend on your product? If it were an investor, would you invest in what youre trying to get others to invest in?
 In the end, this will help you avoid thinking that these people dont like you or just want you to fail. It will also help you become better, which feedback, rejection, and criticism are meant for.
 3. Admit and ask for time
 In cases where a client or investor rejects you or your product on the basis of something that can be worked on, it is safe to admit it. But, it is also better that you request them to give you a little time and you get back to the drawing board.
 This will help defuse the emotions and the whole situation immediately which give you time to put the criticism in perspective. If theyre understanding and it is not an urgent need on their end, theyll surely give you time.
 But do also note that it is not a guarantee. For example, a prospect may be looking for a quick solution. So, it is also advisable that you assess the situation and understand how likely this is to work out.

 4. Analyze the feedback.
 Feedback is only as good as the person giving it as well as how relevant it is to what youre working on. Whenever you get feedback, analyze it by asking yourself a few questions.
 These include; Is it something you should look into? Are there facts backing this feedback? Get the opinion of your colleagues or a friend as it will enable you to stay objective.
 You can also go an extra mile and ask the person giving you the feedback for anything else he/she thinks you should work on. This will give you more information to enable you to improve.
 5. Don’t over apologize, dont take it personal
 It is human to err. And, naturally, when you do that, people who wish you well will always step in. Criticism and negative feedback are part of life. If necessary, apologize once, maturely and sincerely.
 Be concise in your apology, do not go overboard. An apology shows that you’ve acknowledged the problem and will solve it.
 Secondly, dont think that because someone has criticized, they dont like you or your products. Unless otherwise, most people give criticism to help you get better. Therefore, dont take it personally.
 It is advisable to take negative feedback as a learning opportunity. People who give you negative feedback, after all, is said want to see your startup improve and grow to serve them better.
 Feedback enables learning from different perspectives as it gives you different points of view from the different clients. So, learn from the mistakes and move on to grow.

"Yoza App, &#8220;Uganda&#8217;s Uber-like app for dirty laundry&#8221; is bouncing back
","Yoza App, described by CNN as Ugandas Uber-like app for dirty laundry is making a come back. I got this information after speaking to Solomon Kitumba, a co-founder. This is happening after almost a year of inactivity product-wise and more activity in-fighting-wise.
 In April last year, we wrote an article titled does YozaPay mean end of YozaApp?. This was after we found out that some of the founders of Yoza App had broken away to start Yoza Pay.
 And, indeed, going by the latest revelations by Nicholas Kamanzi, Yoza Pay was the end of Yoza App. Until early March this year. At the time we wrote the article, the founders were having internal conflicts.
 According to Nicholas, he told the team that we might have to pivot from laundry and either focus on enabling as many businesses seamlessly accept payments. But the pivot idea wasn’t received well.
 Some team members broke off and launched Yoza Pay minus Solomon. They engaged companies like Jumia and Valhalla, a nightclub who ended up as some of their first clients.
 The group chose the name Yoza Pay because, as Nicholas wrote, our brand name had created a lot of trust in the community and I thought if we rode on this name, we would create a suite of products that different people would use because they liked Yoza. Though it was later changed to SulaPay. Perhaps due to internal conflicts and disagreements.
 Solomon says that Yoza App 2.0 will only have two people from the previous Yoza App 1.0. And looking at the current Yoza App Crunchbase profile, there are only two people. Solomon Kitumba as the CEO and Isaac Kyuka as the CTO.
 It is not clear how they will fund the company as well as the balance between activities. Seeing that both pursued different engagements after the initial disagreements. Solomon founded Swipe2Pay and Isaac Kyuka is part of SulaPay.
 Also read: Useremit to focus on solving the intra-Africa money transfer problem
 Though Solomon has been engaging several investors to secure funding for Yoza App. Some of them include Einstein Rising that invests in ideas and companies with a social impact.
 One clear challenge the two will face is lack of focus due to divided attention. Revamping one startup as well as starting another is a tough job. Another is what Nicholas pointed out; the technology divide between our customers and washers.
 Launched in August 2015, Yoza App quickly became everyones darling. Especially after winning the very first MTN App challenge as well as getting featured in CNN and BBC.
 Yet after two and a half years, what we got was a scanty account of events from Nicholas Kamanzi through a series of medium posts here, here and here. Solomon disagreed with some and promised to contribute my side of the story.
 While as Yoza App is facing in-fightings, another laundry startup, Kisafi, started over a half a year later, in April 2016, is flouring. At one point, in 2016, Kisafi attempted to enter the Kampala market through Yoza App. Yet, according to Solomon, the conversation fell through.
 Kisafi has now become a brand name in Kenya to the extent that when I was in Nairobi some described Yoza App as works like Kisafi. The startup has grown to cover almost the entire Nairobi. Plus, a rumour was made that they secured angel investment a few months after their launch.

"Startup of the Week: Poketi.net &#8211; send and receive money across borders and networks
","Poketi is a Ugandan cross network payment startup founded in 2014 by Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship program fellow, Ivan Mugere.
 According to Poketi, mobile money is available in 93 countries with 271 services. Yet it is impossible to move money between Telecom Network wallets. Where such a functionality exists, its expensive. Poketi is able to facilitate transfer of money between partner wallets  M-Pesa, MTN, Airtel, Paka Cash among others.
 Poketi allows its users buy airtime for any registered phone number on any network using a mobile money account of any given network as well as make bill payments. It also allows them to send Money to any registered phone number using a mobile money account of any given network. Further more, it allows you to withdraw your mobile money from any mobile money agent, even the ones with float on other networks. It also allows you to receive money from abroad instantly on mobile money. Lastly, SACCOS/Investment Clubs can do financial transactions on the app with their members; deposits, withdraws, savings, bulk payments.
 Infosis is the parent company for Poketi. The startup has managed to raise funding locally from a series of shareholders in cash as well as in kind. Some of the funding came from Ivan Mugeere (with an injection of $100,000), James Bwire (with an estimated injection of $120,000) and Pascal Ojijo (with an estimated injection of $250,000). We also understand that one of the shareholders provided a building where the startup currently operates from in Ntinda  though they declined to reveal further details.
 One of the key successes for the startup is that it grossed revenue of $250,000 in 2016 and is looking at a medium target of hitting at least $100,000 in daily net profit by 2022. They are also targeting at least 1000 monthly app downloads by close of December 2017 as well as at least 1500 transactions a day by July 2017. We were unable to establish the current status of the app downloads as well as daily transactions.
 The team is currently made up of Ivan Mugeere (CEO, Founder), Stefan Trifunovic (International Business Development Manager), Jeremiah Mwanja (Business Development Manager), Keneth Attria (Software engineer), Joseph Tabajjiwa (Senior software engineer), Brian Odwongo (Accountant) Johnathan Kinyi (Sales person), Madina Kitimbo (Sales Person) and Kyle Duncan (Public Relations Manager).
 The startup has been able to bag a couple of partnerships with local telecom giants MTN and Airtel as well as the Tony Elumelu owned multinational United Bank of Africa (UBA)  which Ivan Mugere considers the most powerful they have so far. The UBA partnership is mainly to be used for remittances. One of the reasons Poketi secured the UBA partnership could be because Ivan Mugere is a Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program fellow.
 Poketi is currently seeking $1,000,000 in funding for which the return on investments are up to 30% per year for debt financing. For private equity, they offer 20% of the company’s Premium/permanent shares.
 Some of the challenges Poketi is facing are include competition from commercial banks such as Stanbic, Ecobank, UBA, insurance companies such as NIKO, UAP, TransAfrica as well as telecom Companys mobile wallets, such as MTN, Airtel, Safaricom etc as well as forex Bureau Exchange and Microfinance Institutions.
 The other challenge is the fact that Poketi has to pre-buy everything that customers have to use. This, Ivan says, means they have to have a big cash bank to facilitate operations. Lastly, Ivan says that investors in Africa always ask more for less which demotivates the founders.

"The biggest challenge every app startup in Africa has, but doesn’t know
","The Silicon Valley inspired mobile app eco-system has become a huge industry with over two million apps in the Google Play and iPhone App Stores generating billions of dollars of direct and indirect revenue.
 This is all well and good in developed market economies where the average smartphone user has a decent spec device with plenty of storage, access to virtually unlimited broadband data and high discretionary income.
 Also read: Goodwell Investments announces new $23M fund for sub-Saharan Africa
 People in these markets install apps on a whim. Most have several to many apps installed on their phones they rarely use or have even forgotten about.
 Not so in developing and emerging markets
 At biNu in South Africa we learned the hard way that despite offering awesome #datafree apps which were free of mobile data cost to use, the number of downloads and installs was much less than expected.
 This was somewhat baffling given our core understanding that Data Affordability is Key to Online Engagement in Emerging Markets and certainly is the case in South Africa where mobile data costs are comparatively high, as highlighted by a populist #DataMust Fall consumer campaign.
 We gradually realized in a region like Africa there was what we came to term an “app install problem”.
 Analysing our own data supported by anecdotal feedback led us to develop the hypothesis this was due to:
 
 limited storage capacity on the lower cost devices most people were using;
 the data cost to download apps (plus updates);
 user concern that apps consume previous data in background mode and “eat your airtime”;
 the perceived value of an installing app compared with the easy utility of Google Search and web browsing.
 
 Quantifying the app install problem
 To test our hypothesis last April / May we conducted a survey with person-to-person interviews in two Cape Town township communities and a digital survey with mobile consumers in the Gauteng region.
 The survey results confirmed our hypothesis with some, particularly startling results. The full report can be downloaded from this link: Mobile Consumer Research Project 2018 (PDF file).
 Highlights include:
 
 84% of people have phones with 16 GB of storage capacity or less;
 70% of people buy airtime data in amounts of R50 ($3.40) or less and 62% of people buy data top-ups at least weekly, or more often;
 most people have irregular or no access to Wi-Fi.;
 82% of people regularly run out of data;
 81% of people interviewed face-to-face had 5 or fewer apps they had installed on their phones;
 100% of people interviewed had WhatsApp installed, 96% had SHAREit and 67% had Facebook Lite;
 the factors people consider most before installing an app are:- available phone storage (34%), data cost to download (29%), how long they might want to use it for (21%), how much data an app will use (14%);
 90% of people regularly get apps through file sharing with friends (using SHAREit) instead of using data to download from the app store;
 64% of people said messaging was the activity they missed the most when they were without data — the next closest was 19% who said they missed ‘social media’.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 
 1. When you are deciding to install an app that you would like, what is the most important thing you think about?
 
 &nbsp;
 2. Do you ever run out of data on your phone?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. When you have no data on your phone, what do you miss doing the most?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Conclusions
 Outside of a less than a handful of popular apps, the average smartphone user in South Africa is extremely unlikely to install an app, and if they do the value proposition needs to be strong and sustained.
 WhatsApp is easily the top dog of apps and is installed (and no doubt regularly used) on pretty much every one of the 25 million smartphone devices in the South African market.
 With South Africa as the largest and highest GDP per capita economy in Africa, it would be reasonable to assume the app install problem is even more pronounced across the rest of the region.

"Airbnb hosts in Tanzania must register or face arrest
","On Monday this week, Tanzanian authorities told short-stay accommodation operators to register their facilities with the government within the next 50 days or face arrest according to Reuters. This move, definitely, affects hosts on Airbnb.
 “There are many individuals who are operating these facilities, said Rosada Musoma, assistant director of licensing and control in the ministry of tourism. Adding that they want them to be recognized officially by the government and pay required license fees.”
 When the 50-day period expires at the end of next month, the government will go from “house to house” and arrest any operators who have failed to register, Reuters wrote.
 As one of the pioneers of the sharing economy, Airbnb  like Uber  has met a lot of resistance from the authorities. Yet, it has always pushed back in some countries. That is not likely to be the case for Tanzania. Partly because the market is still small thus insignificant.
 Yet, some African countries will likely jump at the opportunity to tax the industry. The way they did after the Ugandan government started taxing social media. In the end, this will come back to bite Airbnb as their service gets adopted widely across the continent.

 In the period between September 2016 and September 2017, there were 100,000 hosts on Airbnb spread across the African continent. These welcomed a total of 1.2 million guests according to the report released last year by Airbnb.
 Airbnb also pointed out that it has had hosts in the East African country from as far as 2011 and as of September 2017, there were 2,300 active listings by hosts in Tanzania on Airbnb. This made it Airbnbs fifth African country in total guest arrivals. Each of these made an annual average of $1,000 in revenue which was lower than $1,500, the average for the continent.

"Kenya&#8217;s online marketplace AfricaSokoni raises $445k from an angel investor
","AfricaSokoni, an online marketplace based in Nairobi, recently closed an additional US $445,000 in funding as part of its Seed round. The funding round which closed on March 10, 2019, is follow on investment from an already existing angel investor in the business. Ebrima Fatty, CEO and Co-founder of AfricaSokoni, declined to disclose who the angel investor is.
 “We raised the funding through a European angel investor, who would like to maintain his identity private, at least for now, for a very good reason,” Fatty wrote in an email to Digest Africa.
 In October 2017, the startup raised $300,000 from an undisclosed angel investor which it followed up with $250,000 from the same angel investor in June 2018. This funding, therefore, takes AfricaSokoni’s total funding raised to date to almost a million dollars. “The total funding now stands at $995K from inception,” Fatty noted.
 The company is looking to use the funding to “consolidate their gains” so far as well as expand their current product offerings on the platform.
 “We are also building an important component of our Business model which we could not build from the beginning because of funding and strategic issue,” Fatty pointed out. To date, AfricaSokoni maintains a team of 30 employees who are all based in Nairobi.
 Founded in 2017 but officially launched in 2018 AfricaSokoni is one of the many startups across the continent that are looking to take advantage of the still expected  but yet to arrive  growth and boom in e-commerce across Africa.
 In 2018, according to the Digest Africa Index, e-commerce with 25 funding rounds lagged financial services (71 rounds) as well as transport and logistics (29 rounds) by the number of funding rounds recorded. This makes sense considering financials services (payments, credit), as well as transport and logistics, are the rails on which E-commerce grows. Of the 25 funding rounds recorded, 19 were at Seed/Series A stage representing a still nascent e-commerce market.
 Also read: African Startups That Have Raised At Least $20M In A Single VC Round
 While there have been some early players in the e-commerce sector including Jumia/Zando, Takealot and Konga, other than these, there are yet to be any other significant players in the e-commerce space across the continent. Though there’s a new breed of emerging players, who are vertically focused including Copia Global, Twiga Foods, Kasha, Sky.Garden and La Reina who all raised funding in 2018.
 E-commerce has recorded several high profile failures in the past decade after seeing record figures in investment mostly due to Jumia, Takealot and Konga  whose investors have all since found an exit. Jumia listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Takealot was acquired by long-time investor Naspers while Konga was acquired by Zinox and merged it with its offline subsidiary Yudala.
 The ventures that have not survived the e-commerce boom include Egypt’s Nefsak which had raised to the tune of EGP 10 million ( ~ US $0.5 million), as well as a cohort of Naspers-backed ventures  comprehensive e-commerce platform Kalahari (which was absorbed by Takealot in South Africa), high-end furniture platform 5Rooms, online fashion outlet Style 36, digital camera store SAcamera and baby product outfit Kinderelo.
 This year, Nigeria’s DealDey became the latest e-commerce venture to close shop. The platform was established in 2011 by Konga co-founder and former CEO, Sim Shagaya. In 2015, at its peak, the startup raised $5 million from Swedish investors Kinnevik. On the other hand, Gloo.ng decided to pivot from e-commerce all-together to instead focus on e-procurement.
 The struggle of e-commerce ventures across Africa amid underdeveloped payment solutions, trade and logistics infrastructure and a cash culture with low albeit improving per capita incomes makes survival even harder for startups in the industry without funding to survive years of cash burning as they wait for the e-commerce market to mature. This struggle is further reflected in the fact that those that are currently looked at as notable e-commerce ventures across Africa have raised not less than $100 million each in total funding.
 Besides, payments and transport and logistics companies that were previously B2B are looking to pivot and build e-commerce market places in a B2B2C model to reach Africa’s mass market. These include Safaricom (Masoko), MTN (open APIs), Flutterwave (GetBarter), Cellulant (Mula) and DHL (eShop Africa). We would also expect global e-commerce players to look to enter the market through partnerships with existing payments and transport and logistics players as was the case with Safaricom tie-up with AliExpress.
 To continue to build their venture and to survive through their losses, AfricaSokoni and any other early-stage e-commerce ventures will need to raise more funding  lots and lots of it. According to Fatty, the startup is looking to close another round which will still form part of their current round. “We are trying to close our current extended seed round,” he said.
 However, they won’t stop there. AfricaSokoni also has their eyes on securing a follow-on, though at the “appropriate time”. Fatty noted: “We will certainly fundraise again, but the timing depends on the outcome of the current round. We will do a “series A” round when we decide to expand; as you know AfricaSokoni is an African brand, and we have our eyes on the entire continent. The amount and timing of that round will be decided at the appropriate time.”
 Update: An earlier version of this article stated that Nefsak had raised US $10 million instead of EGP 10 million. We have since updated that.

 With debt, founders do not have to worry about losing their share structure holding. It’s all intact. Yet, with equity, you usually have to give out a large chunk of your shareholding.
 
 
  
 
 
 This could be VCs or Angel Investors. These argue that they need more skin in the game for the money they are giving, otherwise, why are they investing? 
 
 
  
 
 
 With debt, all the investor wants is his principal and if at all his interest. If you pay back his principal in good time, he will almost reinvest, even before the interest has gets paid back. This, in turn, improves your business credit score.
 
 
 2. Debt can almost always be restructured whenever it comes due
 
 
 About loan repayment deadlines, these terrify a lot of people. Yet I have come to learn over time that you can restructure debt can.
 
 
  
 
 
 Let’s say you’ve borrowed from an Investor USD 2000. You needed it to increase marketing, or produce more, or improve the design. Because nothing is ever constant with business, you hit a snag or fall behind on schedule. 
 
 
  
 
 
 This affects your repayment power, since, let’s face it, you won’t have the money to pay back what you borrowed. If you realize that you can’t pay back in time, it is important to notify your investor. Do this early enough. 
 
 
  
 
 
 You can either request an extension or restructure the loan to meet both your needs. Defaulting on debt is not new. It’s how you deal with it that counts.
 
 
 3. You can opt for convertible notes
 
 
 This is one of the ingenious ways startups can benefit from investor funding. Especially for small amounts of money.
 
 
  
 
 
 A convertible note is money given to you that converts into equity. It can be in form of two instruments; convertible debt or convertible equity. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Angel investors and startups opt for this when they are uncertain of the true valuation of a startup. Yet want to defer that discussion, especially if it is an idea. (See also: KENNETH LEGESI explains how to Rightly Establish the Valuation of Your Ugandan Startup)
 
 
  
 
 
 With both convertible debt and convertible equity, the investment translates to equity later. Say when the company is fundraising for series A round. 
 
 
  
 
 
 But, theres a difference between the two. In the latter, the investor may get entitled to preferred shares on conversion of the investment. What you need to know about convertible notes is that in the short term they are one of the best options for startups. Because they are less costly than equity round financing. 
 
 
  
 
 
 But, take note of these terminologies when signing and committing to your term sheet; discount rate, valuation cap, interest rate and maturity rate (for convertible debt) and performance milestones.
 
 
 4. Interest payments on debt are tax-deductible
 
 
 When you’re filing income tax returns, you will be able to claim for a tax deduction. This is based on the amount of debt your business took out and used in operations.
 
 
  
 
 
 The tax deductions are computed on the interest rate attached to that debt and determined by the tax rate. So say, for example, you took a debt worth $50,000. Corporate income tax in Uganda stands at 30% at the moment. Let’s say the debt was borrowed at an interest of 12%.
 
 
 
 
 Tax Deductible Interest = Debt x Interest rate
 = 50,000 x 12%
 =$6,000
 Interest tax shield = deduction x tax rate
 =6000 x 30%
 = $1,800 (what you save when filing your returns.
 
 
 
 
 Thus you pay income taxes less interest tax shield. This also lowers the actual cost of the loan to the company.
 
 
 5. You get to keep your profits
 
 
 If structured and forecast well within a business’s operation, you will find that taking a loan is actually not a bad.
 
 
  
 
 
 Once you have paid back the loan plus interest, you can get to keep all future profits. This can’t happen when you give away equity, as you will have to share all subsequent profits with your partners. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Of course, this needs careful planning. To ensure you do meet your loan obligations to the investor, and maintain an amicable business relationship.

"GetPoints launches loyalty program platform for restaurants and retailers
","GetPoints launched their loyalty program platform for restaurants and retailers across East Africa. “We just finished the initial soft launch in Nairobi [four weeks ago],” Scott Holley, the founder, and MD wrote in an email.
 Scott founded GetPoints early this year, though only launched officially in August. “Through my prior position as CEO of an online restaurant delivery company in Nairobi, I met many restaurant owners,” Scott wrote.
 He says that he “heard first hand how there was a need for an online [and] mobile app loyalty program platform to serve all the independent restaurants and retail businesses in East Africa.”
 According to Scott, they “currently have 65 well-known and popular restaurants on board. They also have other retail businesses on the platform. Adding that “we now have over 2,800 loyalty members who have downloaded our app”. But also adding at least 100 new members every day.
 Though the soft launch was done in Nairobi, GetPoints started from Kampala.
 “We started in Kampala in August [2018] with 30 different businesses and in September with 35 businesses in Nairobi,” he said. But, they are also looking at launching in several other African countries. “We are also launching in South Africa at the end of the year.”
 Beyond targeting regular visitors at restaurants, GetPoints is also looking at sports clubs, spas, and salons. “We will have more of these types of loyalty members in the coming months,” Scott said.
 The startup operates a subscription fee business model. “We offer businesses a 30-day free trial and then there is a small monthly fee based on their number of loyalty members,” Scott said. Monthly plans start at $25 a month for a business location.
 SPONSORED: Find out how Unreasonable East Africa can support your business
 While the users are rewarded based on the number of times they visit or buy from a given business. Depending on the frequency, they can get a discount or free item on their next purchase.
 Scott says that GetPoints is giving business owners and managers a better way to engage with their customers as well as market their businesses.
 “Advertising and marketing through TV, radio, print, and SMS are expensive and often ineffective,” he pointed out. Adding that the “GetPoints loyalty program provides business owners and managers with an online automated and seamless marketing program plus an easy to use customer database dashboard.”
 “Now customers can get rid of paper and plastic loyalty cards and just use one mobile loyalty app.”
 This makes sense to me. Because I got to know of GetPoints close to two months ago. That was after visiting Bistro, a restaurant in Kisementi, Kampala, and finding flyers advertising their services. At that time, I was in search for loyalty program startups in Uganda that were helping, especially restaurants and hotels to know more about their customers.
 Before that, I had to carry several cards depending on which hotel, restaurant or supermarket I buy from. Having everything centralized makes it easy for one to track their points without having to do any math.
 GetPoints hasn’t raised a single coin from external investors, though they are likely to consider the option in the future. “We are self-funded and will be profitable by the end of 2018,” Scott said.

"The Naked Truth Up Accelerate Programme Alumni Need to Know
","Yesterday, The UNFPA and Outbox hosted the closure event for the second cycle of the Up Accelerate programme where DigiHealth emerged the winner. Their solution aims at addressing the poor data collection in the health field.
 I agree with the judges decision since the team looked and sounded more polished compared to the rest.
 Up Accelerate, is aimed at supporting young Ugandan entrepreneurs building solutions to sexual and reproductive health issues. It provides seed funding, business training, mentorship and technical guidance to help them advance their ideas and innovations to the next stage.
 Phyllis Kyomuhendo, a team member of Mobile Scan Solutions (mscan), explains: “Up Accelerate has enabled us to improve our product development and financial management processes.”
 Similarly, Noella Aryanyijuka, working on EcoSmart Pads, added: “We have transformed tremendously not only as a startup but as a team. We have learned how to run a company, manage finances, how to network and improve our product development process. We are much closer to launching than we were early this year.”
 While as the teams have made tremendous progress in terms of design thinking, documenting and working as a team, feedback from both the judges and panelists as well as their presentations indicate that theyre still far from bringing a product to mass market.
 Yet, none seems to know that. They dont know that what Up Accelerate has helped them with is a fraction of what lies ahead of them  but thats if at all they are interested in bringing a product to market.
 Phillipa Makobore from Uganda Industrial Research Institute was one of the people that also made this clear to them all throughout her panel discussion. She let them know the fact that health innovations take time.
 In fact, Micheal Niyitegeka  one of the mentors for the cycle participants as well as the moderator of the session that was themed The future of Health Innovations, warned Solomon Kahuuma from Drug Dash of the long journey that awaits him.
 Related: Here’s What Up Accelerate Startups Learned and the Challenges they Faced
 
 Health innovations, according to Phillipa Makobore, have to undergo a lot of approvals from authorities before they can hit the market. They also have to undergo a lot of research and pass several tests to.
 Micheal Niyitegeka also added that, contrary to what most people think, innovation is not the quickest way to get money.
 It also gets worse when it comes to grant money because you have to play to the interest of the person giving you the money, Micheal Niyitegeka on the complexities surrounding Innovation in Uganda.
 Dr. John Mark Bwanika, from The Medical Concierge Group, also added to what Micheal said and emphasized that contrary to what people think, grant money is the most expensive form of capital.
 This served as a warning to those who are solely focused on applying for whatever grant comes around.
 Yet, it seems to be the only form of capital or funding most innovators  especially in the health field can access. It is still very hard and complicated to convince someone to invest in a product that will take years and years to come to the market  which is what health innovations are.
 This prompted Micheal Niyitegaka to add that for one to become an entrepreneur in an environment like Uganda, they have got to be all hands on deck.
 Otherwise, theyll end up suffering what most have suffered  quitting even when they have really good solutions, Micheal Niyitegeka prophesying what might happen to some of the Innovators.
 During the panel discussion, a topic of how to innovate in sexual and reproductive health and make money was also briefly discussed.
 Phillipa Makobore suggested that innovators should focus on understanding their customer, monetizing any low hanging fruits as well as Intellectual Property that can be sold or leased to already existing bigger players in the medical equipment and services field.
 The part of low hanging fruits seemed more feasible and clearer as Noella Aryanyijuka highlighted that as they visited Nyakivare to carry out research for Ecosmart pads, she discovered that many of the ladies needed awareness on sanitation.
 Which presents an opportunity to work with the concerned players to carry out the sensitization campaigns  providing a quick revenue channel as you work to bring the ultimate products to the market.
 Yet, when it comes to Intellectual property  in a separate conversation with Micheal Niyitegeka, he says it is not as easy as it sounds. He attributes the difficulty to the long painful process it takes and the amount of money one should prepare.
 Before adding that what we may call innovation here is not really innovation because it has been done elsewhere and cannot pass for Intellectual Property.
 Although the event was aimed at providing the young entrepreneurs with the opportunity to raise follow-on funding and explore new partnerships to enable their products to access the market, answers to questions from the judges suggested they were far from being investment ready.
 One particular scenario was when Julius Ssebaketta from the iDrain team admitted to not having carried out research on the shelf life of the competitors products.
 Similarly, other teams did not have a comprehensive understanding of how their solution can move beyond a concept and turn into a real business. Their numbers were not well thought out from a business point of view.
 In a separate conversation, Dr. William Lubega admitted that the teams are still a long way from hitting the market. Adding that the teams still need a lot of mentorship and research to ensure their products are competitive on the market.
 But, the blame cannot be relayed on the up accelerate program or the participants. In fact, the Up Accelerate organizing partners have done a good job to polish up the teams thus far.
 Because from our interactions with the teams prior to the demo day, many admitted this to be their first time to experience professional mentoring, proper documentation training as well as speaking to professionals in their field.
 This is a problem that stems from an education system that churns out people who are not curious and ready to solve 21st-century problems with the necessary thinking.
 Secondly, the program is only four months  a period in which it is not easy to pick someone too green and transform them completely.
 In fact, in our conversation with members of the four teams  they all agreed that four months was a very short period of time.
 In conclusion, while as the Up Accelerate program would like to churn out entrepreneurs who are investor ready  it is a long shot. The program should focus on getting the teams in the right innovation mindset and design thinking. They can then come up with a follow-on program to help them with prototyping.
 Additionally, they should focus on partnerships with other accelerator programs or already established companies in the medical equipment field to take on these innovators as it is still a long shot to expect them to move on their own after the programme especially that their innovations are in the health field.

"The Space Hub Relocating from Bukoto Street to a Warehouse along Lugogo By-Pass
","The Space Hub, home to some of Ugandas tech startups has decided to relocate from Bukoto Street to Lugogo bypass. This was revealed to us by Joshua Mugisha, one of the owners of the hub and a director at Qwicart  an online groceries store.
  According to Joshua, they are in the process of fixing and fitting their new location, which is a warehouse off Lugogo bypass.
 The overall vision is an evolution from the previously shared workspace concept to an incubator cutting across various industrials and not just tech as previously was the case, Joshua commenting on the relocation.
 
 The Space Hub was launched in early 2016 as a co-working space for businesses within the digital space. Since inception, it has served as home to several businesses.
 These include Pearl Guide, Eatout, TNS and Qwicart as well as One Africa Medias BrighterMonday and Cheki in Uganda.
 When asked about the source of funding for the hub. Joshua informed us that theyre currently a self-funded initiative.
 But with the change in direction we are taking with the relocation and refocusing of our objective, we shall be looking for strategic partnerships in ensuring we realize successful stories from within, Joshua added.
 However, there are no hubs or incubators in Africa that are self-sustaining. In fact, most of them are heavily subsidized to stay afloat. Yet, this wont deter Joshua and his team.
 It should be noted that this is a very young concept in Uganda hence the expectation of self-sustainability is very early. Success stories aren’t born overnight but take time and diligence, Joshua said.
 With the relocation, Joshua projects that they will contribute more to the ecosystem. Measured by how many businesses can achieve scale and launch out of their incubation Hub.

 As mentioned, we are shifting from being a shared workspace to a business incubator. However, we’ll be handpicking who gets into. We intend to work with these businesses to achieve a sustainable level of success, Joshua added.

"The Daily Brief: Jumpin and Zola electric raise $137,000 and $20,000,000 respectively
","Welcome to todays brief. Theres activity from Zola Electric, Facebook, Jumpin and Kenyas Commercial Bank of Africa. I am going to be as brief as possible. Lets dig in already.
 
 SAs Jumpin raised $137,000
 
 What happened: South African ride-sharing startup Jumpin Rides raised US$137,000 from local and international angel investors to launch apps, expand its customer base and begin expansion into other African markets.
 Why is it important: The ride-hailing market around the world is eventually going to be consolidated. And, in the end, youll have two winners in form of Uber and Lyft wholl have an interest in almost  if not all  significant ride-hailing startups across the world. Perhaps, Jumpin is positioning itself for something like that. Who knows what might happen? Uber Eats acquired orderTalk

 What happened: Commercial Bank of Africa has added new features to its financial services app Loop including increasing the amount of money it will be lending. Customers will be able to access loans of up to $30,000 that will be payable in 3 years.
 Why is it important: Fintech in Africa means lending. Now, I may be wrong, but the lending space seems to be getting crowded with so many options available. How do you separate yourself from the crowd? Take a higher risk. Additionally, dont be surprised when CBA is among the first banks in Africa to go all digital. They partnered with Safaricom and MTN (Rwanda and Uganda) to launch microlending products M-Shwari and MoKash respectively.

 3. Zola Electric raises $20 Million
 What happened: Zola Electric, formerly Off Grid Electric, raised $20 Million in debt from SunFunder and a family fund that wasnt disclosed.
 Why is it important: There is a lot of funding that comes to Africa. However, most of it is impact tagged. Given all energy companies have a social impact element by default  they target the bottom of the pyramid  they have increasingly had it easier to tap into this type of funding.

 4. Expat founders find it easier to raise funding in Africa
 What happened: Olivia Zank, the co-founder of Rwandan factoring firm BeneFactors, told Ventureburn that expact founders find it easier to raise funding than their African counterparts.
 Why is it important: Actually, the right word should be white founders, not expat founders. Additionally, this is not something being realized now. White founders and the people who fund them have known it all along. However, it is important that they are speaking about it. Though, it would even be better if they go beyond just words and put that into action.

 5. Facebook is secretly fighting Ugandas social media tax
 What happened: Kojo Boakye from Facebook is in Kampala engaging government officials and other stakeholders affected by the social media tax that came into effect just a month ago. He also spoke at an event yesterday.
 Why is it important: Facebook is trying to avoid the fire from spreading seeing that many African countries could be adopting a wait and see approach towards the same. Take an example of Egypt.

"These are our best 19 stories of the African tech ecosystem in 2018
","Last year was arguably the best year the African tech ecosystem has ever had. From the launching of new funds, record acquisitions to underserved regions picking up. We have decided to pick out the best 19 stories that we believe shaped the landscape last year and are worth recapping. We shall start from January to December.
 1. Partech Ventures Launches Partech Africa, a $70M Africa focused VC Fund
 The launch of Partech Africa Fund was among the big news of January 2018. What was more interesting was that they chose to headquarter the fund in Francophone West Africa (Dakar, Senegal). The region hasnt been as blessed with funding as compared to its counterpart, Anglophone West Africa. Though headquartered in the fund is yet to make any investments in Francophone West Africa. Their first investment was into Nigerias TradeDepot followed by another into South Africas Yoco. In October, Partech Ventures went ahead to close a further €7 million from the AfDB. According to that particular press release, Partech is targeting a total fund size of at least €100 million.
 2. Jibu Completes its $7M Series B Financing
 Jibu, a Rwanda-based social enterprise, completed its $7m Series B financing in February 2018. The startup had its first close of $2.3 million in May 2017 according to their SEC filings. Jibu equips entrepreneurs in emerging market communities to own businesses that ensure access to basic human necessities, with water as an anchor product, which is a  validation that social enterprises across the continent, too, can raise significant funding.
 3. BitPesa acquires TransferZero
 Not only were there few tech acquisitions across Africa, but most were also characterized by a foreign company snatching up the one on the continent. BitPesa was among those that reversed the trend. The blockchain payments platform acquired Spanish fintech, TransferZero, to set up their Madrid office. BitPesa was later followed by Nigerias Terragon Group (raised $5M from TLcom Capital) which acquired Singapore-based Bizense. While Magasin Général (French for General Store), a leading retailer in Tunisia, bought 80% stake in Tunisias leading online retailer, Founa. There was also a stressed acquisition of one of Nigerias highflying e-commerce startups  Konga  by Zinox Technologies as well as a couple of other acquisitions that we noted.
 4. Ethiopias M-BIRR raises $9.87M in equity funding
 M-BIRR is one of the leading mobile technology companies in Ethiopia and the leading mobile money service in the country. The $9.87 million round which the company raised in March 2018 has turned out to be the largest round of funding in Ethiopia for 2018. Standard Bank acted as the lead advisor for this funding raise. Part of the funding came from Germans DEG  Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft, and another from the European Investment Bank.
 5. Orange Digital Ventures makes its first investment in Africa
 Orange Digital Ventures Africa, the Orange investment fund’s new initiative for Africa launched in June 2017. The fund announced its first investment, in April 2018, as part of Africa’s Talking $8.6 million round alongside the IFC World Bank and Social Capital. The fund then went on to participate in Yocos Series B in September last year.
 6. Teliman received $700k from Toyotas Africa subsidiary to shake up Mali’s public transit
 In May, the World Bank and CFAO Automotive – the subsidiary of Toyota in Africa – joined forces to launch Mali’s first bike-hailing startup, Teliman. In Mali’s capital, Bamako, the population sits at 2.3 million and a proliferating – at 5%. As a result, the country’s road network is coming under increased pressure. Especially when it comes to public transportation. Prompting the need for a solution.
 7. Ugandas Tugende raised $5 million in debt
 Uganda is among the countries that have been promising when it comes to raising funding for the past five years. However, the countrys early-stage companies are still struggling when compared to those in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana and Egypt. Therefore, the $5 million debt raised by Tugende in July 2018 from OPIC was very much needed. It ended up being the highest round raised by a Ugandan tech company last year.
 8. Injini selects the second cohort of 7 Edtech startups, injects $280k into them
 Despite its crucial role in shaping the continent, the education sector is heavily neglected when it comes to funding. Therefore, the presence of edtech dedicated early-stage funds and incubators should be highly praised. Thats why Injini made it to this list. In July last year, the incubator announced its cohort of 7 startups and went ahead to inject a total of $280,000 into them.
 9. Golix ends ICO with $23M worth of tokens sold
 As July 2018 drew to a close, Golix, a Zimbabwe-based crypto exchange, brought to an end its ICO. The startup had set out to raise a total of $35 million but only managed to raise  a still remarkable  $23 million. The amount is the highest to be raised by any African startup through ICO. The other notable ICOs include SureRemits $7 million and Walas $1.2 million.
 10. Cape Town-based Jumo closed $52M from Goldman Sachs
 After raising this funding, Jumo was the first company to reveal its intentions to expand beyond Africa. Since then, Paga has also expressed interest in expanding beyond the African continent after it raised a $10 million Series B (II) from the Global Innovation Partners, which was also Goldmans second time it participated in around for a tech company in Africa. The first was with Jumia.
 11. Enova Robotics raised $1.6M
 Tunisia, like Uganda, is among the countries that are promising but still struggling to raise early-stage funding. However, Enova Robotics pulled in a $1.6 million round in September 2018. According to Menabytes, this was the highest for any Tunisian startup at the time. However, Expensya later raised $4.5 million in December 2018. We also landed on documents from the IFC that indicate Flat6Labs is raising a $10 million fund focused on the country.
 12.  Vezeeta raised $12 million Series C led by STV for its healthcare platform
 In September, Cairo-based healthtech startup Vezeeta raised a $12 million Series C round led by Saudi Arabia’s STV Capital, MENAs largest VC fund. The round was the largest-ever investment raised by an Egyptian startup at the time. However, Swvl has since taken over after it raised what is estimated to be $30 million in November 2018.
 13. Naspers acquires Webuycars for $94M
 Naspers, through OLX Group, acquired Webuycars for $94 million in September, which is the second highest acquisition amount for a tech company in 2018 after Experian acquired South Africas Compuscan for $263 million in December 2018. In June 2018, Naspers had also finalised its acquisition of South Africas leading e-commerce company  Takealot. Furthermore, in October of last year, the most valued African company by market cap, Naspers went ahead to announce its $300 million startup fund  Naspers Foundry  that will focus on South Africa.
 14. Blockbank raises $12M in ICO, buys a stake in Kenyas Spire bank
 In September, Blockbank  a blockchain bank (as you have guessed)  announced that it had acquired an undisclosed stake in Kenyas Spire Bank. Headquartered in Nairobi, the bank has total assets worth $180 million with 350,000 existing customers. This stake purchase came after the UK headquartered blockchain bank had concluded its $12 million ICO.
 15. Sompo Holdings buys a corporate minority stake in BitPesa for $5.02M
 Tokyo-based multinational, Sompo Holdings announced its partnership with BitPesa in November which also came with $5.02 million in funding. However, this was the first in a series of corporate minority investments that followed. In December, Jumia Group announced that it had received an undisclosed amount from French spirits group, Pernod Ricard. In the same month, M-Kopa also received funding from Japanse multinational, Sumitomo Corporation.
 16. Egypt’s leading bank established a fintech-focused corporate venture arm
 Commercial International Bank (CIB), one of Egypt’s leading banks, established a corporate venture arm in December. CVentures, the corporate venture capital firm will focus on investments into FinTechs. The firm will take part in Series A and Series B investment rounds in Egypt, the Middle East, Africa.
 17. Africa Tech Ventures closes $7.5M from AfDB for seed-stage investments
 In December 2018, The African Development Bank (AfDB) approved a $7.5 million investment into Africa Tech Ventures (ATV). ATV states that they “invest between $100,000 and $5 million”. But, “in exchange for a significant minority equity stake and can take part in multiple financing rounds”.
 18. The Carlyle Group agrees to invest $40M in Nigeria’s Wakanow
 Global alternative asset manager, The Carlyle Group, said it had agreed to invest $40 million in Wakanow. This private equity deal made Wakanow one of the most funded travel companies across Africa. This round equals South Africas TravelStart, founded in 1999, which raised a $40 million round from Amadeus Capital Partners in 2016.
 19. Cassava SmartTech lists on Zimbabwe Stock Exchange
 Cassava SmartTech, a former division of Econet, listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, which brought the number of companies listed on the exchange to 63. The company was also the first to list on the exchange since 2016. Econet Global, the international business of the Econet group, is now the majority shareholder in Cassava. It has a 35,01% while EWZL holds a 20% stake.

"Evelyn Namara&#8217;s Uginnovate re-brands to Vouch Digital
","
 Today, Uginnovate rebranded to Vouch Digital. The company made the announcement through a press release sent to us. The digital solutions startup will now operate as Vouch Digital Limited.
 
 
  
 
 
 On why they chose Vouch Digital, the statement says the new brand identity speaks clearly about the niche we’ve carved out for ourselves in the digital ecosystem.
 
 
  
 
 
 In the past one year, we’ve tested, piloted, and built digital voucher systems that have enabled thousands of farmers to access seed crops, post-harvest equipment as well as farming equipment, the press release added.
 
 
  
 
 
 In a conversation with Evelyn Namara, she called the rebranding one of the lessons in aligning what exactly you want to do with the client base. 
 
 
  
 
 
 She also stressed that the vision on which the company was built hasnt changed. Which is to champion digital platforms &amp; digital payment methods for a digital economy. 
 
 
  
 
 
 But, their new mission is to help programs, as well as partners, interpret the impact of their programs by using real-time accurate data derived from our digital platforms.
 
 
  
 
 
 Besides M-Voucher, the startup hopes to add another product called M-Voucher+. Which is a smart card voucher application likely to be released by end of Q1 this year.
 
 
  
 
 
 The M-Voucher+ will replace the voucher cards for cases where the beneficiary uses the service more than once. The smartcard will be more durable.
 
 
  
 
 
 We are positioning ourselves to build viable, scalable solutions in the distribution sector, part of the statement read.
 
 
  
 
 
 Founded in 2015, the company currently employees 8 people with Evelyn Namara as the CEO. It also has three board members. Including Teddy TMS Ruge, the founder of RainTree farms, Deborah Bryant Elzie the Program Director at the Institute for Disaster and Fragility Resilience and Niel Harper, the Managing Director of Octave Consulting Group. 
 
 
  
 
 
 It also has CK Japheth, the Founder of The Innovation Village, Lindsay Holley Handler the CEO  of Fenix International and Badru Ntege the Group CEO of NFT Consults as company advisors.
 
 
  
 
 
 Last year, the companys flagship product, M-Voucher, won several awards and was responsible for propelling the startup to number one on the Startup Digest Africa Founders Top 10 list.

"Becoming a magnet for manufacturing — How African countries can move beyond just sales and marketing
","
 
 
 I will always remember our discussion of Intel Corporation’s decision to open its semiconductor plant in Costa Rica in 1996 as an eager MBA student at Thunderbird School of Global Management in 2003.
 Although the plant was closed in 2014 due to the increasingly difficult global environment in which the company operates, the case study still presents some compelling lessons.
 Below is a direct quote from a report published by the World Bank in 1998 and reproduced in the book, “Global Lifelong Learning in the Global Knowledge Economy: Challenges for Developing Countries.”
 “In 1996 Costa Rica beat out Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand to become the site of Intel’s $300 million semiconductor assembly and test plant. Many factors made Costa Rica attractive to Intel — its stable economic and political system, its liberalized economy, a growing electronics sector, and incentives and tax breaks — but the crucial factor in securing its selection was it educated labor force.
 Since 1948, when democracy was restored, Costa Rica has placed a strong emphasis on education, adopting a demand-driven approach. The government invested heavily in education and technology training, and it adopted a bilingual ESL (English as Second Language) curriculum. Computers were introduced into elementary schools as early as 1988; by 1996 many schools were equipped with them.”

 The positive correlation between high-quality education and growth
 Research has shown that a positive correlation exists between high educational achievements, the quality of a nation’s labor force, and ultimately sustained economic growth, income generation, and development. According to Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2002), “an additional year of schooling increases incomes by 10%, while in very poor countries it can increase incomes by 20% or more.”
 As noted by Ricardo Hausmann, the renowned economist, and Harvard Professor, in a 2010 study, “Countries with few capabilities will be able to make few products and will have scant benefits from accumulating any individual additional capability. By contrast, countries with many capabilities would be able to produce many new products by combining any new capability with different subsets of the capabilities they already possess.”
 Dr. Hausmann further explains that, “comparative advantage evolves by countries moving from existing goods to “nearby” or related goods. The ability to add products to a country’s production set largely depends on the number of capabilities present in the country.”
 African countries would therefore be best served by investing in building their capabilities to strengthen economic diversification and gain a comparative advantage in key sectors that will drive job growth and income generation.
 In addition, in the knowledge economy, “once countries achieve literacy rates of 40% they can accelerate economic growth by opening their economies to technology transfer.” This is what Costa Rica did; which ultimately resulted in their selection by Intel.
 It perhaps also explains why a number of companies and start-ups are flocking to Rwanda. UNICEF Rwanda reports that “Rwanda is one of the top-performing countries in sub-Saharan Africa in education, having achieved Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 2 for access to Universal Primary Education, with a net enrolment rate of 97.7per cent (boys: 97.3%; girls: 98%) (MINEDUC 2016).
 In terms of gender equality in education, Rwanda’s education system boasts the highest participation rates in East Africa as well as gender parity in net and gross enrolment at the pre-primary, primary, and secondary levels.”
 The country further embarked upon an ambitious program of curriculum reform, which culminated in its transformation into a competency-based curriculum that extends from pre-primary through upper secondary school.
 Its vision is to transform the economy into a knowledge-based one by 2020, better equipping children with the skills and competencies they need to fully participate in its future labor market. Finally, the government’s adoption of technology and promoting innovation creates positive externalities in strengthening the quality of the tiny nation’s labor force.
 Push for Nationwide Human Capital Development, including rural areas
 Other African countries should learn from these experiences to seriously tackle the issue of human capital development. They must be dogged in pursuing real transformation in the education sector.
 Overhauling the existing curriculum is a crucial first step; which must be closely followed by significant improvements in the quality of instruction and in the utilization of technology and teaching aids from the early years.

 Moreover, the quality and number of teachers from the primary through to the tertiary levels must be strengthened, and not only in urban areas. Countries need to figure out how to deploy teachers en masse to underserved rural communities. The local governments obviously sit on the frontline in this regard.
 How the Visiola Foundation complements public education
 The Visiola Foundation, through its partnership with the FCT Secondary Education Board in Nigeria, works to improve educational outcomes for students attending public schools to help them learn valuable skills, embrace technology, and become employable.
 Our After-School STEM Clubs for Girls (ASCG) program has worked in 15 Government Secondary Schools across the Federal Capital Territory since 2016 teaching Robotics, Science, Engineering, and Computer Programming to 950 junior and senior secondary school girls.
 This guiding principle also informs our diverse camps that teach girls and young women about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), while building their confidence and interest in the STEM fields. We focus on girls in order to bridge the wide gender gap in the STEM fields, while directly tackling the limiting cultural stereotypes and barriers.
 Since 2015, the Foundation’s STEM Camps have exposed 155 teenage girls in Ghana and Nigeria to the STEM fields. Students have been taught how to code, build robots, conduct scientific experiments, and build renewable energy prototypes. Partners and sponsors have included Schneider Electric West Africa, Young Engineers Nigeria, Intel Semiconductor West Africa, and Cargill Corporation.
 The Foundation’s widely publicized Coding Boot Camps and Workshops in Abuja, Enugu, Ibadan, and Lagos have taught over 160 young women how to code and build mobile applications.
 Students have gone on to complete internships at Quanteq Technology Ltd., while others have secured better paid, full-time jobs and freelance opportunities. The camps have been supported by tech companies, including Google Corporation and Cellulant Nigeria.
 There is a lot of work to be done but with the right type of leadership focused on building human capital, countries can indeed become magnets for manufacturing as Rwanda, Costa Rica, and others have shown.

"KENNETH LEGESI: A Look at the Alternative Sources of Funding for Ugandan Startups
","Ugandan startups can be thought of as businesses that are an idea, seed and or early stage variously. For a business, at the Idea stage, there may be an initial business plan and the entrepreneur is assessing market potential.
 At seed stage product development, marketing, and further market research are conducted to refine a prototype. Finally, at an early stage, there is a proven and tested prototype or model with progress to initial commercial production and sales.
 Following the idea, seed, and early stage, for a later stage business, there is ready production and sales. The business is operating as a commercial entity with much higher chances of survival than a startup and more options for funding.
 Yet the idea, seed and early stage of a business are the riskiest stages of a business. This is when it needs the most patient type of capital or funding  typically 5 – 7 years. This is when it needs the most support in form of mentorship, technical assistance, tax breaks and incentives, supportive government policy  just like nurturing a child.
 For Ugandan startups, what then are the options available to ensure survival and growth?
 When one scours the universe of conventional sources of funding for startups, these include  in order as the business grows  grants; awards and competitions; family and friends; angel investors; and venture capital funds. With the latter two being the key bridge to scaling and growth.
 At a later stage, a business may seek private equity funding, bank debt/loans and the stock exchange as sources of funds. In the case of Ugandan startups, local angel investors and local venture capital funds are few and far in between.
 While family and friends rarely have resources deep enough to sustain a startup for long. Consequently, startups mostly rely on founder’s own funds, grants, awards, and competitions. This makes for a tough funding environment, stunts growth and reduces further the already dismal chances of survival.
 As one awaits growth in and vibrant presence of a local angel investor and venture capital market, there are other sources of funding that could be awakened. These can be tailored to suit and can act as providers of funding for Ugandan startups.
 In the end, they can form the spine of a local angel investor and venture capital network. These include SACCOs, investment clubs, and provident funds or retirement benefit schemes.
 These are already available, still untapped and dormant when it comes to investing in local startups.
 How then can these alternatives albeit reluctant investors play a key role in funding local startups?
 To appreciate the scale of potential investment, there are conservatively over 1,000 investment clubs and over 65 licensed and registered retirement benefit schemes in Uganda.

 Combined, they hold an estimated portfolio of over UGX 1 trillion in assets and growing. So, assuming a conservative allocation of 1% to startups would represent UGX 10bn (USD 2.7m) in investment, this may support up to 100 startups!
 For investment clubs and retirement benefit schemes to play in the local startup scene, firstly, there is a need for awareness, education, and appreciation that in spite of the risks associated with startups, they do provide an opportunity for investment return upside with diversification benefits in any portfolio of investments.
 Secondly, investment clubs and retirement benefit schemes should make a conscious decision to allocate a proportion of their portfolio to investments in startups.
 An allocation may be anywhere up to 10% of the investment portfolio depending on determined investment objectives and risk appetite as guided by an Investment Policy or working with an Investment Advisor.
 As a guide, the Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority (Investments of Scheme Funds) Regulations, 2014 gives guidance up to a maximum of 15% allocation in Private Equity in the East African Community and 5% in other asset classes.

 Thirdly to invest in startups, investment clubs and retirement benefit schemes would need a structure through which to invest.
 This can be done at an individual organization level or perhaps through an investment vehicle or fund bringing together like-minded investors to benefit from economies of scale in sourcing, diversification, and oversight of investments.
 The sourcing of startups to invest in can be through partnerships with other like-minded investors or by approaching local accelerators, hubs, and incubators.
 Once a startup for investment has been identified, due diligence would need to be undertaken ahead of any final investment decision and post-investment monitoring of the investment would commence until exit at an appropriate time to meet investment objectives.
 Exit maybe through sell to other investors like Angel investors, Venture capital funds, Private equity or sell back to the founder or recapitalization of the business following growth.
 Investment clubs and retirement benefit schemes should step up and take this opportunity not only to invest in the startups but to also provide mentorship, guidance, networks, and relationships to the startups to catalyze growth while making decent returns.
 This solves the dual problem of lack of capital and support needed to ensure the success of local startups.

"Ethiopia&#8217;s ride-hailing service proprietor secures additional funding
","Zaytech, the proprietor of ZayRide  a ride-hailing service in Ethiopia  has closed an undisclosed amount of funding. The company, which made the announcement in a press release on December 30, 2018, also remained tight-lipped on who the investors were.
 Instead wrote that they successfully and significantly raised equity capital which attracted significant interest from the technology investing world both locally and internationally, especially from diaspora investors.
 According to Zekarias Amsalu, founder and MD of IBEX FRONTIER  Digest Africas data partner for Ethiopia  this is the startups second known round of funding.
 He also helped decode what Zaytechs message implies:
 
 To put the [sic] perspective of what significant investment it means, you may refer to the 2017 report where they raised below $200K, but this round is significantly higher than this though they did not disclose the deal (amount).
 
 Following the fundraising, Zaytech is now looking at diversifying its offerings to anchor ZayRide. The equity raise provides Zaytech with the necessary financing to roll out its ambitious growth plans, the startup wrote.
 The startup also added that it would enable them:
 launch additional complementary and game-changing innovative products in Ethiopia, expand market penetration and increase its talent pool significantly as it plans to roll out further products and enter new markets in the coming months.
 Founded by Habtamu Tadesse, an Ethiopian-born entrepreneur who moved to the US at the age of 12, Zaytech started operations in 2016 as an Ethiopian taxi hailing startup, and it is still known to many as ZayRide.

 With close to 105 million people, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, after Nigeria. Despite such a market size, the country lags behind others like Kenya with less than half their size. That is partly because the state operated a closed economy model for quite some time. That is why companies like Uber, Jumia (tried entering but exited) and others found it hard to set up shop there.
 The closed economy model left the opportunity to the locals to set up the alternatives to what international upstarts like Uber and Jumia offer. Deliver Addis, for example, launched in 2015 by Feleg Tsegaye is an alternative to Uber Eats and Jumia Food.
 It is, however, anticipated that the country will see more and more multinational service providers enter the market with the reforms that kicked in starting early last year. According to our Digest Africa Index report, the countrys early stage and technology companies raised a total of $13 million in 2018. But, more than half of that  $9.87 million  came from M-BIRRs funding deal.

 Asked what changes will be made as they head for public beta, Solomon pointed out that they plan to favor mobile as feedback from the private beta testers indicated that they prefer having to monitor their sales and inventory on mobile as opposed to the web.
 We are also planning to allow flexibility  as opposed to fixing them  in the pricing of the inventory as Ugandans still prefer bargaining and haggling over the prices of products and services, Solomon added.
 One of the challenges Solomon Kitumba anticipates is the possibility of crippling at scale since they are making a huge leap from 25 users to 200.

"Here&#8217;s the letter Jack Ma has written to Alibaba staff about his retirement
","Towards the end of last week, Alibaba founder  Jack Ma  told the New York Times that he was stepping down from the company that he founded 19 years ago.
 Below is the full letter in text from Jack Ma to employees, customers, and investors as sourced from Bloomberg. The letter details his plans to retire as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in exactly 12 months’ time and hand leadership to Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang.
 However, Ma will remain on the board of the Hangzhou-based e-commerce giant until Alibaba’s shareholder meeting in 2020 according to Bloomberg.
 
 Dear Alibaba customers, Aliren, and shareholders,
 Today, as we mark the 19th anniversary of Alibaba, I am excited to share some news with you: with the approval of our board of directors, one year from today on September 10, 2019 which also falls on Alibaba’s 20th anniversary, Group CEO Daniel Zhang will succeed me as chairman of the board of Alibaba Group. While remaining as executive chairman in the next 12 months, I will work closely with Daniel to ensure a smooth and successful transition. Thereafter, I will stay on the Alibaba board of directors until our annual shareholders meeting in 2020.
 I have put a lot of thought and preparation into this succession plan for ten years. I am delighted to announce the plan today thanks to the support of the Alibaba Partnership and our board of directors. I also want to offer special thanks to all Alibaba colleagues and your families, because your trust, support and our joint enterprise over the past 19 years have prepared us for this day with confidence and strength.
 This transition demonstrates that Alibaba has stepped up to the next level of corporate governance from a company that relies on individuals, to one built on systems of organizational excellence and a culture of talent development.
 When Alibaba was founded in 1999, our goal was to build a company that could make China and the world proud and one that could cross three centuries to last 102 years. However, we all knew that no one could stay with the company for 102 years. A sustainable Alibaba would have to be built on sound governance, culture-centric philosophy, and consistency in developing talent. No company can rely solely on its founders. Of all people, I should know that. Because of physical limits on one’s ability and energy, no one can shoulder the responsibilities of chairman and CEO forever.
 We asked ourselves this question 10 years ago – how could Alibaba achieve sustainable growth after Jack Ma leaves the company? We believed the only way to solve the problem of corporate leadership succession was to develop a system of governance based on a unique culture and mechanisms for developing consistent talent and successors. For the last 10 years, we kept working on these ingredients.
 Having been trained as a teacher, I feel extremely proud of what I have achieved. Teachers always want their students to exceed them, so the responsible thing to do for me and the company to do is to let younger, more talented people take over in leadership roles so that they inherit our mission “to make it easy to do business anywhere.” Carrying out this mission in order to help small businesses, young people and women around the world is my passion. This is not only our intent from day one but I feel blessed to have this opportunity. To realize the dream behind this mission requires participation by a lot more people than just Jack Ma and persistent effort by generations of Aliren.
 Alibaba is amazing not because of our business or scale or accomplishments. The best thing about Alibaba is that we come together under a common mission and vision. Our partnership system, unique culture and talented team have laid a strong foundation for the legacy of our company. In fact, since I handed over the CEO’s responsibilities in 2013, the company has run smoothly for five years on the back of these institutional ingredients.
 The partnership system we developed is a creative solution to good governance and sustainability, as it overcomes several challenges faced by companies of scale: continuous innovation, leadership succession, accountability and cultural continuity. Over the years, in iterating our management model, we have experimented with and improved on the right balance between systems and individuals. Simply relying on individuals or blindly following a system will not solve our problems. To achieve long-term sustainable growth, you need the right balance among system, people and culture. I have full confidence that our partnership system and efforts to safeguard our culture will in time win over the love and support from customers, employees and shareholders.
 Since the founding of the company in 1999, we have been of the view that Alibaba’s future will need to depend on “droves of talent” to enable us to iterate on our management succession plans. After years of hard work, today’s Alibaba has a world-class talent pool in quality and quantity. The teacher in me feels extremely proud of our team, our leadership and our unique mission-driven culture, as well as the fact that we continue to develop exceptional business leaders and professional talent like Daniel Zhang.
 Daniel has been with Alibaba Group for 11 years. Since he took over as CEO, he has demonstrated his superb talent, business acumen and determined leadership. Under his stewardship, Alibaba has seen consistent and sustainable growth for 13 consecutive quarters. His analytical mind is unparalleled, he holds dear our mission and vision, he embraces responsibility with passion, and he has the guts to innovate and test creative business models. Deservedly, China’s business news media has named him the No.1 CEO in 2018. For these reasons, he and his team have won the trust and support of customers, employees and shareholders. Starting the process of passing the Alibaba torch to Daniel and his team is the right decision at the right time, because I know from working with them that they are ready, and I have complete confidence in our next generation of leaders.
 As for myself, I still have lots of dreams to pursue. Those who know me know that I do not like to sit idle. I plan on continuing my role as the founding partner in the Alibaba Partnership and contribute to the work of the partnership. I also want to return to education, which excites me with so much blessing because this is what I love to do. The world is big, and I am still young, so I want to try new things – because what if new dreams can be realized?!
 The one thing I can promise everyone is this: Alibaba was never about Jack Ma, but Jack Ma will forever belong to Alibaba.

"Ugandan SMEs to get  a boost as the country secures $20 Million loan from AfDB
","Uganda, through Uganda Development Bank [UDBL], has secured a $20 million loan from Africa Development Bank to support Ugandan SMEs. AfDB made the announcement through a press release.
 “The African Development Bank has approved a US$20 million loan to the Uganda Development Bank Limited (UDBL),” wrote AfDB.
 The funds are to offer long-term financing to Ugandan SMEs. This is due to a scarcity of financing options for them as many financial institutions regard them as risky.
 According to AfDB, this loan will allow UDBL to “provide long-term funding to deserving” SMEs.
 
 “It also reinforces its role as a national development bank in implementing Uganda’s National Development Plan and complementing the institution’s efforts to diversify its funding base and mobilize resources from external sources.”
 
 Although UDBLs focus is to “enhance the country’s private sector development”, it has before funded only a few sectors.
 “Historically, UDBL intervenes in the agriculture and agro-processing, hotel and tourism, education, health, and manufacturing sectors,” wrote AfDB.
 Yet with this recent loan, the bank might explore other sectors. Thats if you look at the set of objectives AfDB hopes UDBL will achieve with the loan.
 Also read: Tunisia set to launch use of drones in agriculture pilot project supported by AfDB
 Some of the objectives include advancing the country’s financial inclusion, gender, and social welfare aspirations.
 It will further contribute towards the provision of quality and low-cost education and health services, helping to narrow the widening social and income gaps in the country.
 This should be particularly of interest to any startups that are playing in the financial, education and health technology space.
 The loan is structured in two formats; $15 million and $5 Million for 10 and 5 years respectively.
 “The financial package comprises of a 10-year US$15 million Sovereign Guaranteed Line of Credit for on-lending to projects in various sectors and a US$5 million Non-Sovereign Line of Credit to support a financing program for SMEs.”
 According to AfDB, “the [loan] facility aligns with the African Development Bank’s Uganda Country Strategic Paper (CSP) 2017-2021 and Financial Sector Strategy (2014-2019).”
 Thus, AfDB hopes that this will “enhance the country’s private sector development as beneficiaries’ businesses and revenues grow, with the associated positive impact on government’s tax income.”
 Earlier on this year, AfDB also approved a $30 Million towards supporting the Rwanda Innovation Fund.

"The Hunt: Ugandan Version of Shark Tank Coming Next Week
","A lot has been said about startups in Africa not getting funding. For those that do get, it is little. Yet few are talking about or thinking of addressing the issue of making these startups investor ready.
 When you talk to Venture Capitals firms across the continent, they will tell you that theres money to invest in companies or startups. However, the question is, are the companies to invest this money in there?
 Reports by World Bank and other Africa-focused research organizations will tell you how Africa is surging with Entrepreneurs. However, few of these will go a step further to tell you what percentage of these can face an investor and get what theyre looking for.
 GoBigHub  a microfinancing company that connects SMEs as well as startups to investors is looking to bridge this gap. They want to make sure that startup founders are ready to tap into investors money.
 They are looking to fix this problem through an entertaining program, a show called The Hunt.
 Investors and entrepreneurs will be put in a room and the investors will ask critical questions about the viability of the entrepreneurs ideas and companies. After which, they shall teach the entrepreneurs how to best pitch their ideas and provide any additional information.
 As a microfinancing organization, one of the major challenges weve seen is the lack of documentation and preparation from small businesses, as they are mostly family run  Madeline Pollack, Projects Executive at GoBigHub
 Not wanting to be mistaken for a Shark Tank mimick, Madeline says that it shall be unique because these will be micro-entrepreneurs and local investors, making them more relatable to the Kampala and African audience
 They are planning to shoot and publish their first episode next week. Theyll kickstart by airing the videos on youtube then possibly on television with time. So far, they have some entrepreneurs and investors lined up.
 Though, they would love to reach out to other entrepreneurs and investors who might be interested in participating in The Hunt. Secondly, theyre also encouraging people to view this program so that, even though not participating, they can learn a thing too.
 For the first season, four episodes will be shot and each will have three investors and six entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs segment will last about 5 minutes and each episode lasting 30 minutes.
 Apart from the entrepreneurs pitching their products, they are encouraged to use any other things but are subject to by the GoBigHub team. Some of the suggested include photos, videos, customer feedback, awards etc.
 For those looking to join The Hunt as Investors, you should be an African who is physically available to shoot the show. The other qualifier is that you should be looking to invest a minimum of UGX 2 million (roughly $600) in local enterprises.
 Entrepreneurs must be Ugandan residents and businesses with ideas that need capital. However, all the investments made on air are still subject to further due diligence. For more details, contact Ojijo Pascal, the founder of GoBigHub, on ojijo@gobighub.com

"Alibaba founder Jack Ma to visit all African countries in 15 years
","Billionaire Alibaba Founder and Executive Chairman, Jack Ma, launched the Jack Ma Foundation Netpreneuer Prize yesterday in Johannesburg, South Africa.
 The prize is a $10 Million grant that will be won by small businesses working to grow the continent’s digital economy. These will compete for $1 million in prize money every year for the next 10 years.
 During his speech, Jack Ma gave all indications that he is now ready to bet on Africa and for the long term. This is despite the fact that he had no interest in the continent a few years ago.
 Last year was my first trip to Africa, but before I came to Africa, I worried a lot like anybody else, Ma said. Yet, he used the opportunity to announce that from now onwards, he will be visiting at least 3 African countries every year.
 From now on, every year, I will come to Africa and visit three countries, Ma pointed out, and hopes that in the next 10 to 15 years he can finish visiting the 54 countries in Africa. Which is the entire continent!
 Jack Ma says that his attitude towards Africa has changed over time after interacting with the young entrepreneurs doing work across the continent. He says that these inspired him and made him realize that Africa is a continent full of opportunities.
 Jack Ma visited Africa for the very first time last year and toured Kenya, Somalia as well as Rwanda. This time around, he toured Ethiopia, Botswana and South Africa. On his first trip, he was impressed by the fast wifi in Nairobi which he said was faster than in some parts of the US.
 Yet, that wasnt all the e-commerce, logistics and payments enthusiast realized about the continent. He saw a lot of opportunities unexplored on the continent and decided something must be done.
 When I left Africa last year, I felt that something should be done. And a lot of things can be done, Ma said.
 So far, Jack Mas support has come in form of the Alibaba eFounders Initiative that they are running with the UNCTAD  The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
 Also read: These are the Ugandan startups in Hangzhou participating in Alibaba’s eFounders Initiative
 He committed to supporting 1000 entrepreneurs from Developing countries and 200 of these will come from Africa. So far, around 80 have been admitted in two cohorts of the eFounders Fellowship.
 The other step Jack Ma has taken is the $10 Million prize by his foundation. Though, he believes that it is little money compared to what governments spend as well as what entrepreneurs are capable of doing.
 This Netpreneur prize is the beginning. The $10 Million prize is nothing. It is not big compared to the other people like governments that spend, Jack said.
 He also offered to grant access to both Alibaba and Alipays technologies to all governments and entrepreneurs who are looking to build solutions solving e-commerce, logistics and payments problems.
 You dont have ePayment, the technology is there. Alibaba will do anything to share the technology, Jack Ma
 Additionally, Jack Ma  when asked a question about the outdated curriculum on the continent  he expressed his willingness to work with Universities. This will surround e-commerce and cloud computing. Topics Jack Ma believes should be well understood across the continent.
 
 [What] we want to do in Africa is we are thinking about having training centers in Africa. We are gonna have five hubs for training centers. We are gonna be happy to work with universities. We let universities have [an] understanding of e-commerce and cloud computing.
 
 After all this, he hopes that his company  Alibaba  can come in a few decades later and takes a small part of what they would have helped build.
 We hope 10 to 20 years later when Africa is successful, we can get a tiny [part of the market].
 He also pointed out the areas where he thinks opportunities still exist; tourism, payments, and logistics.
 These are also indicated in the type of ventures admitted into the Alibaba eFounders Fellowship. Most  if not all  were from those sectors; Flutterwave, RoundBob, Intership and more.
 Also read: Flutterwave expands to Uganda making it their fourth African market
 Plus, Jack Ma first paid a visit to Cape Town before Johannesburg. There he awarded 50 rangers and said that such people should be hailed as the heroes of today. Further showing his commitment to tourism on the continent.
 200 years ago people killing animals were the heroes, now people protecting animals should be the heroes, Ma said.
 Throughout his speech, Ma gave his usual self-belief and hope-filled advice to the entrepreneurs across the continent. That ranged from building the products, patience, embracing challenges as well as seeing the opportunities around them.
 People say Africa has a lot of problems, but tell me a place in the world without problems? Ma pointed out. Adding that entrepreneurs should be used to having no government or any form of support.
 [If] people help you, that is unusual. [If] people dont want to help you, that is very usual, Ma said. You have to get used to not being supported. When youre lonely, use your left hand to warm your right hand.
 But, he also advised governments to focus on giving startups good conditions especially when it comes to taxation.
 Everyone country in this world should give good tax conditions to startups, not the big companies, he pointed out. Adding that it is time to get policies for startup and young companies.
 He also encouraged entrepreneurs to think outside the box by building products that will scale beyond their countries and the continent.
 Do not think about your own country. Think about the whole [of] Africa and the rest of the world. If you only think about your own country, theres no difference between thinking about your own country and your village.

"This Ugandan startup is using Drones in an unconventional way
","When you talk about drones in Africa, most think of the much-publicized use of drones to deliver blood in Rwanda. Another quick one would be a similar case in Tanzania [pdf].
 Uganda isn’t likely to come top of mind among the top testing grounds for drones. Despite East Africa having a tag as a leading testing ground for drones in the world.
 The first publicly known case of Drone application success in East Africa was in Rwanda. After collaborating with Zipline. A tech company from Silicon Valley. It applied drones to the delivery of blood to its transfusion centres around the country. Zipline also partnered with the Tanzanian government to do the same.
 Recently, Nairobi was selected as “one of the launch cities for an ambitious flying cars plan.” This was by McFly.aero. A blockchain project looking to set up the infrastructure for air taxis service in 23 cities.
 All these activities make one believe Uganda is lagging behind. Yet, that doesn’t seem to be the case.
 DroneNerds, a Ugandan startup is pioneering the usage of drones in unconventional areas. The startup describes itself as a “company that seeks to leverage, derisk and leapfrog the positive benefits of drone technology for positive social impact.”
 True to their word, DroneNerds has started deploying drones in humanitarian and environment conservation areas.
 Effects of sand mining on the environment
 According to Silver Kayondo, a co-founder, they “have supported humanitarian efforts in Bidi Bidi refugee camp.” The aim is to “use drone technology to monitor conflicts spots between the refugee community and the host community.”
 “Once these are identified, we can work with other justice sector players to take tailored mediation centres to the camps. We are also deploying the technology in environmental management and detection of the negative effects of open-pit sand mining around the Lake Victoria basin and the impact on water quality.”
 Besides that, the startup deploys drones to support environmental conservation.
 “Our aim is to use drones to augment environmental justice enforcement and compliance through sharing evidence-based findings with activists/civil society, regulatory bodies (National Environmental Management Authority) and other stakeholders,” DroneNerds says.
 Open sand pits left after sand mining
 Land and natural resource degradation in Uganda account for over 80% of the annual costs of environmental degradation. This arises from activities such as deforestation, artisan mining and air pollution. Yet, it is hard to check the degradation of the natural resources like forests. Partly due to inaccessibility and the costs involved.
 DroneNerds says that they are presenting an “effective tool for environmental monitoring and enforcement” because of its ability to “reach areas that would be otherwise inaccessible or cost-prohibitive.”
 The startup is not the first to go in this direction.
 In 2013, the Guardian reported that Drones were being used in game reserves in South Africa to check poachers. “We bought the equipment to try and combat Rhino poaching before they are all gone, Anton Kieser told the Guardian. Elsewhere, campaigners used drones in the fight against whaling in Japan.
 So far, DroneNerds has kicked off its efforts with a pilot project aimed at conserving the environment. It is aimed at “examining the implications of sand mining on the ecosystem around Kampala’s wetland system.”
 The startup adds that; “Under this pilot project, we discovered that open pit sand mining in Kampala not only causes environmental degradation through destruction of vegetative cover, but also leaves behind open pits which are breeding grounds for mosquitoes that spread malaria.”

 Aside from environmental conservation, DroneNerds is also using drones to “leapfrog over poor infrastructure that characterizes most parts of rural Uganda, and specifically, refugee host communities.”
 It has so far “worked on a special project in the Bidi Bidi refugee camp, the world’s largest refugee camp located in Northwestern Uganda.”
 This settlement covers a geographical area of about 250 square kilometres. It mainly hosts refugees from Southern Sudan. The number estimated by the American Refugee Committee is about 270,000 refugees.
 Due to this population surge, there have emerged some conflicts between the refugees and the host community.
 To identify and seek resolution of such conflict, DroneNerds worked on an independent project to identify the major conflict causes between the refugees and the host community using drone monitoring and reporting systems along the potential conflict spots.
 Other areas the startup is venturing drone usage into is photography/videography. Using them for news, events, leisure and hospitality as well as tourism.
 Agriculture is another area. With plans to “deploy drone technology in soil and field analysis, drone-planting analysis, crop spraying, crop monitoring, irrigation and crop health assessments.”
 Sports is also on their radar. The startup believes that Drones are “useful in live sports coverage, sports commentary, broadcasting, training, crowd control and security, sports photography and sports performance analysis.”
 When it comes to health, DroneNerds hopes to build on the success stories in Rwanda, Tanzania and other African countries where drones have been used to deliver medical supplies. “We seek to build on these success stories to provide solutions that can solve problems such as delays in delivery of essential drugs and medicines.”

 In law, they plan to offer more of consultation services. Given that their Co-Founder, Silver Kayondo is one of the “leading authority on drone law in Uganda.” A legal Associate at Bowmans Uganda, Silver also has a Masters of Law from the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Chances are also that you won’t talk about Drones in Uganda and his name fails to come up.
 Beside DroneNerds, Jumia Food Uganda tried using Drones last year. But their efforts were intercepted by the government. “We tried to launch limited delivery with drones in Kampala but CAA just made it legal to operate drones in November 2017,” Ron Kawamara, MD Jumia Food East Africa says.
 “The catch however is that drones only allowed with on-sight operation. In other-words the operator must maintain visual contact with the drone which would not work for us. Rwanda has taken a different approach and we see companies and NGOs using drones to reach remote areas to deliver lifesaving cargo. Jumia Kenya will also try drone deliveries later this year [2018].”
 With a legal background, Silver fully understands the regulatory framework around the usage of drones in Uganda. Yet he points out “the unpredictable regulatory environment” as one of the challenges they’re facing. “Currently, importing a drone requires clearance by URA, CAA and Ministry of Defence,” Silver says.
 “In my view as a lawyer servicing the drone industry and as a co-founder of a drone start-up, the regulations do not draw any distinctions between military drones, commercial drones and hobby drones. Then, there is general lack of awareness of the service capability of commercial drones.”
 When Jumia Food tried to inquire about the possibility of using drones through their legal representative, they got in return a lengthy procedure. An email we got an opportunity to look at required Jumia Food to first “obtain a letter of No-Objection from the line ministry to use Remotely Piloted Aircraft Technology in the planned activity.”
 Then, “seek a letter of No-Objection from the Chief of Defence Forces(CDF) which may involve security vetting.” And finally “fill in an Authorization Request Form and submit it together with the letters of no objection to CAA.”
 The email also noted that “currently drone operations clearance is limited to Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) operations only.” According to CAA, the body is currently “only granting permission for usage of drones with Visual Line of Sight (VLOS).” Those that can be seen while being used.

 But CAA says that “by the end of 2018, Uganda will have regulations that clearly separate and categorize drones from Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS).”
 This is because it deems the use of drones likely to cause “possible dangers” which include “accidental collision” of drones with “passenger aircraft and misuse including breach of national and other people’s privacy.”
 The authority also admits that “there has been an influx of drones into the country, many of them have unfortunately been held up at customs at Entebbe International Airport pending fulfilment of security clearance and other procedural requirements.”
 Aside from regulatory challenges, Silver pointed out that they have a challenge of getting access to funding. “The major challenge for any start-up is financing,” Silver said. “There are not many grants and VCs targeting drone technology in Uganda. So, growth is limited.”Despite the fact that “the market potential is enormous.
 So far, Silver says that they have been able to secure some clients and partners to work with. “For instance, we are in talks with the Uganda Insurance Association for deployment of drones in insurance claims assessments.”
 While as Ron was going to procure his drones from Flirtey, a Reno, Nevada-based drone delivery company, DroneNerds procures theirs from Dji, a Shenzen-based technology company.
 DroneNerds recently completed formal incorporation as a company in 2018. Though it was set up in 2017 and has been engaging with drone flying and repairs since 2013.

"Meet the Ugandan Engineers Working With Andela &#8211; Episode 1
","Andela recently launched in Uganda. This brought its presence on the African continent to 3 countries, namely Uganda, Kenya, and Nigeria. 
 If you dont know what Andela does, it offers Software developers an opportunity to work for its clients  which in this case include some of the top companies in the US and the world  like IBM, Microsoft etc.
 Since its inception, it has been able to take on several developers  Ugandans included. We have therefore decided to start a series that will celebrate Ugandan developers working with Andela  a couple of them at a time.
 In this very first, we are celebrating as well as getting to know more about two of the Ugandan developers working with Andela.
 David Kironde
 David, aged 23 years, joined Andela last year on the 20th of November. We asked him a few questions about his experience with Andela. Find the details of the conversation below;
 
 
 Area/Course of Study: Bachelor of Business computing
 University:  Makerere University Business School
 Field of expertise: Full Stack Developer Python Flask
 Project:  Pulse was built with ES6 AngularJs and Node.js running on a micro-service architecture as opposed to monolithic architecture.
 
 1. What prompted you to apply to Andela?
 My passion for software development, my desire to learn, grow and build my professional networks. Andela gives me all that. When I learned about Andela, it was the perfect time for me. To me, Andela is an answered prayer.
 2. What is the most exciting experience you’ve had at Andela so far?
 I built a URL shortener early on when I had minimal programming experience. This gave me such joy and instilled confidence in me that if I believe in myself, the sky is not the limit, it’s only the beginning.
 3. Where do you see yourself a year from today and how does being part of Andela help you get there?
 A year from today, I will be a Senior Developer at Andela. I desire to innovate and head a company and I believe that Andela will help me achieve that.

  Christine Ritah Nagadya
 Christine, aged 25 years, actually joined Andela this year on the 5th of June. Similarly, we had a quick conversation with her and below are some of the details;
 
 
 Area/Course of Study: BSc Electrical Eng &amp; MSc Innovation and Entrepreneurship
 University:  Makerere University &amp; Newcastle University
 Project: Im part of a simulated agile software development team working on a project called Health Checks project. Health Checks is a monitoring system for cron jobs that notifies users about the different status of the jobs i.e. success, warnings (jobs that have not run but are still within the set grace period) and failed jobs. I’m also working on a personal project building a web API for a Bucket List service(personal project).
 
 1. What prompted you to apply to Andela?
 I heard about Andela from a friend and did a quick Google search which led me to this article. I got hooked the moment I saw the title (because I’m always up for a challenge) and was convinced that Andela was the place for me.
 When I read the rest of the article, I became determined to join because despite enjoying the work I previously did, I’d always wanted more, I wanted to be an excellent software engineer.
 2. What is the most exciting thing youve experienced at Andela so far?
 Everything! For a person who only had experience in application interface design and development, a shift to work on functionality and logic is extremely exciting. Stuff suddenly makes sense, just like puzzle pieces falling into place.
 Additionally, Andelans are beyond awesome. Every single person I have interacted with so far has selflessly supported and challenged me to not just be a better programmer but a better person as well.
 3. Where do you see yourself a year from today and how does being part of Andela help you get there?
 I can not even begin to imagine where, because Andela has widened my horizons. I thought I would never come close to being referred to as ‘that top notch programmer, but now it’s just a matter of time. It has just been a month and Ive solely built two applications and I am currently working on my third personal and first group project at Andela.

"In Brief: The Government of Singapore has invested in Binance
","Singapores sovereign wealth fund is investing in the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange by way of its venture wing.
 Vertex Ventures, the venture capital arm of Temasek Holdings – which is operated by the government of Singapore – has made a strategic investment in Binance and will work with the exchange to set up a new branch in the city-state, the fund announced on Tuesday.
 The centerpiece of the plan is the creation of Binance Singapore, a fiat-to-crypto exchange, as well as other fiat-crypto services in Southeast Asia, according to press statements. Binance CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, first announced that the exchange would be expanding to Singapore last month.

"Uganda&#8217;s SafeBoda expanding to Kenya
","SafeBoda, a community of motorcycle taxi (boda-boda) drivers, is finally scaling out of Uganda. The ride-hailing startup, founded in 2015, is expanding to the Kenyan market.
 This was revealed by Nicholas Kamanzi, from Africas Talking, who briefly spoke about it at Swarm Summit last week. (See also: Communicate in a language that government officials and policymakers understand, Minister Frank Tumwebaze Tells Innovators).
 In a quick conversation with Maxime Dieudonne, SafeBodas co-founder and co-CEO, at Swarm, he declined to give a full interview about the expansion. However, he confirmed that it is true.
 In a further WhatsApp conversation, Maxime requested that we contact him towards the end of January 2018, as it is when he will be in a position to answer most of our questions.
 
 
 We cant provide much comments at this stage but if you contact me at the end of January I will be in a position to respond to your questions in details, Maxime wrote.
 
 
 SafeBoda co-founder and co-CEO Alastair Sussock was at iHub in Kenya mid-October this year to tell the Kenyan community more about SafeBoda as well as the regional expansion plans.
 With two CEOs, our guess is that one of them shall have to relocate to Kenya  though Maxime declined to comment on the questions regarding this. We also think that SafeBoda will most likely shift most of the operations to Kenya.
 This is partly due to the fact that when Nicholas Kamanzi was commenting about his conversation with Alastair, it was in the light of the cheaper internet in Kenya.
 And, given that SafeBoda is an internet company, itd make sense to have most of the operations in a country that has a more favourable environment for an internet company.
 Mid this year, SafeBoda participated in the Spring Accelerator and raised a non-equity undisclosed amount of funding. This amount is probably what theyre using for their expansion plans. (See also: SafeBoda, BareFoot Power Accepted in Spring Accelerator’s Third Cohort)
 This comes as good news for other Ugandan startups thatll be looking to expand regionally and across the continent.
 According to the blurb from iHub, about the startup, SafeBoda has +1,000 drivers in Kampala and since launching the app has seen over 40% monthly growth since launch.
 With all this activity in the year 2017, SafeBoda came in at number 4 in the Startup Digest Africa Founders Top 10 ranking for the year 2017. A ranking which was topped by two women-led startups.

"What you should know before participating in an ICO
","After a warning from Uganda’s central bank about OneCoin, there continue to be stories about other coins claimed to be Ponzi schemes. In spite of this, many cryptocurrencies are traded in the secondary market with ICOs as an investment opportunity. But how do you go about the process?
 So I am clear, this does not constitute investment advice. I thought it pertinent to share some general information about Cryptocurrencies and ICOs. As a buyer, beware for those seeking to take part in this exciting but very speculative and risky area.
 What are Initial Coin Offerings?
 ICOs are the process by which cryptocurrencies are created, launched on the market before they trade in a secondary market. Before listing in the secondary market, a cryptocurrency/coin comes into form through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).
 You can parallel an ICO to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for trading a stock for the first time. Subsequently, the coin or stock trades in the secondary market. But, before one participates in an ICO, it is important to understand the why, what and wherefores of.
 I share below some of the things to look out for before diving into owning a cryptocurrency or participating in an ICO. This is knowledge gained from reading up on the subject, and discussions with others more knowledgeable on the subject.
 Where to start?
 A good resource for viewing all coins trading in the secondary market is CoinMarketCap. This lists almost all the coins trading post-ICO in a secondary market. If it does not exist on Coin Market Cap, it probably is not a legitimate coin. The platform also lists the exchanges where coins are trading.
 As of 26/09/2018, there were 2003 coins listed at Coin Market Cap. To buy into or sell a coin, one would have to do so through one of the exchanges listed on the platform.
 Also read: Here are 8 notable ICOs by blockchain startups operating in Africa
 The top five (5) exchanges by volume traded as listed on CoinMarketCap in order are Binance, OKEx, Bitfinex, Huobi, and Bithumb. Yet, it is also possible to trade coins through willing buyers and sellers off the exchange. That is straight from wallets where the coins are held. Examples of wallets include Blockchain Wallet, Binance Wallet etc.
 How do you identify a genuine ICO?
 If an ICO is genuine, most of the information below should be available at the ICO project site;
 1. Coin and use case: What is the proposed coin and the associated use case? Does this make sense? Is there an economic rationale? What is the history of the founders? What problem are they trying to solve with blockchain? Does it fit with a relatable use case?
 2. Blockchain and protocol: Try to find out the blockchain being used and the associated protocol. This will give you an understanding of the blockchain properties. It will also help answer questions like; Will the scale of the blockchain be easy? Will demand be attracted to the blockchain? If yes, how quickly are transactions processed on the blockchain? Is the associated protocol secure and relatively hack proof? How does the protocol and blockchain model compare to peers?
 3. White paper: A white paper is a document which includes an outline of a problem that the block chain project is looking to solve. It provides the solution to that problem and a detailed description of their product, architecture and interaction with users. For example, a whitepaper database exists.
 4. Community Support: Is there a community associated with the coin or is one proposed? What activities does the community support? For example, it is common for a community to issue out grants to people/startups that are building products around the blockchain associated with a given cryptocurrency.
 5. Supply: How will supply be controlled? How much of the coin is freely traded? How will it be mined? If supply is very limited and there is a string use case, it may be expected that the coin will increase in value as demand soars.
 After you have considered all the issues outlined above and you still want to proceed with participation in an ICO, here is some guidance.
 Good luck investing! See you at the next ICO.

"4 Things Ugandan Startups Should Know before Looking for Funding
","You can never talk about challenges Ugandan startups face without mentioning the growing scarcity of investment capital coming their way. If we are to go by the released figures by Partech Ventures, Ugandan startups only managed a meager $300,000 in funding for the entire 2016.
 Though some people have come out to disagree with the figure, still we doubt it is anything to match up with its regional neighbors who are floating in tens of millions. For example, Kenyan startups managed $92.7 Million, Tanzanian $12.9 Million and Rwandan $16 Million (you read that right).
 Here are some of the tips from two Ugandan startup founders (SafeBoda and Mandulis Energy) that have raised funding in millions of dollars. Once put into practice, they will help you or any other startup founder in Uganda raise funding for their startup  probably in millions of dollars, too!
 Maxime Dieudonné is a Co-founder and Co-CEO at SafeBoda which is rumored to have raised funding in the region of $1 Million while Peter Nyeko is the co-founder of Mandulis Energy which owns majority of Earth Energy Co. Ltd  the company that secured $993,000 financing from The Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) last year.
 
 
 Have an MVP
 
 
 This comes from Maxime Dieudonné, co-founder SafeBoda. His message is simple;
 As founders, it is important to de-risk the investment as much as possible before engaging investors. Investors will rarely invest in just an idea, therefore it is important to have a proof of concept and ideally having around 100 very engaged customers using the product frequently, Maxime advises.
 He advises that the product should be what is called an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) which is the simplest version of the final product. He also points out that startup founders or owners should try to avoid wasting time making the product look fancy.
 Too often founders try to add a lot of (unnecessary) features to the product which brings complexity and leads to very long development process, he adds.
 2. Pitch (Deck)
 Once you have an MVP with a small group of engaged customers, then embark on writing a beautiful deck highlighting your business model and how big the market is.
 Investors are usually looking for fast growth and highly scalable solutions so it is important to reflect these in a very clear and concise slide deck, advises Maxime.
 There are very many ways one can prepare a pitch deck, though many people have picked interest in the Airbnb pitch deck. You can view it here.
 3. Make use of online resources
 Here, both Maxime and Peter Nyeko strongly agree. Maxime recommends that Ugandan startup founders read The start-up Playbook from YCombinator.
 Peter, is an ardent believer in making the most of online resources. He recommends (sometimes free) courses from various universities in the US and other countries offered on Edex and coursera. You can check some of them here, here, here and here.
 Every strategy that has got us to having a start-up already valued at $40 Million during project development; and which will have raised over $200 Million before the turn of the decade is in those shared resources, Peter.
 What one should expect from the above resources is knowledge and skills in opportunity identification, how to launch a product, its growth, financing and profitability. In some of the cases, learners with the top-scoring projects get introduced to the most appropriate Venture Capital firms.
 4. Network
 This is Pretty obvious to some but the fact its appearing on the list cements its relevance. Lets face it; its people who are going to invest in your startup. But how do you get to those people?
 Peter recommends SheTrades, a web and mobile application that provides women entrepreneurs across the world a unique platform to connect to markets. Its is aiming at connecting one million women to market by 2020.
 There are also various ways for startup founders to network both locally and globally. Take example of twitter chats as well as platforms like Venture Capital for Africa.
 Finally, according to Maxime, passion, perseverance and hustle will make the difference whether investors are willing or not to work with founders.

"Press release: Tony Elumelu Donates $500,000 to Sierra Leone
","Tony Elumelu, Founder of Tony Elumelu Foundation and Chairman of United Bank for Africa (UBA) on, Wednesday 23 August, paid a state visit to the people and Government of Sierra Leone to mourn the loss of lives caused by devastating mudslides and floods that claimed hundreds of innocent lives and left many more still missing.
 Elumelu was in the company of former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo and Sierra Leonean President Ernest Koroma. He visited some of the survivors at the Connaught Hospital in Freetown upon arrival in the country.
 Later on at the Sierra Leonean Statehouse, he made a donation of USD$250,000 on behalf of the Tony Elumelu Foundation and another USD$250,000 on behalf of the staff, management, and Directors of United Bank for Africa (UBA) as emergency aid grants for victims of the mudslides.
 Speaking in solidarity with Sierra Leone, Elumelu charged the world and the African private sector to rally around the ongoing rehabilitation and relief efforts. “For me, the little token we are giving is what it is, little, but symbolic. At a time like this, the world must come together to support the victims of this unfortunate disaster. It is not a situation that one prays to be in, but in the event that it does happen, we should all rally to support one another.”
 Continuing, he urged the rest of the world not to turn a blind eye to Sierra Leone’s plight: “We have on our hands a humanitarian disaster of high proportions. It requires the attention of the entire world. We have buried over 600 lives and many hundreds more are still missing. We must turn the global spotlight on Africa. The world must stand with Africa just as in the past; Africa has stood with the world.”
 The UBA Chairman reassured Sierra Leoneans of the Bank’s steadfast support. “United Bank for Africa (UBA) will continue to play its role in helping small and medium scale enterprises, and women, especially from the affected areas, to enable them to rebuild their economic lives.
 The Sierra Leonean President, moved by this act, commended Elumelu’s unwavering presence in the country’s times of need, stating: “In you, we have a brother and someone we can rely on.” He praised the consistency of the Founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). “You have always provided us with support. United Bank for Africa (UBA) was here immediately after the war to provide us with banking services to support our rebuilding efforts. Again, during our fight against Ebola, you were here through the United Bank for Africa (UBA) and the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) and provided us with great support. And now again, you have come to support us.”
 Elumelu’s donation will support the victims, some of whom are in hospital needing food, clothing, and medicine. The much-needed assistance will also go towards the ongoing recovery efforts and the construction of permanent settlements for the affected persons.
 The Sierra Leonean mudslides are the third catastrophe to devastate the West African country in the past two decades.

"SafeBoda knock-off, Dial Jack, launches in Uganda
","Dial Jack, a SafeBoda knock-off, has today officially launched its operation in the Ugandan market. The Boda-hailing company that describes itself as an aggregator currently has an Android application where one can be able to access their ride services.
 
 This is how the @DialJackUG android app looks like and I’ve tried to search for it on the Apple Store but can’t seem to find it.
 On asking, the Apple version will be out in about two weeks since many users have android. #TechNewsUg #TechUpdates #Transportation #DialJackUg pic.twitter.com/HCP4imkEHo
 — 📷 Payo (@enywaru) June 20, 2018
 In a press release Dial Jack sent out, it refers to itself as the only company offering a hail model for its customers. The company also pointed out personal accident insurance and recognition initiatives such as funding of permit costs as the edge it has over the existing comparison.
 Brenda, the companys social media manager also re-echoed the same message in a conversation we had.
 The company was founded by life and business coach Jacob Mathew, according to Brenda. A twitter account which I suspect belongs to Jacob Mathew tweeted  through Instagram  last year that Dial Jack Coming to Uganda.
 
 Dial Jack Coming soon to Uganda.#biketaxi #future #uganda #bodaboda #boda #startups #startup… https://t.co/Jzi3qHirIz
 — Jacob Mathew (@jdmmbb) October 25, 2017
 No further details were revealed about the investors behind the company and the management. Though, its clear the founder, Jacob, is not Ugandan.
 The company is located on 7th Street Industrial Area in Kampala and, according to Brenda, will be offering rides within a radius of 25kms from the Kampala Central Business District.
 Apart from the ability to schedule a ride for later, theres nothing much that is likely to sway users from the already existing incumbents; SafeBoda, Taxisfy, Mondo, and UberBODA. And, its also worth noting that if the feature proves a success, it wont take much for the incumbents to replicate it in their applications. Think Snapchat stories and Facebook products.
 Also read: Tech hubs in Africa should focus on being what they are, Hubs; research paper recommends
 Dial Jack, in their app, points out that their charge is UGx. 1000 per Kilometre. This makes it more expensive than SafeBoda and Taxify  at the moment  which I have both used in the past one week. For example, from Lumumba Avenue to Kisaasi, I was charged UGx. 2500 (USD. 0.7) with Taxify and UGx. 2000 (USD. 0.5) from Makerere University to Kisaasi with SafeBoda. Both distances are at least 10 kilometers.
 My experience also indicates that both Taxify and SafeBoda are not only cheaper than the rest but have a growing catalog of riders. SafeBoda, says that they boast over 1500 riders in their database. While UberBODA &amp; Taxify havent yet released any statistics ever since they launched their Boda Boda services.
 The process of signing up with Dial Jack is going to be a turnoff for many users. It requires one to fill in some sort of questionnaire. Think of half the questions when you were joining Facebook. A process that could be made easier if they integrated with Google and Facebook to allow one sign up using either.
 The user experience wont also be the best if youre used to using Uber, Taxify, and SafeBoda. Or even Mondo.

"KENNETH LEGESI: How to Rightly Establish the Valuation of Your Ugandan Startup
","For entrepreneurs looking to raise capital for their Ugandan startup or investors seeking to make an investment in a Ugandan startup, a valuation is normally a key negotiating factor.
 How then do you arrive at a valuation for a venture that is pre or slightly posts revenue, with a business model that is not properly defined, has very few assets in a market with limited peers and even more limited data? What is valuable about such a startup and how do you price this.
 As the saying goes, “Price is what you pay, while the value is what you get”, it is important that price and value are aligned as much as possible, even for startups.
 To arrive at a value, broadly there are three methods of company valuation are commonly applied: an Asset approach; an Income approach; and a Comparables approach. Any other specialist methods of valuation are usually a variation on one of these methods.
 The Asset approach focuses on a companys net asset value (NAV), or the fair-market value of its total assets minus its total liabilities, to determine what it would cost to recreate the business.
 The Income approach focuses on the value of a company based on the amount of income or cash flow the company is expected to generate in the future.
 While as the Comparables approach focuses on the value of a company based on similar companies recently bought and sold.
 Yet applying any of these methods in Sub-Saharan Africa in general and Uganda specifically poses challenges and uncertainty because:
 Startups do not possess much in way of assets, they are just building out their assets; any projections of income or cash flow may over or underestimate the business outcomes; with a small and nascent startup ecosystem with limited exits, void of meaningful comparable transactions and with information closely/privately held, comparables are few and far in between; startups are small and illiquid, any valuation would need to take this into account; Startups are evolving and transient not mature and steady going concerns.
 How then should one value a startup in Uganda? The methods identified above, while insightful and instructive, would need to be adjusted to take into account the limitations identified for startups.
 In addition, the industry in which the startup plays, stage in the lifecycle and the reason for the valuation will also influence the method and approach of valuation used. One cannot overstate the importance of records in helping to support any valuation.
 Lets outline the adjustments needed to reflect the unique characteristics of a startup.
 Asset approach
 This would involve identifying what it would cost to recreate the startup today to deliver the product or service being provided including hardware requirements, developer time and inputs, payment for subscriptions and licenses, filing for patents.
 Having determined these costs, which are the assets, any liabilities or debts owed would need to be deducted from the assets to arrive at a net asset value (NAV) and is usually thought of as a base or floor valuation.
 Needless to say, this method does not take into account the potential cash flow that the venture would be able to generate.

 Income approach
 Unlike the asset approach, the income approach takes into account potential income or cash flows. For a technology startup, for example, that uses a subscription model or generates income from transactions, income expected per transaction or per subscriber would be projected into the future against growth in transactions or subscribers.
 From this is derived the net income or cash flow that would accrue to the startup after costs are deducted. This income or cash flow would need to be projected over say a 3 year period.
 Generally, projecting beyond 3-5 years may not be helpful. At year 3, it may be assumed that investors in the company shall be able to sell the business for a given amount, usually a multiple of the money invested, say 3X – 5X.
 The net income or cash flows and the final sale value would need to be discounted to today at the desired return for investors that reflects the startup company’s risk and the prevailing economic conditions, to arrive at a value today.
 Comparables approach
 There is a shortage of comparable transactions in the Ugandan startup market, a basis would be to look to similar startups or businesses in other jurisdictions for which transactions are available and note what value parameters (sales, profits, number of customers/users, number of downloads, customer lifetime value, etc.) and what multiples were applied to these parameters to arrive at a value. For example, Facebook paid $4 per user to arrive at $19 billion valuation for WhatsApp.
 Adjustments
 The valuation arrived at using any of the methods identified above would have to be adjusted upwards (premium) or downwards (discount) to reflect the issues and challenges identified above which can be linked to illiquidity (startups are difficult to sale), size (startups are small), lack of control (depending on the stake one owns) and intangible value (for example patents, brand).
 For each of these factors, the valuation identified would have to be adjusted. Typical adjustments may be for size (say 10%  15% discount);
 
 Illiquidity (say 15%  25% discount).
 Control (say 15%  25% discount or premium depending on whether the valuation is for a minority stake or majority stake respectively).
 Intangibles (this is very subjective and may be reflected in a premium or discount only implied in the purchase price paid).

"This year&#8217;s Kampala Innovation Week to focus on funding
","Last week, The Innovation Village announced the return of Kampala Innovation Week. First organized last year, the week-long event “brings together the various stakeholders to celebrate the innovation efforts in Uganda and the region.”
 This year, Kampala Innovation Week will take place from August 20  24 at The Innovation Village and the various hubs across Kampala. These include Design Hub Kampala and Outbox Hub. Though, Kawanguzi Japheth, the founder of The Innovation Village is hoping to have Hive Colab come on board.
 The theme is “Financing Uganda’s Innovation Ecosystem. This year’s Innovation Week will thus focus on bridging the existing funding gaps. It will also seek to build on last year’s goal of building awareness and linkages.
 “Last year we did the Kampala Innovation Week with the objective of building awareness around the ecosystem and why it is important,” said Japheth. Adding that they “managed to bring in corporates, government representatives, and investors.”
 Also read: These are the Ugandan startups in Hangzhou participating in Alibaba’s eFounders Initiative
 The conversation the entire week will, therefore, center around identifying the available and possible ways to finance the innovation ecosystem.
 Like last year, all the building blocks of the innovation ecosystem will be present. This includes academia, corporates, government, investors and other enablers.
 Some of the key ones include Siemens. “Siemens will be here to share their work with corporate acceleration”, said Japheth. Other partners include the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance, Seedstars and the International Trade Centre.
 “Government ministry is a partner as far as the week is concerned. We will also be with International Trade Centre and also Seedstars in as far as their view of financing ecosystems.”
 Since the event focuses on financing the innovation ecosystem, Japheth says that investors must be present.
 “Everything we are doing is to unlock opportunities for the ecosystem. So, investors will have an opportunity to try to understand ‘where are the opportunities for me to invest?’ Where are the entrepreneurs?’ That’s the interest for anyone that’s investing.”

"SafeBoda driver attacked by other &#8216;regular&#8217; boda-boda drivers in Kampala
","Murphys law seems to be applying to SafeBoda in the recent past. Just when the company is trying to overcome one issue, others pile. Indeed, misery loves company.
 Yesterday, one of the startups drivers was attacked by regular bodas in Kampala. That is according to the passenger the driver was trying to pick up.
 The passenger says that they were both at an airtime stand with the SafeBoda driver. So as [I] go to buy Airtime at this kiosk, I meet this Safeboda guy also buying airtime as he prepares for the new day, he tweeted.
 He decided to take him rather than request, as SafeBoda allows you to pair with a driver nearest request. But as they were doing so, a group of regular boda-boda drivers showed up.
 As we try to Pair the ride, some normal boda guy arrives with some friends of his, and start yelling at him, he added. They said, in Luganda, tetwagala safeboda mukibuga, SafeBoda mukibuga twazigoba. Which translates into we no longer want Safeboda in the city, we chased them away.
 
 Today morning i witnessed how cruel and heartless Ugandans can be due to jealousy and envy.

 He, the passenger, thought that they were goofing around. Yet, this intensified as they grabbed his helmet and shoved him around.
 I actually thought they were just joking around at first. But the guys get real physical and the number mysteriously increases to around 5 guys, all hurling insults and threatening to kill him.
 They, apparently, grabbed the drivers helmet and smashed it on the ground. Though the SafeBoda driver tried fighting back, the group of the regular boda-boda drivers was growing. Now, they were about five.
 Even though the traffic police showed, it was late as, Jonathan, the SafeBoda driver, had already lost his helmet as well as beaten.

 Apparently, the regular boda-boda drivers are growing frustrated because SafeBoda is gaining ground. They allege that SafeBoda drivers earn more on average compared to them.
 The incident in Kampala is not isolated. Uber, the successful pioneer of the model, has had its driver face resistance in the past. This has happened in several markets across Europe and Africa.
 In February 2016, Nairobi Taxi drivers said that Uber was driving them out of business. Thus demanding that it leaves the market. While a Taxify driver was killed in South Africa in March this year. An attack that is suspected to have been staged by the metered taxi drivers.
 Perhaps SafeBoda hadnt received the attacks yet because it was still on a smaller scale. Now that they are significant, they are affecting the take-home for the regular bodas.
 Weve reached out to SafeBoda for a comment and will update as soon as they get back to us.

"Tunga Offers Opportunity to Uganda&#8217;s Freelance Developers
","
 Tunga is a startup that connects African coders to international software projects. It was co-founded by Ernesto Spruyt  a Dutch tech enthusiast.
 
 
  
 
 
 The platform links individuals and companies with projects to available developers and project managers. 
 
 
  
 
 
 They started operation in mid 2015 in Kampala, Uganda. This is a little bit strange given that most people regard Kenya as the technology hub of the region  so one would expect them to consider Nairobi ahead of Kampala. Theyre right. Thats what Ernesto, Tungas Co-founder, wanted to do exactly  at first. 
 
 
  
 
 
 His first thought was to set up shop in Nairobi until he visited Kampala and found out that actually therere talented and enthusiastic software developers in Uganda. What surprised him most was that no one was looking to set up. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Asked if his thought to set up in Kenya was partly influenced by the launch of Andela  in that very period, Ernesto disagreed. 
 
 
 Were speaking to one of the Co-founders of @tunga_io today! Any questions you would like us to ask him? pic.twitter.com/uzs7rvHRP9
 — StartupDigestAfrica (@DigestAfrica) March 22, 2017
 
  Currently, Tunga has over 100 Ugandan developers signed up on its platform  and less than 20 from Kenya. These developers sign up as freelancers and earn an hourly wage depending on how long the project theyre working on takes.
 
  
 
 
 The startup charges 19 Euros per hour per task and 12.5 Euros go to the developer. For project management, 39 Euros per hour is charged and the project manager earns between 20-25 Euros of that depending on their level of expertise.
 
 
  
 
 
 When we asked Ernesto how long, on average, it takes one to join  he told us that its a matter of hours depending on how fast the developer can do their tests. The platform is open to any level of developer as long as theyre able to please the clients.
 
 
  
 
 
 All the work is done remotely and the teams are managed remotely. The developer and project owner use third party tools like Slack, BitBucket etc to keep in touch. Yet, according to Ernesto, theyre working tirelessly to ensure they integrate all these in Tunga.
 
 
  
 
 
 Recently, Tunga agreed to move into the yet to be launched Design Hub Kampala. Though currently, the team is still at Outbox Hub.
 
 
  
 
 
 With Tunga, and the launch of Andela, Ugandan Developer are in for the best. It is upto to them to ensure they make use of these platforms and networks to up their skills. 
 
 Tunga will also give an option to developers who might not be interested in the full time employment which Andela offers given that one has the power to choose when and where they want to work from.
 
 
  
 
 
 This means Tunga has to compete with the already existing Freelance websites like PeoplePerHour which some Ugandan developers have been using to find gigs.

"EWB Ventures sets up shop in Kampala, to invest up to $100,000
","EWB Ventures, the impact investing arm of the Canadian not for profit Engineers Without Borders, is growing its presence in Kampala.
 This was confirmed by Kawanguzi Japheth, the founder of The Innovation Village, where EWB Ventures set up its new Uganda office. “They’ve already set up actually,” Japheth told me.
 Founded in 2013, the seed-stage impact investing vehicle has had a team on the ground for years but has now moved into the co-sharing wing of the Innovation Village.
 This, according to Japheth, will ensure they keep in constant contact with the very entrepreneurs they are looking to invest in.
 “They’ll be seated right in the co-sharing space where we have other entrepreneurs. [These are] the entrepreneurs they (EWB Ventures) are really looking to invest in” – Japheth.
 Being seed-stage means that EWB Ventures comes in very early in a startup’s life. Something Japheth believes is an important addition to Kampala’s entrepreneurship ecosystem.
 “I think [they] are unique from other investors that have come across [the innovation village],” he pointed out. Adding that it is “because they look at coming in really really really early.”
 Also read: Edtech startup, Fundi Bots, has secured additional funding
 When I interviewed Rithu Rajan from EWB Ventures last year, she told me that the company has been investing between $10,000 to $100,000 in early-stage ventures across Kenya, Uganda, Ghana and other sub-Saharan countries.
 According to Japheth, they are doing the same for the Ugandan market. “So they want to come in early before Growth stage investors are speaking of coming in,” he said. Adding that “they [will] invest up to $100,000” and help position the company to successfully raise later rounds of capital. t. EWB Ventures invests in startups that have highly scalable and innovative approaches to serving the bottom of the pyramid. They currently only invest in Uganda, Kenya, and Ghana.
 During the interview with Rithu, who has since left the fund, she also informed me that they had so far made 9 investments in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda’s Numida, Ghana’s Bloom Impact, and Kenya’s M-Shule and Farm Drive.
 Asked if they have identified any startups to invest in at The Innovation Village, Japheth said no. Pointing out that what attracted them was the “philosophy”.
 “I think it is the philosophy that brings them rather than if they have some startups they have spotted,” said Japheth. Adding that they both have a “common mindset of coming in early to support entrepreneurs who have scalable ventures.”
 Currently, EWB Canada has a large presence in Uganda and the Ventures team has recently added two people in Uganda, Brittney Dudar and Beth Foster. You can contact EWB Ventures at investments@ewb.ca.
 Note:
 This article has been updated to reflect certain changes that have taken place at EWB. Additionally, it was reported that EWB is just setting up in Uganda. However, the team clarified that they have always had operations in the country.

"Takuma&#8217;s Leapfrog Ventures invests $50,000 in Kenya&#8217;s BiasharaBot
","Leapfrog Ventures has made a $50,000 investment into Kenyas SaaS startup BiasharaBot. This is according to reports from The Bridge [in Japanese].
 Leapfrog Ventures announced that it has invested $ 50,000 in Biashara Viral Gains, which develops sales management SaaS BiasharaBot that delivers products from sellers to consumers based on social commerce, wrote The Bridge.
 Founded in 2017 by Moses Kibet Korir and Felix Cheruiyot, BiasharaBot describes itself as a startup that helps clients side business thrive by using an AI-powered bot [to] handle enquires, close sales and receive payments.
 We provide a dashboard where users can easily add their brand, manage inventory and track sales. BiasharaBot can be used for food order &amp; delivery and E-Commerce firms.
 According to The Bridge, BiasharaBot will use the funds to work on a plug-in for various e-commerce platforms.
 Biashara plans to release and release a plug-in for e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, Woo Commerce, Magento, and others around 3 months after, a translated version reads.
 Additionally, they are looking to increase their number of clients to 1000 stores, though they did not state their current number. Beyond that, the startup hinted on an interest in expanding into South Africa as well as the Nigerian markets.

 Along with expanding services in Kenya, I am willing to expand into the population of Nigeria and South Africa, especially in the Sub-Saharan Africa market in the future, wrote The Bridge.
 BiasharaBot has before participated in the Pangea accelerator in April this year where they also secured $50,000 afterward. So, this recent investment from Leapfrog Ventures becomes their second in less than six months.
 For Takumo, this is the second deal he is making in less than 6 months after setting up Leapfrog Ventures in Africa. His first was a $50,000 investment in Rwanda-based Exuus.
 Leapfrog ventures was set up as a joint effort between Takuma and Tokyo-based startup incubator Samurai Incubate  where he previously worked. The fund is worth $4.5 Million and looking to invest in at least 80 startups across Africa.
 The target markets are Rwanda [where he is based], Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and South Africa.
 Last week, he was in Kampala, Uganda for the Kampala Innovation Week where he is believed to have picked interest in at least two fintech startups. These he is going to write cheques in the regions of between $50,000 to $100,000.
 The conversations are said to be in final stages and we have reached out to him to get further details on the Ugandan deals.

"TooGood wants to fill the gap left by Done Deal as &#8216;Groupon for Uganda&#8217;
","Theres a discount void in Uganda, and TooGood wants to fill it. In April 2016, Eat Out Kenya  an online food and menu curation platform   acquired Ugandas Done Deal for an undisclosed amount.
 However, two years later, there was not an active and up-to-date discount platform in the country. Thats why this team of 9 decided to launch one early this year.
 After the acquisition of done deal by Eat Out, the deal site market in Uganda was left with no major player, the team says. Adding that they had the experience, the knowledge and the resources to start.
 They also acknowledged the inspiration from Groupon. We can not rule out the Groupon inspiration, we are keen followers of what they do.
 TooGood, a discounts aggregator, launched in May this year with the aim of helping shoppers save money. At TooGood, we believe that every shopping outing should be an opportunity to save money for another outing, wrote Nathan Ssenyondo, the MD.
 Located at Hive Colab in Kamwokya, TooGood is a team of 9. These boast of previous experience from being a part of Done Deal as well as Sukuma online.
 
 The entire management team running Too Good was part of a successful startup/ deal site/discount site called Done Deal Uganda that was acquired in 2016 by Eat Out Kenya, a venture specializing in restaurant reservations, Nathan wrote.
 
 Adding that after this acquisition, we started our first company called Sukuma Online in July 2016, a digital marketing company offering 360 digital marketing solutions to small, medium and big businesses in Uganda and East Africa.
 Among the notable team members are Alex Ssenoga (CEO), Kapeyi Samson (CTO), as well as Nathan himself as the MD.
 All the three were part of Done Deal. Alex as the Systems administrator and head of digital marketing, Nathan worked as the head of sales and merchant relations while Samson as the lead developer.
 No external funding has been raised by the team yet, though are currently on the lookout. We have not raised funding yet but looking to raise our first round of USD 100K, Nathan wrote.
 Also read: Kilimall has completely shut down its Ugandan business
 But, they launched with their own funds estimated at $15,000 (UGx. 50 million) and so far, have been able to sign up at least 94 merchants. With a target of hitting 1000 in the next 12 months.
 Our target is to have 1000 Merchants listed and offering deals within 1 year from now, Nathan wrote.
 Their current process of uploading the deals is manual and largely done by the TooGood team itself. If they are to scale to 1000 merchants, then a lot of work has to be done to automate the process as well as onboard the merchants on how to do it on their own.
 When it comes to the Busines model, they are currently looking at two avenues of generating revenue; advertising and commission.
 We charge a commission from merchants for every order generated through TooGood website [and also charge] an advertising fee from corporate companies that want to advertise on the website but not necessarily offering deals, Nathan wrote.
 Though, my issue is around the margins when it comes to the commission. Youd have to generate a significant amount of sales revenue for a merchant, to negotiate favorable rates. But, there are already existing and established segment verticals like Jumia Food who are able to do this.
 Additionally, I dont see any upper-hand for TooGood when it comes to advertising. It is not like they have niche visitors. This puts them in direct competition with Google as well as Facebook and you know who wins here, always.
 Although they dont have a direct competitor, there are a couple of existing players in other segments who  when compounded  are a big challenge for TooGood. This includes all Jumia ventures (Food, Mall, and Travel).
 One of the selling points for all of the Jumia ventures is the discounts they regularly offer. Additionally, it is likely that at least the biggest chunk of what TooGood is offering can be found on one of Jumias platforms. The other notable competitors are Coupon Book  which an app  and Eat Out.
 All in all, TooGood is a much-needed and exciting platform with the potential to exit through an acquisition by a more established e-commerce company or one thats looking to enter the market.

"There are 442 active tech hubs in Africa, GSMA 2018 report
","GSMA, an association that represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, has today [20/03/2018] released its annual Tech Landscape report for 2018. According to the report, there are now 442 active tech hubs in Africa. This represents a 41% jump from last years estimate of 314 tech hubs.
 South Africa maintained the lead with 59 hubs up from 54 indicated in last years report. However, Nigeria is fast closing the gap. The number of tech hubs in Nigeria jumped from 23 to 55 by close of 2016 and 2017 respectively. To sum up the top 5, Egypt, Kenya and Morocco each clocked 33, 30 and 25 tech hubs respectively.
 According to GSMA, a tech hub is a physical spaces designed to foster and support tech start-ups”. They adopted this definition in 2016 when they first carried out research on this topic. The definition covers incubators, accelerators, co-working spaces, fab labs, maker spaces, hackerspaces, and other innovation centres.

 — Digest Africa (@DigestAfrica) March 20, 2018
 Growth has been registered across almost all countries on the continent where the study was carried out.
 In Africa, countries like Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, for instance, have experienced a significant growth in the number of active tech hubs over the past year, wrote Maxime Bayen from GSMA. Adding that since 2016, the Ghanaian ecosystem – home to hubs such as MEST and iSpace – has grown by 50% (from 16 to 24).
 Similarly, Abidjan in Cote d’Ivoire has gradually positioned itself as the new catalyst of innovation across Francophone Africa and has seen its number of active tech hubs double. Zimbabwe (13) and Uganda (20) led the way in ‘tier 2’ ecosystems in Southern and East Africa respectively.

 Also important to note is that Lagos has now taken over as the leading ecosystem city in Africa with 31 active tech hubs.
 Lagos has now taken over as the African city with the highest number of tech hubs (31) and potentially the leading innovation hub on the continent, especially after MEST, Google and Facebook announced the opening of local tech hubs between 2017 and 2018, says Maxime.
 However, some cities are also evolving at a fast rate. For example, Accra has now broken into the top five ecosystem cities in Africa with over 16 tech hubs.
 Over the past two years, secondary ecosystem cities have also caught some light, denoting the growth of the national tech scenes outside of the main economic hub, Maxime wrote. Adding that, Cities like Johannesburg, Kumasi, and Alexandria in Africa, and Hanoi, Penang, Ahmedabad, Bandung in Asia Pacific, are now established ecosystem cities in their respective markets.
 Although the African tech startup scene has attracted interest from investors and multinational corporations like Google, Microsoft, Alibaba and Facebook, telecoms are still at the centre of supporting the tech hubs.
 The last couple of years have also been characterised by the rise of tech giants’ interest in the untapped opportunities of African markets, write Maxime. Yet, according to the report, about 12% of the active [tech] hubs [in Africa] are now either run or backed by a local mobile operator.
 MTN, Vodacom, and Orange appear as the most active operators in Africa when it comes to running or engaging with local tech hubs. Though, Econets Liquid Telecom is likely to become a top contender given the partnerships it is setting up.

"Nigerian startups raised at least $117M in the first 3 quarters of 2018
","Techpoint has published its Nigerian startup funding report for Q3 2018. The report indicates that Nigerian startups raised around $35.5 million in funding in Q3, which is less than 50% of the amount raised in Q2.
 But, the figure brings the total amount of funding in the first three quarters of 2018 to at least $117 million according to the previous reports by Techpoint.
 In Q1, the media company reported that Nigerian startups had raised $9.2 million while $73.6 million in Q2. It should be noted that Cellulant, which raised $47.5 million, contributed to more than a half of the funding raised in Q2.
 Fintechs dominated Q2 and Q3 with the notable rounds including Cellulant, Paga, Mines, and Paystack. In Q1, the number of startups that raised funding was 14, which tripled to 41 in Q2 and dropped to 37 in Q3.
 Theres also a significant amount of grant funding in the ecosystem. In Q1, 5.3% of the total funding came from grants, a figure which more than doubled to 14% in Q2. Yet, this significantly dropped to under 0.5% in Q3. Though, grants contributed an approximated 9% to the total funding raised in the three quarters.
 Early this year, Village Capital released a report which indicated that 80% of disclosed investors in Africa in 2017 were foreigners.
 According to Techpoints reports since the beginning of the year, this hasnt changed in Nigeria. In Q3, almost all the funding raised came from foreign investors.
 Recently, I have been skeptical when it comes to referring to startups as African. Instead, I refer to most as startups in Africa.
 Part of my skepticism stems from the fact that it is hard to establish a startups origins. To me, a startup belongs to a certain country either when they have headquarters there or registered the parent company there.
 But, many startups arent transparent enough to understand their parent company registration details.
 Also read: These are Africa’s top 17 funding rounds in 2018 (so far)
 But, I asked Yinka Awosanya  in charge of the reports  the methodology they used. According to them, a Nigerian startup is a company founded in the country and also serving the country. He also added that the said company or startup can also be operating elsewhere.
 When it comes to data collection, Yinka says that it is done in real-time. As stated in the report, the data used in the report is collected in real time as funding activities were announced, he said. Adding that theres also a form for people to inform us of funding activities, anonymously.
 Beyond that, they also had to reach to some investors to get details of funding activities.
 Reports on startup funding across Africa have largely been inconsistent in the past two years. The most widely referenced being Disrupt Africas as well as Partech Ventures. Yet, while as the latters methodology is clear, Disrupt Africas hasnt been able to publish theirs.
 In turn, many are left to quote different figures depending on their motive. For instance, while as Partech reported that over $550 million was raised, Disrupt Africa reported just under $200 million.
 It is key that certain definitions and key terms are either standardized or stated outright. That can be in form of a methodology so that whoever is using the report can know its limitations.
 In the case of the Techpoint report, one could easily classify Cellulant as a Kenyan company. That is basing on where its headquarter is, despite having operations in Nigeria.

"Africa&#8217;s 50 most funded tech companies in 2018 raised a total of $618M
","This Thursday, we shall release the Digest Africa INDEX, an annual report that summarises Africas technology investment landscape. As a build-up to the day, we shall release snippets of what is contained in the report. In this article, we look at the 50 most funded tech companies in Africa in the past year.
 Throughout 2018, we tracked 454 funding and M&amp;A deals of which 344 were disclosed. These generated $1.19 billion in deal value with funding raised by tech companies contributing 57% of that.
 However, the 50 most funded companies in 2018  with $618 million  contributed 90% of the $686.4 million total funding. The most funded company on the list is Tanzanias Zola Electric with $107.5 million. Please note that when recording funding, we include debt financing, grants/non-equity assistance, venture capital, angel investment, initial coin offerings, crowdfunding and corporate financing.
 Also read: These are the 50 African startups to watch in 2019
 For this particular list, we only included companies that raised at least $2 million in total funding. That is why the number of total companies on the infographic is 51 because there were multiple companies with $2 million in total funding raised.
 On the infographic, the companies are classified under four groupings; $2-4.99M, $5-9.99M, $10-19.99M and $20M+. There were seven companies that raised $20 million plus with an aggregate total of $346 million. From $10 million to $20 million, there were 9 companies with an aggregate amount of $111 million.
 Zola Electric was the most funded company with $107.5 million.
 Please note that a couple of deals that others could have included on this list are missing partly because of our methodology or because they were classified under M&amp;A. For example, we put Webuycars $94 million under M&amp;A.
 At Digest Africa, we only focus on for-profit technology (and innovative) companies across Africa. Although we may once in a while write about non-tech companies  like Cipla QCLs IPO in 2018  we do not include them in our reports. Thats why we never included Africa Leadership Academy ($30.8M), iSON Xperiences ($51.0M) and Alten Africa ($36.0M).
 Additionally, we only focus on companies that are headquartered in Africa. If they are not, then they should have Africa as either their primary or only market. That is why funding raised by companies; Branch ($20.0M), Tala ($65.0M) and D.Light ($116.0M), wasnt included.
 Update: We adjusted the total funding raised from $684 million to $686.4 million after some of the companies we had reached out to earlier confirmed raising funding. This also took the total number of deals to 454 from 448 as we had earlier written here.

"What African Parents Should Do If We Are to Raise More Innovative Children
","A quick story
 Last week, I held an interview with a gentleman. I intentionally turned his chair so that it could face the direction of sun rays that were permeating my office window.
 To my surprise, he also just sat on the chair and accepted to be interrupted by the sun rays throughout the interview.
 At the end of the interview, when I asked him why he hadnt switched the direction of the chair to make sure it was comfortable for him. Which in turn would help him perform better in the interview since hed be at ease?
 He replied that because thats how I found it. I thought thats how you wanted it. Absolute bullshit.
 Now, lets go
 Often times, African parents get to interact with their children when theyre in a rush or tired. I mean lets review a timetable for a parent, especially in an economy like Uganda (where I reside).
 You wake up at around 6 am and prepare for work. At the same time, your kid(s) wake(s) up but both you and the kid are in a rush to work and school respectively.
 If you own a car, then you sit the kid either at the back or in front and off you go. As you drive to the kids school, you switch on your favorite morning radio show.
 When the kid tries to ask questions, you either shut them up or try to answer haphazardly. Not giving them a comprehensive answer and attention.
 The above is repeated in the evening  for an African parent that picks up their kids themselves.
 For those who dont, you get back home from work at around 8 pm  partly due to the traffic jam. Then dump your bag on your couch/sofa and grab the remote to watch NTV at 9 or NBS  whatever works for you.
 If the kid isnt yet asleep, you remind them that it is late  they should get ready. Any form of questioning or curiosity is subjected to similar responses of shut up or vague responses.
 This is repeated over and over and over again. And people ask how we should be able to churn out innovative men and women when curiosity is trampled on by the very men and women supposed to be nurturing and upholding it?
 An African parent needs to realize they play a significant role in whether their kids will turn out innovative and rebellious or just docile sheep that will be led to the slaughterhouse any time and day.
 If we continue with this routine, we shall continue churning out kids that date people they dont love, do jobs they dont like, are comfortable being mediocre and believe their skin or gender is inferior to the other.
 On the contrary, if were to change and start churning out rebels and innovators, we need to change the approach. We need to pay more attention to our children.
 Lets encourage them to question our decisions. Tell them that it is not okay to accept something that is not ok. Let them question the status quo.
 Even though you settled for far less than you wanted, tell them you made a mistake. Lets stop hiding under the rotten blanket of African Culture.
 Other than that, lets stop talking about innovation instead debate how we can be better slaves to the innovative countries and economies.

"Technology, not Agriculture, is the future for Uganda &#8211; Patrick Bitature
","Last night [12/01/2018], Ugandan businessman, Patrick Bitature visited entrepreneurs at the Innovation Village in Ntinda. Bitature was invited by the Lead of the Innovation Village, CK Japheth, to kick-start the year for the hub, its occupants and other interested entrepreneurs.
 This was after he read about Patricks letter in the New Vision emphasizing the importance of persistence and tenacity when venturing into entrepreneurship.
 
 If you are still wondering how to make your mark this year. @patrickbitature thoughts in @newvisionwire will be a big help.
 Hard times serve to remind us that there is no substance for persistence. It takes time to build dreams  but we must keep at it. pic.twitter.com/ahI6SsBghN
 — CK Japheth (@CKJapheth) January 2, 2018
 
 With an estimated audience of over 100 youths all attentive, Bitature narrated his challenges before and after starting the Simba Group. The notable ones being where he lost money in millions of dollars as well as when he couldnt or found it hard to secure financing from banks for new ventures.
 For example, when he was required by MTN to open 20 shops in one day if he was to supply their airtime. He also talked about working with Vodacom in Tanzania where the employees of Vodacom connived with his to swindle around $1,000,000. He would later face the same challenge in Nigeria, where what seemed to be a healthy company lost all the working capital to employee swindling.
 Some of the youths that attended the session. [Photo: @Kakatshozi]His message was mixed with motivational and best business practices as well as habits entrepreneurs should embrace to ensure they realize their dreams.
 After his speech, a Q&amp;A followed where he took several questions from the enthusiastic youths. Many asked questions surrounding how he was able to achieve the kind of success he has to date. To which he recommended financial literacy, a reading culture and remaining focused.
 However, while answering one of the questions, Patrick emphasized the importance of technology in Ugandas future. He explained that while as agriculture can employee majority of the population, it is technology that Uganda should bet. Something that resonated well with the audience.
 He also pointed out that while as some people will say that Kenya and Rwanda are ahead of us, I think none will benefit [from technology] if they use or work on it alone. Before advising that we need to come together as a bloc to reap maximum benefits.
 Last year, the Innovation Village saw a couple of high profile government and political figures pay a visit. These included Hon. Frank Tumwebaze, Rt. Hon. Rebecca Kadaga, Hon. Kyagulanyi Bobi Wine Ssentamu and many more. (See also: What can I do for you? Speaker Rebecca Kadaga asks Innovators and the 10 Moments Plus 1 that defined The Innovation Village Kampala in 2017).

"Liquid Telecom releases report on &#8220;the generation that will define Africa’s digital future&#8221;
","Liquid Telecom has released a report on the African Generation Z. The report calls the generation the one that will define Africa’s digital future. Generation Z is the group born between 1995 and the early 2000s.
 The report focuses on the opportunities and challenges awaiting the digital native generation. The African Generation Z Report 2018 takes an in-depth look at how Gen Z could shape business and innovation in Africa in the years to come, the report says.
 It gives an explanation of how Generation Z will consume digital services to analysing what new digital skills will be critical in the not-so-distant future.
 Generation Z, often called the Digital Natives, are the only generation to have grown up with the internet. This has made the internet not just a part of their life  but their life.
 When asked to comment about technology, 21-year-Old Gift from Johannesburg said; Technology is almost everything to almost everyone, these days.
 Also read: 6 key reports that’ll give you a snapshot of the African startup and tech ecosystem
 He is not alone. Dominique, 22 years from Johannesburg, South Africa also said the same thing. Technology plays a big role in my life. You use it for everything these days, you can’t leave home without your phone, or some kind of device. Even just to wake up in the morning, you need your alarm, says Dominique.
 Apart from that, the internet presents a huge opportunity for the generation. From pursuing careers to starting up businesses, the generation has so far tried to make the best of their digital native status.
 Amadou Daffe, CEO and Co-Founder of Gebeya, says that Africa has been playing catch-up with the world when it comes to traditional industries. Yet, software development and technology offers the lowest barrier of entry for Africa to compete  all you need is a laptop, a brain and Wi-Fi.
 Generation Z, together with Millenials have been accused of impatience and independence by the older generations. But, thanks to impatience and the love for independence, the generation is exploring unconventional careers especially technology related.
 
 This generation is impatient and dynamic, they adapt to change easily,” said Oswald Jumira, Head of Innovation Partnerships, Liquid Telecom.
 
 They are also looking to tread in waters deeper than the previous generations. Firstly [sic], they are good at thinking across borders, says Nkosi Ncube, Head of Application Lab at i2i. Adding that the entrepreneurs [that came] before [them] used to think within their own borders, but this generation thinks big .
 Despite all the opportunities, the report warns and highlights the key challenges they must overcome. Approximately 20% of Africa’s population is aged between 15 and 24, marking the region as the youngest in the world, part of the report read.
 This age group, however, are hit the hardest when it comes unemployment and underemployment.
 With the internet eliminating borders and becoming their life, the group also has to deal with another critical issue; loss of identity and the struggle to fit into a life dictated by the internet.
 Technology adds so much extra pressure and stress to everyday life and can help to make all new insecurities or encourage the old ones to get worse, noted 21-year-old Lindwire from Johannesburg, South Africa.
 Though Generation Z are called digital natives, the report indicates that not all are. Millions have not had the opportunity to grow up with the internet like their counterparts in the developed world. Noting that Africa’s Gen Z is a disparate group.
 
 While the developed world’s Gen Z has typically grown up in a digital environment, millions of youth across Africa have yet to experience the basics such as reliable electricity, adequate sanitation, dependable education and digital technology.
 
 With an internet penetration thats far below the global average, millions of Generation Z cant afford to call themselves digital natives. In Africa, where the average internet penetration is around 21%, the average penetration among youths aged 15-24 is around 40%, the report says.
 Adding that, therefore one of the key differentiators between Millennials and Gen Z – growing up as a ‘digital native’ – does not apply to millions of African youth.

"How Ethiopia-based Apposit became Paga&#8217;s technology provider
","At the beginning of September 2018, Paga  a payments company in Nigeria  announced that it had closed a $10 million Series B Extended. Not only did the news create excitement in Paga, but also amongst a few individuals from the Ethiopian tech ecosystem. This is because Apposit, an IT firm started by Adam Abate, Eric Chijioke and Simon Solomon in 2007, is behind Paga’s technology.
 I got to know about Apposit from an African Tech Roundup episode that featured Amadou Daffe [SoundCloud link]. Daffe pointed out that the little-known tech firm was responsible for both the development and maintenance of Paga’s tech.
 In a Zoom call with Adam, who currently serves as Apposit’s CEO, he walked me through their journey.
 The Start
 In 2003, Adam, Eric, and Simon worked on a project for the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance. They built from scratch what was to become the public financial management systems of the country.
 According to Adam, this experience opened their eyes to the need in the market for high-quality engineering talent. Especially one with the ability to build systems appropriate to the African context.
 Over 5 years later, the three  Adam, Eric, and Simon  decided to come together once again. In 2008, they formed Apposit. Their end goal was a company that can not only solve the problems in Ethiopia but also on a large scale across the continent.
 Also read: Victor Asemota to lead VC firm Alta Global Ventures’s business in Africa
 Combined, Apposit founders have extensive experience and knowledge in the IT field.
 Adam Abate himself states on his LinkedIn that he is an “IT professional with over 20 years of experience in developing, implementing and managing large scale information system projects”. He started his career at Accenture (previously Andersen Consulting) and has worked for Fortune 100 clients including DuPont, Siebel Systems, and Ocean Spray Cranberries.
 Prior to founding Apposit, Adam also served as Director of Information Technology for the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, where he managed the development and implementation of a nationwide integrated financial management system for public finance in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development in Ethiopia.
 Eric too has over 20 years of experience in product development and software product management. Eric has designed and managed the implementation of mid to large-scale risk management software systems for clients in the private financial and energy sectors, as well as several similar system development projects for agencies of the World Bank.
 He also served as the Lead Systems Architect developing a nationwide, integrated financial management system (IFMIS) for public finance in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development in Ethiopia. Currently, Eric also serves as the CTO for Paga beyond being the director at Apposit. When asked if this doesn’t cause any conflict of interest between the two, Adam says no.
 While Simon has over 22 years of experience in the IT field with a specialization in complex middleware applications development. He has worked for Nortel Networks and Federated Systems Group in the US as a leading member of their architecture group and as the Lead Software Developer for Harvard University building an integrated financial management system for the Ministry of Finance in Ethiopia.
 The relationship with Paga
 Both Apposit and Paga connected in their early stages in 2009. The relationship started off with Apposit in an advisory role. They helped Paga in the selection and specification of a system from potential vendors.
 But, Tayo Oviosu and Eric Chijioke soon found out, that to do what they wanted to do would need so much customization of an existing product. They thus they decided that it would be better for Paga to build their platform themselves.
 “That has always been one of the best decisions made,” says Adam. because it has allowed Paga to innovate, be nimble and remain in complete control,” he added.
 This prompted the Paga team to look inwards. One of the options they had on the table was Apposit, whom they already had a working relationship with. So they decided to give them a shot.
 Apposit was thus tasked with designing, building and maintaining what was to become Paga’s payments platform. Since then, the relationship between the two hasn’t turned back.
 In fact, as pointed out above, Eric Chijioke has, on top of being a co-founder at Apposit, also served as the CTO at Paga since 2011. Additionally, Apposit is also an investor in Paga. Something Adam thinks has resulted in a strong alignment of purpose and vision.
 When Paga raised funding, Tayo pointed out that they were looking at expanding to other countries, Ethiopia included. This definitely calls for stepping up their technological infrastructure and manpower.
 Currently, according to Adam, Apposit has around 30 developers dedicated to serving Paga. Though this is likely to change as Paga’s needs change. Paga is looking at developing more distributed teams across the continent as well as other parts of the world where they are looking to operate.
 Other activities
 Although Apposit is now getting known for a client whose relationship is about to clock a decade, in that time they have serviced a wide array of clients.
 Some of these include Technoserve. On their website, the firm says that they have worked with them on a Coffee Initiative financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.”
 They have also worked with BGI, a “leading brewery in Ethiopia with thousands of sales outlets all over the country”. Others include Marie Stopes, the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, Tearfund, Zemen Bank, Johns Hopkins University, and more.
 Today, Apposit’s work, aside from what they do with Paga, is focused on two main areas  agriculture and FMCG retail and distribution. In both these areas, they apply technology to improve operations, efficiencies and data management.
 The future
 When asked if they will be looking to scale across the continent anytime soon, Adam says that a pan African vision was always their intention. But, Ethiopia itself still offers many untapped opportunities. Though they are doing their work with the continent at the back of their mind.
 “A pan-African vision is a key criterion for any product we design today and going forward,” Adam said.
 Contribution to the ecosystem
 The Ethiopian startup ecosystem is having exciting activities happening. A few weeks ago, the Ministry of Health announced an initiative to deliver health products using drones.
 While iCog Labs was part of the team that developed Sophia, the now famous humanoid robot. Last year, on her tour, she visited the horn of Africa country. While Gebeya is also establishing itself as a marketplace for software talent.
 Yet, like any emerging ecosystem, a lot still needs to be done. Normally, startups or individuals that have achieved a significant level of success give back to the same ecosystem. When asked if they have been able to do that, Adam admitted that they would like to do more.

"Company LinkedIn pages now carry CrunchBase insights
","Last month, LinkedIn announced a new outlook for company LinkedIn pages on the platform. According to LinkedIn, they rebuild the pages from the ground up.
 The aim was to make it easier for brands, institutions and organizations to foster meaningful conversations.
 Among the changes introduced was linking company pages with CrunchBase insights.
 As part of the relaunch, we’ve worked closely with CrunchBase, the company pointed out. They integrated the relevant funding insights and key investor information directly within a company’s LinkedIn Page.
 
 Now, LinkedIn members will be able to see Crunchbase insights directly on the LinkedIn Page for any company that has an active Crunchbase profile, providing members with quick access to a more complete company profile in one location.
 
 For long, LinkedIn has been one of the primary sources of information about companies.
 But, this hasnt always been enough. One could only find the year of founding, employees size, location and the description. With this integration, there will be information about a companys funding history.
 For job seekers, knowing funding information can help validate interest in a company as an employer. Sales and business professionals can also get a snapshot of a company’s trajectory to better prepare for any upcoming meetings or discussions.
 CrunchBase Insights will appear on the right side of the companys about section.
 Currently, the redesign is only available to a limited group, but the company is planning to roll it out completely in the next 12 months.
 We are rolling out this integration to members with their settings set to English starting on the desktop over the next few weeks, and will be expanding both globally and to mobile in early 2019.

 VALR co-founder and CEO Farzam Ehsani told CoinDesk that 1,500 users, predominantly South Africans, have already signed up on the exchange’s waiting list and started activating accounts in a closed beta leading up the to launch.
 Ehsani said a backend partnership with Bittrex will offer the new exchange global liquidity and competitive prices for crypto-to-crypto trading, while his team works on activating fiat on-ramps with South African banks by summertime.

"Over a dozen African countries have reached out to us &#8211; Andela CEO
","Last week, Jason Calacanis, the host of This Week in Startups Podcast and Managing Partner at Launch, interviewed [YouTube] Jeremy Jason, Andela CEO. The conversation revolved around demystifying the myths about Africa. Many of these painted by US media have painted. The two also talked about the potential that the continent holds.
 Now in its fourth year since founding, Andela has expanded to 4 countries in Africa. That is Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria. But, according to Jeremy, the interest in the companys activities is increasing.
 Are you at a point where these cities are willing to pay you to build out offices and talent? Jason asked the Andela CEO. To which Jeremy replied; It certainly wasnt part of our original thinking.
 Adding; Over the past year, we have had well over a dozen countries reach out and say what would it take to get you to bring Andela to the country?
 Though only operational in four countries, Andela receives applications from other countries.
 Weve had thousands and thousands of applicants from the 50 countries across the continent that we dont operate in, said Jeremy.
 
 For instance, we have had a handful of applicants from Uganda that got into Andela Kenya before Uganda opened. We have [also] had some folks from Togo as well as Ghana get into Andela Nigeria.
 
 Yet, this move faced challenges  especially obtaining work visas for the developers. This prompted them to partner with Rwanda.
 Our first actual government partnership is with Rwanda, Jason said. With the partnership, all developers from countries where Andela isnt operational can get work visas in Rwanda.
 Rwanda said, we want you to build a pan African hub here and we will make it so that anyone that can get into Andela immediately can have a work permit in Rwanda, said Jeremy.
 Last month, while at the TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco event, Fope Adelowo, Ken Njoroge and Tayo Oviosu tackled the issue of lack of exit history in Africa. The trio instead advised that Silicon Valley should bet on Africas potential rather than exit history.
 Jason, like most Silicon Valley investors, was also curious and asked about why he and others should pick interest in the continent. His concerns were around the fact that there hasnt been a unicorn or high profile tech company come out of the continent.
 But, Jeremy advised him to take an example of markets like Australia and Sweden 10 years ago.
 If I were a prolific angel investor right now, I would be very actively looking at Africa as a place for investment, he pointed out. Adding that he would be looking at Andela developers as future technical founders.
 Talking about the journey so far, Jeremy said that the company is growing very fast. We are certainly into the 10s [of millions of dollars in revenue] at this point and more than doubling year over year. Fast forward 5 years, we will be in 10s of thousands of Andelans

"Chinese Crypto-billionaire founder of Binance visits Uganda
","Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese crypto-billionaire has today concluded his visit to Uganda. The founder of Binance, a crypto exchange platform jetted into Uganda over the weekend.
 The purpose of his visit was to create hype around the up-coming African Blockchain Conference that he will be a part of. He also met some high profile people in Uganda’s government as well as the key people building Uganda’s still nascent blockchain scene.
 Among the government officials that he held a meeting with is Uganda’s prime minister, Ruhakana Rugunda. It is anticipated that their meeting centered around making Uganda a first-mover when it comes to blockchain adoption.
 He later met a team of around 20 blockchain enthusiasts for a 2-hour session at the offices of Blockchain Technologies at Nakawa Business Park. Here, CZ answered all questions about his company, Binance, the future of crypto in Uganda and Africa as well as the regulatory issues surrounding the currencies.
 Commenting about regulation, he said that “any country shutting down crypto actually encourages crypto.” Adding that “one countrys decision doesnt affect the adoption of cryptocurrency” when asked about how the Chinese government’s decision to ban crypto-trading affected Binance.
 Though he admitted that “regulation is very important for this [crypto] industry but good regulation”. Pointing out that “there are bad actors in the [crypto] industry and need to be punished.”
 “However, if you over-regulate, you’re going to kill it,” he added.
 Being his first trip to Africa, CZ confessed that he was impressed with what was happening in Uganda around the adoption of blockchain. But also  together with Helen Haiyu, the head of Binance Foundation, encouraged the Ugandan community not to become complacent. This way, the two emphasized, Uganda would lose the advantage of being a first mover.
 “You guys are going to be the early adopters of this technology. It is now your opportunity to educate other people,” CZ said.
 The four woman and man delegation also comprised of the head of Binance Foundation and Binance Labs who both pledged to work with the Ugandan blockchain community.
 Founded last year, CZ saw Binance eclipse from nothing to becoming the world’s biggest crypto exchange in the world.
 In February this year, Forbes wrote that “seven months ago Binance didnt exist. Since then, its 1.4 million-transactions-per-second capability have attracted 6 million users, making it the worlds largest crypto-exchange.”
 However, CZ  in his speech today, said that “I have been in exchanges for 20 years”. Though, to many, he says “it looks like it took us 6 months to go from zero to the biggest [crypto exchange platform]. But for me, it was 20 years.”
 Forbes, in a story that made it to their cover for February’s edition this year, also reported that CZ’s crypto net-worth had jumped to between $1.1 billion to $2 billion at around the time of publication of their article.
 Binance, through its foundation, is one of the sponsors of the upcoming African Blockchain Foundation set to take place at Kampala Serena Hotel in May. CZ also confirmed his attendance. Saying that “I will be back here in two weeks.”

"PRESS STATEMENT: Why Uganda’s Government Should Take a Different Path to Social Media and Mobile Money Taxation
","There has been widespread concern over newly introduced levies on social media access and mobile money transactions in Uganda, which are widely considered a threat to internet access and affordability, as well as to freedom of expression and access to information.
 The effects of the taxes that took effect on July 1, 2018, were the focus of discussions at a recent stakeholder dialogue organized by the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA) and the Internet Society Uganda Chapter.
 At the dialogue, entrepreneurs, journalists, lawyers, activists, technologists, and academics shared their perspectives and experiences, resulting in a set of recommendations to the government on alternatives to the current modes of taxation.
 The government says the taxes are needed so as to expand the country’s tax base. In the 2018/2019 national budget speech, the finance ministry estimates that up to UGX 486 billion (USD 131 million) could be collected annually by 2022 from taxes on social media Over-The-Top (OTT) services.
 However,   presenting early results on an ongoing study on the impact of the taxes, Dr. Christopher Stork of Research ICT Solutions stated that the country’s rural-based users of social media and mobile money will be hardest hit by the taxes, increasing the percentage of the unconnected and resulting in decreased revenue for telecom/ internet operators. He said this would ultimately lead to reduced growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) and hamper job creation.

 This study’s preliminary results affirm earlier contentions, such as by the After Access researchers, that those who marginally afforded internet services before the taxes were introduced are likely to now find internet use totally unaffordable, thereby increasing the percentage of the unconnected.
 Meanwhile, Dr. Abdul Busuulwa, Executive Director at Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Africa Network, said whereas social media and mobile money platforms had eased the lives of persons with disabilities (PWDs), However, the increased cost of accessing these platforms due to the new taxes had reversed these gains. He said platforms like WhatsApp were helping in disseminating critical information among people with hearing difficulties before the added cost of using social media rendered them unaffordable to members of these groups, who he said already faced challenges in finding employment and often relied on financial support from others.
 Also read: Facebook is secretly fighting the recently implemented social media tax in Uganda
 The impact of the taxes on the use of online platforms for civic engagement on local governance was described by Samuel Mumbere, ICT Officer at the Kasese District Local Government in Western Uganda. According to Mumbere, whereas introduction of the taxes had prompted a rise in the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by community members who needed to maintain avenues of social accountability and access to information in the district, many were concerned about the additional costs related to data usage by some VPN products.
 On the access to justice front, the online legal knowledge and support platform, Barefoot Law, was cited as a social media-based service that had enabled citizens to access legal support and services which the poor are often excluded from due to financial constraints. Such platforms are also threatened with reduced use by citizens due to the taxes.
 Those in e-commerce cited barriers to accessing their clients, and reduced the competitiveness of their products and services, due to the taxes. The Managing Director of Jumia Uganda noted that the company’s work with some 3,000 different sellers, 1,000 hotels, and over 200 restaurants had experienced strained operations as their operations relied greatly on social media.
 Although the mobile money transactions tax is under review, with a new bill tabled before parliament proposing to reduce the tax from 1% to 0.5%, this does little to address the impact the tax will still have on financial inclusion. Feminist and writer, Edna Ninsiima, highlighted the role that mobile money has played in empowering unbanked women. She said the new transaction fees are affecting the financial independence of women – including building a savings culture – where it had been growing steadily.
 Meanwhile, Kojo Boakye, Public Policy Manager, Access and Connectivity, Facebook, cited the counter impact of the taxation on digital dividends including efforts to extend connectivity and broadband penetration. He questioned the likelihood of the tax raising the projected revenue, adding that the tax could also have an impact on the investment decisions of investors in infrastructure. In 2017, Facebook, in partnership with Airtel Uganda and Bandwidth and Cloud Services (BCS) Uganda announced a USD 100 million project to lay nearly 800 km of fiber optic cable in north-western Uganda. Like Facebook, Google has also worked to extend connectivity in Uganda with infrastructure investments including a wifi project in the capital, Kampala.
 Overall, participants at the dialogue pointed out that the taxes are not only discriminatory in nature but also disenfranchise already marginalized and vulnerable communities including PWDs, women, youth and rural communities. They called on the government to reassess its position on the taxes without inhibiting growth in ICT usage and innovation. The dialogue was also introspective with many noting that more proactive and collaborative efforts should be pursued by non-state actors, especially research and participating in consultative policy processes, to enhance informed decision-making by the government.
 This press statement was submitted by CIPESA.

"Hack4refugees is looking for solutions to longstanding problems in Ugandan Refugee Camps
","
 
 
 UNCDF and partners are organizing hack4refugees to look for solutions to the challenges affecting refugees in Ugandan camps.
 Uganda is the most welcoming country to refugees in the world. Neighboring countries like Rwanda, D.R. Congo, and South Sudan have relied on it in crises. Yet, this comes with challenges. Several refugee camps have challenges like agricultural productivity, distribution of items and goods.
 
 
 
 These solutions are able to boost their connectedness to the wider socio-economic system and restore their dignity so that they become agents of development of their own lives as well as their host communities, the official communication reads.
 
 In 2016, Uganda took in more refugees than any other part of the world. Yet the numbers continue to grow. As of 30th June 2017, there are currently 977, 746 refugees and asylum seekers from South Sudan in Uganda. Bringing the number to a total of 1.25 million refugees.
 The living conditions they are in are deplorable with lack of access to the basic essentials. These include education, food, and clean water. Theres also limited access to financial capital for survival, health, and medical facilities. This affects young women in need of maternity care as well as children exposed to malnutrition, and sanitation-related diseases.
 Filippo Grandi, the UN’s high commissioner for refugees reported that Uganda is at a breaking point. This is in regards to the surging number of refugees fleeing war struck South Sudan. This influx implies tremendous pressure on the host communities and the Ugandan economy. Besides that, the available aid and relief do not match the needs nor scale of the crisis.
 
 The Innovation Village in partnership with UNCDF, DanChurchAid and Mercy Corps are seeking for innovators with a passion for developing sustainable digital solutions that will address the highlighted challenges, reads the call to action. 
 
 &nbsp;
 Using the principles of Human Centred Design, the selected teams will get immersed in the refugee community to co-create workable solutions with the refugees before prototyping and testing their solutions over a 3 month period.
 There are three challenges; Information dissemination including delivery of education, training, and literacy, distribution of items and goods as well as agricultural services for increased productivity and marketing.
 Successful ideas will get judged on 5 fronts; creativity, scalability, teamwork, financial sustainability and feasibility.
 The process will kick off with the submission of applications (note deadline is 13th November 2017). Followed by a boot camp from 17  19 November 2017 at The Innovation Village in Ntinda.
 Get more details here, and or submit your application here.

"What Parallel Kampala Innovation Week Events Should Tell Us About the Ugandan Startup Ecosystem
","In the first week of October, we published this article about Kampala Innovation Week by The Innovation Village. After a few days, another person approached us about their event  also called Kampala Innovation week, to take place at Design Hub Kampala. They wanted us to write about it too.
 Amidst the confusion, we asked them if they were affiliated with the one we had recently written about. They said no. At what point we took it upon ourselves to inform both parties about the confusion they were causing in the Ugandan startup ecosystem.
 Fast forward, the two parties were able to reach an agreement yesterday [Monday] and agreed to have Kampala Innovation Week as a joint effort  something I think is good.
 Graphic Impression for the Kampala Innovation Week by Education Reach Uganda
 Im not interested in who was right and who was wrong. This writing is not intended to blame one party or applaud the other, no! The purpose is to highlight the fact that it was wrong to have two events, that are the same, happening in the same month and city.
 I have always stated and continue to maintain that dwarfs dont and shouldnt compete. Instead, each dwarf should stand on the shoulder of another so that the world can see them. Theres no use of having factions in a young and extremely small startup ecosystem like the Kampala one.
 In this VentureBeat article, CHRISTINE MCGUIGAN advises how smaller cities can build a robust startup ecosystem if they work together. Although not exhaustive and Africa focused, the key thing that it emphasizes is the power of synergy. Where each city  or in our case individual and stakeholder  focus on their strength.
 First of all, we have very few notable innovations in the country to even showcase for a whole week at one event. Now two events?
 Theres nothing wrong with pursuing individual or organizational goals. But, where certain activities of your vision intersect with another party, why not merge and face the challenges on a united front? My guess is that whoever is involved in the Ugandan Startup Ecosystem would eventually want to see Ugandan startups scale beyond borders.
 But, one of the things that will guarantee us this as an ecosystem is a complementarity approach, not competition. We need to focus on how, in our small capacities, we can each contribute as individuals and organizations to the bigger cause instead of copy and paste.
 Of what importance is competing to attract 100 startups to your hub or space thatll die the next year rather than coming together and agree to work in a way that ensures we have 10 startups thatll not only survive next year but go ahead to scale regionally and continentally afterward.
 One question we have all failed to answer, that was paused by an investor to one of the founders of a hub in Uganda, is  what startup in Uganda must an investor really know about?
 Graphic Impression of Kampala Innovation Week by Innovation Village
 This habit of each person wanting to have something attributed to their name no matter how deterrent it is to the ecosystem must be tackled. It has led to people writing proposals to secure grants to solve problems that others are already solving.
 As an ecosystem, we are still so young and small to attract anyones attention. Yet if we can come together, organize ourselves on the inside, we can easily use that as a leverage for networks with other mature ecosystems.
 As it is right now, the Ugandan startup ecosystem can only sustain startups to a certain level  beyond which, they have to struggle on their own to secure meaningful mentorship and funding. What if our joint focus is on supporting startups to that stage, perfectly, after which we can secure a partnership with another ecosystem where we can export them for further development?
 But, instead, we are busy copying each others event. It doesnt make sense to copy an event where even the innovations youre going to parade arent sure if theyll survive next year. On the other hand, just imagine you had such an event parading innovations to be exported say to Shenzen, Berlin, London, Tel Aviv, Silicon Valley or other mature ecosystems for further development?
 I also think that as an ecosystem, this needs to serve as a notice of how late we are when it comes to forming an association that brings us together  especially the hubs and incubators, who I think are the most critical players. Every stakeholder is scattered and trying to do what they feel is best for them. We do not have a defined and unified mission.
 Take an example of finances. As an ecosystem, we have a lot of startups in dire need of risk capital in the range of $10,000  $100,000 to start and operate for some few months as they prove their model. However, this is impossible for a typical Ugandan startup founder to raise. (See this: KENNETH LEGESI Looks at the Alternative Sources of Funding for Ugandan Startups)
 Yet, if we can come together and decide that every year, as an ecosystem, we shall jointly support 50  100 startups financially  then figure out what it takes, I am convinced that the government and other players can be on-boarded.
 If we can draft the kind of direction we want everything to go, then other players who pour directionless money in the ecosystem can easily be swayed to the predetermined direction. As it is, we are all running around like headless chicken doing what is just making us busy but not productive. We are just running in circles.
 By merely continuing to organize events, pitch competitions and applying for grants, were just scratching the bark of the tree, not digging up the roots. Until we focus on digging the roots, we shall continue competing on small things like organizing events with better decoration and sound systems.
 We shall continue bumping into each other from event to event and continue lamenting of the existing problems, picking up from where we stopped the last time. And, of course, we shall continue to churn out half-baked products and entrepreneurs that the brutal machine of real life will continue to choke before they even turn a year.

"Pitch perfect, a Ugandan online show focused on innovators, launches
","At the recently concluded Kampala Innovation Week, one of the activities was rewarding e-Fundi, the winner of Pitch Perfect, an online show.
 The awarding of the winner a few weeks ago, however, was the conclusion of the show that had began close to three months ago.
 Pitch Perfect, an online show featuring entrepreneurs pitching their solutions, started by a call for applications from entrepreneurs and innovators in all sectors. These stood a chance to win $1,000 as the prize.
 
 The show is as a product of the collaboration between Global Business Developers, The Innovation Village and IDEA TV (a company owned by The Innovation Village) but led by Allan Busby.
 According to Allan Busby, the Head of Global Business Developers, they received at least 50 applications. These were each called in for an interview to determine who should proceed to the next stage.
 Those interviews were to put a face to the idea and also help us tell which idea made sense, Allan said. Out of the 50, they managed to select 10 ideas that progressed to the next stage.
 Also read: These are the Ugandan startups that were in Hangzhou participating in Alibaba’s eFounders Initiative
 After this, each of the 10 was supposed to do a 1-minute pitch  conducted in an elevator  which was later uploaded on the IDEA Tv facebook page. The best idea or innovation was determined by the number of votes it receives. Each like equaled to a vote.
 Ultimately, e-Fundi, an online market-place for mechanics and spare parts, emerged the winner of the $1,000.
 According to Allan, this was the first edition. Their end goal is to have it run and get better several times a year with each edition of the show having multiple episodes. Our initial plan was to have a show that has up to 10 episodes, he said.
 Though they are currently constrained by resources and its partly due to the lack of partners. I believe with [other] partners onboard, we will be able [to hold it frequently], Allan pointed out.
 Also read: Leapfrog Ventures to invest $190k into Uganda’s trio; Xente, Swipe2pay &amp; Francom
 Apart from The Innovation Village, they failed to secure other partners that could have boosted their capability to do more. They tried to look for partners but failed.
 We tried to look for partners, Allan said, but being a new and online idea, most of the [potential] partners were skeptical.
 Though, he is optimistic that they will be able to onboard some given the viewership numbers and reach they demonstrated with the first one. We had over 80,000 [people] reached, with over 30,000 people liking and viewing the videos and over 300,000 minutes watched, he said.
 They are looking at having Pitch Perfect at least twice or quarterly every year. And, so far, Allan says that their previous partner  The Innovation Village  is willing to come on board for another edition.
 I already got a heads up from our initial funder and they were like we need to do this again, he said.
 According to my conversation with Allan, their target is partners who are currently or looking to support innovators. These, he believes, will benefit from either advertisement or as a way of CSR.
 
 Some companies have tried to run hackathons but have not yielded results. [Yet] if youre partnering with the Innovation Village which ran successfully the Hack for refugees, the Data Hack for Financial inclusion, then youre guaranteed [results].
 
 Pitch Perfect isnt the first show pitching show focused innovators and pitching.
 In 2016, Uber launched UberPITCH across 37 cities and 21 countries. The goal was to give entrepreneurs  the chance of a lifetime by connecting you to some of the region’s top investors.
 This was initially in Europe, but, it later spread to Africa. In February 2017, Uber held UberPITCH in Nairobi followed up by UberPITCH in South Africa in August this year.
 The difference is that the entrepreneurs during UberPITCH sessions come already polished and pitch active investors. This is the missing gap in Pitch Perfect. Currently, it isnt any different from other competitions where entrepreneurs are given money and thats the end.
 Though Allan says that they are also looking at entrepreneurs having to pitch to active investors as one of the key benefits. With the final prize as a bonus.

"Flutterwave now has $20M in total funding. The CEO is stepping down
","Flutterwave, a payments startup, has completed its Series A Extension round of financing. The investment came from Mastercard, CRE Ventures, Fintech Collective, 4DX Ventures, Raba Capital and more.
 The round brought Flutterwaves total funding raised to-date to at least $20 million. Currently, their largest investors include Green Visor Capital and Greycroft Partners.
 As part of the deal, current Green Visor Capital Chairman &amp; General Partner and former Chairman &amp; CEO of Visa, Joe Saunders, joined the Flutterwave Board of Directors.
 Though the startup didnt point out how much, the figure is likely to be at least $9 million. This is because Flutterwave announced the raising of $10 million mid last year. This brought their total amount of funding then to $10.1 million. There was no other funding announced between.
 Africa is becoming the payments battleground for the worlds largest payments multinationals.
 Last month, Visa and Tencent participated in Paystacks $8 million Series A. While Mastercard announced a partnership that will allow MTN Mobile Money users to make online purchases using virtual cards. The company has now followed this up with investing in Flutterwave.

 In the same press release, Flutterwave announced that their CEO was stepping down. The reason behind the move was personal and involved pursuing family goals.
 In a separate development, Flutterwave CEO, Iyin Aboyeji, has stepped down, wrote Fluttewave. Iyin wrote; It’s been amazing working with the Flutterwave team to build another great African company and I’m excited for the future under its new leadership.”
 Iyinoluwa  who is still just 27 years  cofounded Andela in 2014 before leaving to co-found Flutterwave in 2016. He has come to brand himself as a problem solver rather than a startup founder. Therefore, it is highly likely that theres another problem he is looking to bring a solution to life for.
 Given his previous track record with the two now globally recognized startups, capital, talent, and partnerships arent likely to be his main hurdles.
 Another co-founder  who has before worked at Paypal and Google will take the reins.
 Flutterwave Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, will replace Iyin Aboyeji as CEO. Olugbenga Agboola is a Financial Technology Engineer, with core financial services technology experiences with Paypal, Google, GTBank, Access bank, Standard /StanbicIBTC Bank.
 Headquartered in San Francisco, Flutterwave currently has regional offices in Lagos, Nairobi, Accra, and Johannesburg. It also has operations in Uganda. Flutterwaves clients include Transferwise, Flywire, Booking.com, JumiaPay, and Uber, among others.

"Fatoumata&#8217;s Janngo is Raising a $56M West Africa-Focused Startup Fund
","According to a report from the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, VC funds in the U.S. raised $55.5 billion from investors throughout 2018. That is the most since the infamous dot com era. However, this surge in venture capital raised by funds isn’t limited to the United States. It is a global movement with individuals, institutions and economies who are looking to strategically take advantage of the startup wave.
 In March this year, Bloomberg reported that French President Emmanuel Macron had pledged to invest 2.5 billion Euros in Africa by means of financially aiding startups and small- to medium-sized enterprises by 2022.
 Earlier, in August 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that Great Britain would make major investments in Africa. While on a three-day tour of the continent, May pledged 4 billion pounds ($5.1 billion) of support for African markets. The main goal of Britains investment will be to harness the innovation and creativity of the young people of Africa, May said.
 Besides states like Britain and France, global development institutions have shown a keen interest in backing funds looking to invest in African startups.
 Last year, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the African Development Bank (AfDB), CDC Group and the European Investment Bank (EIB) were among the most active development financing institutions (DFIs) acting as Limited Partners, seeding funds targeted towards African startups.
 According to Digest Africa data, in 2018, there were 12 funds noted as closed (first, second or final close) targeting Africa startups. These funds, which raised US $740 million, recorded the participation by the DFIs noted above in at least 7 funds.
 For example, at least two Africa-focused VC funds have reached a close with the support and participation of the EIB and AfDB: the US $143 million Partech Africa Fund and $40 million TLcom Tide Africa Fund, while CDC Group was an investor in the US $72.5 million Novastar II Fund.
 However, these institutions  particularly EIB, are not about to slow down. Ivory Coast-based Janngo  which describes itself as Africa’s first startup studio  is about to become the latest beneficiary of the bank’s spending spree trend.
 Also read: Africa-focused fund managers raised $1.094B in 2018
 Digest Africa got ahold of documents indicating Janngo is currently raising a fund called Janngo Capital Startup Fund. The fund has a target size of EUR 50 million (~ USD 56 million) with a keen focus on sub-Saharan Africa  especially West Africa. The European Investment Bank is looking to be a limited partner with an approximate EUR 12 million investment in the fund.
 “The fund will be set up to support new startups in the digital and technology sectors (high-tech companies), with the main focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.”
 According to Tim Smit from EIB, the bank is yet to make the decision regarding the investment, though he pointed out that the “opportunity [to invest] is [being] considered by the EIB as it fits the objectives of the Impact Envelope under the ‘Cotonou mandate’”.
 The Janngo team is led by Fatoumata Ba who also doubles as the Chief Executive Officer. She is mostly known for launching Jumia in Ivory Coast which she ran from 2013 to 2015 according to her LinkedIn profile. Ba then went ahead to serve as the General Manager of Jumia in Lagos, Nigeria for a year from 2015 to 2016.
 There are no other details regarding who else will be a part of the Janngo Capital Startup Fund team. However, Tim pointed out that the “team is still under construction”. Digest Africa contacted Fatoumata via email regarding the fund, but there was no response by the time of publication.
 There are no details related to when the fund will close as the process of raising is still in the early stages. Though Janngo Capital Startup Fund is expected to be a generalist in terms of sectors with a “strong innovative/digital focus”. The Fund will mainly focus on investments in venture capital from seed to series B.
 In May last year, Janngo raised a EUR 1 million Seed round “to shape digital ecosystems and create pan-African tech champions”.

"Tips for African Entrepreneurs Looking to Expand Internationally
","Statistics released in the African Economic Outlook 2017 report suggest that of the 18 countries in the continent where data was available, the percentage of the working-age population that set up its own companies to tap specific opportunities stood at 11%. The number stands at 5% in Asia and 8% in Latin America, going to show that the entrepreneurial spirit in Africa is alive and kicking.
 According to Smallstarter, an online platform where African entrepreneurs get access to ideas and guidance, there are opportunities for the taking across different sectors such as FinTech, renewable energy, food processing, and fashion.  If you, like several other African entrepreneurs, are thinking about testing international waters, doing some groundwork will hold you in good stead.
 Develop Your Brand
 While there are several young entrepreneurs in Africa with great ideas, not many get the attention they deserve, and one of the main reason for this is poor brand positioning. Before you decide to take your brand overseas, make sure you take time in determining how you wish to tell your story. Focus not just on the product or service you offer, but also on how you plan to sell it.
 Get a Local Perspective
 Before you think about expanding into any new territory, determine if there is a demand for your products or services. Try not to stick to regions where other African entrepreneurs venture, and instead, look for places where the demand for your offerings is high. For example, if your business deals in metals and minerals, you can turn toward the Indian subcontinent.

 Take into account that cultural differences might have an effect on your business, and determine if you can take measures to bridge any possible divide. If you don’t feel comfortable operating in a particular market, it is best that you look for other alternatives. Pay attention to the competition you might face, and determine how you will set your business apart.
 Build a Strong Team
 The most successful people in the world may not be the most intelligent but what they tend to do is build great teams of highly competent individuals. While your employees, at home and in a foreign country, should be proficient in what they do, they should also be dependable and trustworthy. Get your team to focus on specific goals, keep communication channels open, and value every team member.
 Think Strategic Partnerships
 Growing a business in Africa often involves creating strategic partnerships, in which case you will need to work on a Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA). While getting into an SPA is relatively easy, getting out of one might be easier said than done. As a result, it is important that you select your partners carefully. Take time to understand how a possible partner operates and look at its core values before you decide to sign any paperwork.
 Handle Foreign Currency Exchange Correctly
 When you take your business overseas, you will get paid in foreign currencies. You may also have international employees who you might want to pay from your home country. In both cases, you will have to deal with the exchange of currencies. Fortunately, there are several overseas money transfer companies that facilitate payments to and from most African countries. TransferWise and WorldFirst, for instance, provide multicurrency accounts for businesses and online sellers, giving them easy means to hold funds and transact in a number of currencies.
 Conclusion
 Taking your new business outside of Africa can be fruitful provided you spend time in understanding your target market. Part of the process requires that you analyze your competition, and make sure you have a great team in place.

"Ethiopian Airlines to start accepting payments made via Alipay
","Ethiopian Airlines, Africas largest aviation group, will start accepting payments made via Alipay. That is according to a statement issued by CellPoint Mobile, the airlines global payments partner.
 The Alipay integration is the first in our PSP (payments solution provider) partnership in China and an important step in our airlines growth strategy for the mobile channel, said Miretab Teklaye, Director Digital, at Ethiopian Airlines.
 In the recent past, the number of Chinese tourists across the globe has grown as well as their spend. The trend is the same for Africa as it has become one of their top destinations.
 
 With 100 million Chinese traveling abroad every year, more merchants in Southeast Asia, Western Europe, North America – and now Ethiopia – are investing in mobile solutions to support Alipay for Chinese visitors and tourists, as well as foreign expats living in China, wrote CellPoint.
 This partnership, thus, makes sense for Ethiopian  as the continents largest carrier. And, it is with no doubt that the company is targeting Chinese tourists coming to the continent.
 By adding support for Alipay, Ethiopian Airlines is strengthening its position not only as the flag carrier of Ethiopia but as a leading airline for commercial air travel within Africa, said Ciaran Wilson, Senior Sales &amp; Account Director at CellPoint Mobile.
 Similarly, the same partnership makes sense for Alipay as it seeks to gain ground across the African continent.
 On his last trip to the continent, Ma pointed out payments and tourism among the three sectors that are yet to be developed on the continent.

 In July this year, Ethiopian Airlines selected CellPoint Mobile as its global payments solution provider (PSP). As part of the partnership, CellPoint would add many new alternative payment methods (APMs) to its mobile app that resonate with its passengers.
 The list included AliPay and WeChat Pay, yet they have been able to secure the former first. This perhaps can be explained by Jack Mas interest in the continent. Alipay, through the parent company  Ant Financial  is on a drive to establish itself as a payment force on the continent.

"GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund adds 6 African startups
","The GSMA has announced the 3rd cohort of startups that joined their Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund. The cohort of 11 startups from emerging markets features 6 from Africa.
 These are; Agrocenta (Ghana), Coliba (Ivory Coast), Eneza Education (Ivory Coast), GiftedMom (Cameroon), KEA Medicals (Benin) and Taskmoby (Ethiopia).
 These are joining the first two intakes of April 2017 and February 2018, bringing the portfolio size to 35, out of which, 21 are from Africa. These cover 23 markets in total, including eight new countries.
 
 The breadth of sectors represented within the portfolio is also expanding with new challenges
 
 According to Max Cuvellier, Head of the Ecosystem Accelerator, these have already delivered very encouraging results. Estimating them to have reached 1.6 million beneficiaries by the various projects funded by the programme. Adding that an the equivalent of £2.5 million of additional income has been unlocked collectively.
 
 This is through direct revenue increases for citizens and local businesses, savings or productivity gains. On the investment front, two thirds of the start-ups have now raised follow-on funding totalling £32.9 million.
 Some of the successes are because of partnerships with mobile operators. 10 of which have already been established with support from the programme, he said.
 It is not clear how much each of the portfolio companies receives in funding. However, Agrocentas Francis Obirikorang announced on his LinkedIn that they had received 6 digit investment from GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Fund and DFID. While previous companies like Musanga have recorded a figure equal to $266,000.

"Tugende, an asset-financing company, is expanding into leasing cars
","Tugende, an asset-financing company that operates a lease-to-own business model, is moving to start leasing cars after raising $5 million in debt from OPIC.
 This was revealed by the companys CEO, Michael Wilkerson, in an interview, I had with him recently. We are running a pilot right now with special hires (cabs), he said.
 Before, Tugende has been focused primarily on the leasing of boda-bodas (motorcycles). This, thus, comes as a new addition to their offering.
 In his pitches and speeches, Michael emphasizes their drive to help entrepreneurs with income generating assets. This, thus, is why they are piloting with cab drivers. Because they are self-employed and are using the car as an asset rather than a luxury.
 
 Thats our entire mission, it is to help people help themselves, put them in control and so if we could figure out the economics that will be very exciting, Michael Wilkerson, Tugende CEO.
 
 Though, there is a challenge that will come with branching out to finance cars  centering around the period it will take to pay off the car. This can be attributed to the fact that cars are more expensive as compared to boda-bodas.
 Additionally, they are less profitable according to Michael. The challenges with that are that they dont earn as much money as motorcycles compared to the cost of the asset so the repayment period has to be longer, Michael said.

 Though, he maintained that they are committed to figuring out whats necessary because the demand for the service is there.
 But overall its working and we have the same dynamics, where a lot of people driving special hire vehicles are renting and would like to own, and we want to put them in control, Michael pointed out.
 Currently, they are looking at the various types of cars they should be leasing. Though they seem to be having a soft spot for electric ones. So we are looking at other types of vehicles, we have seen hybrid electric vehicles starting to penetrate Nairobi, Michael said.
 According to Michael, Electric Vehicles are exciting because they are cost friendly since they dont need fuel  which is a significant expense for their clients.
 I am really excited because if there is a way to finance that and reduce the fuel expenditure, that would also make it more profitable for the driver and hopefully allow them to take ownership faster
 Asked if they are looking to have a special partnership with drivers who are already partners with ride-hailing companies like Uber and Taxify, Michael said that they are not yet sure. Though they are open to conversations.
 Tugende was founded in 2009 by Michael and his friend Matt Brown as a side project. Andrew Mwenda joined them in 2010 both as an investor and co-founder and they formerly started operating as Tugende towards the end of 2012.

"Startup of the Week: Milima Technologies &#8211; all your tech problems solved.
","Milima Technologies is a Ugandan technology startup dealing in cyber security, networks, software and web technologies.
 According to Milima Technologies, there are a number of companies in Uganda building solutions and delivering services within the ICT industry, yet very few are able to deliver to global standard solutions.
 Even those that are able to, their prices are usually not affordable to Ugandan small and medium sized enterprises. The result? They are left to face the ever increasing digital divide and fall short of global standards.
 Milima Technologies was conceived with a vision of providing global standard cutting-edge solutions in cyber security, networks, software and web technologies to equip small and medium sized enterprises with necessary solutions to deliver at global level.
 They are currently self-sustaining with the revenue generated from delivery of their products and services to clients. The startup is currently located at the Innovation Village,in Ntinda.
 One of their top most success is their ever increasing client base and a number of partnerships from both small and large projects. The team does take all of them on with the same level of enthusiasm.
 Milima Technologies recently teamed up with Inpedio, a Netherlands based cyber security company whose core interest is in building mobile based security solutions. According to Chagara, the Managing Directors, this partnership will see Milima Technologies become a sole distributor and technical support provider of the mobile security solutions in Uganda.
 They are also in the early stages of establishing a sister non-for-profit organisation in Northern Uganda called Milima Cyber Academy. Milima Cyber Academy will be providing industry certified courses in cyber security, networks engineering and software development.
 The academy was conceived with a vision of extending global standard tech services and training to the currently recovering region which still grapples with low standards of living, wide digital divide and slow ICT penetration rate following the over two decades of civil war led by LRA.
 The team is currently made up of three; Chagara Emmanuel  Founder &amp; Managing Director, Amuge Naomi, Director Finance &amp; Administration and Nalwoga Cerinah Trillion, Business Development Manager.
 Like any rising startup in Africa, Milima Technologies experiences challenges with resource mobilization and funding. Lack of funding directly affects the rate and capacity of project execution. This in turn leads to questionable delivery period in certain circumstances.
 There is also competition with global enterprises. Whereas startups like Milima are well equipped with necessary skills to deliver services of global quality, a lot of work is still needed to encourage collaboration between Ugandan start-ups.

"Apply to Next Einstein Forum&#8217;s innovation competition, Ci2i
","Yesterday, the Next Einstein Forum (NEF) launched its search for Africa’s brightest innovators to compete in its NEF Challenge of Invention to Innovation (Ci2i). This was announced in the initiatives official blog.
 NEF is calling upon Young African scientists and innovators under 42 years of age to present their research-driven innovations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to a panel of experts in a pitch style competition at the NEF Global Gathering 2018 to be held 26-28 March 2018 in Kigali, Rwanda, under the patronage of H.E. President Paul Kagame.
 
 “While innovation competitions have become commonplace in Africa, the NEF Challenge of Invention to Innovation (NEF Ci2i) seeks to support the scale-up of research-driven innovations. This global gathering, we have selected three forward-looking categories: Deeptech innovations, climate-smart innovations and personalized health innovations. These strategic categories and the innovations that will come out of NEF Ci2i are not only relevant for Africa but will give African innovators competitive edge globally,” Mr Thierry Zomahoun, President and CEO of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) and Founder and Chair of NEF.
 
 Judges and participants come from major Pan-African and global business, pharmaceutical and technological companies providing an unparalleled opportunity for researchers and entrepreneurs, both in terms of feedback and mentorship and in terms of funding to scale and expand R&amp;D efforts.
 “The goal of the Ci2i competition is to reward research-based innovation and highlight the global impact of African researchers and entrepreneurs. At the NEF, we believe that inventions, especially science-driven ones, are critical to Africa’s transformation. It is not enough to have ideas or inventions, to impact humanity these inventions must reach the people and become innovations. The Ci2i is one platform which will bridge this gap,” said Dr Youssef Travaly, Director of Programs and Lead Scientist at the NEF.

"What you should know about GreenTec&#8217;s investment into Nigeria&#8217;s Parcel-IT
","Early this month, German-based GreenTec Capital Partners announced that it had invested an undisclosed amount in Nigerian logistics startup, Parcel-IT.
 But, before, Parcel-IT had secured investment from the Tony Elumelu Foundation. That is according to Gregory Ojore Asenime, the founder and CEO.
 Apart from friends, family, and savings, our first institutional investment was from the Tony Elumelu Foundation who invested $10000, Gregory wrote in an email.
 Though, GreenTecs investment, like in many of its investees, isnt disclosed. This is partly because it might not be easy to quantify or many would think the startup has actually received cash in the bank. Which isnt the case when it comes to GreenTec.
 According to another investee I spoke to, their investment is usually non-monetary.
 Gregory said that the investment is undisclosed but progressive and has a lot of non-monetary aspects as well. Though, it is all equity-based. Some of the non-monetary aspects include; facilitating entry into new markets, technology transfer, raising capital as well as leveraging on Gree3nTec’s relationships and networks.
 GreenTec has branded itself as an impact focused investor. I was thus interested in understanding which type of impact they foresaw in Parcel-IT.
 There was an impact opportunity not just in our current solution but more in what our future plans are, said Gregory. Who added that GreenTec saw ways to have these improved.
 
 One of these impact opportunities is a means of incorporating a fintech solution, developing a risk-scoring solution to facilitate loyal customers’ transaction capacities with short-term financing, creating financial inclusion in the process and better business decision-making tools for these merchants.
 
 Founded in 2016, Parcel-IT was inactive in the first year and actual operations only began in June last year. Currently, they have a team of four permanent employees and a couple of other freelance staff.
 Although their main operations are in Lagos, Gregory maintains that they are definitely looking to expand. We are currently in Lagos but our short to mid-term plans have us expand to other cities within Nigeria.
 They are also looking at beyond the Nigerian borders. However, strategic alliances are what got us this far and weve been building such alliances both preliminary and advanced in other African cities.
 The startup is currently handling between 10-20 orders daily for small businesses. But Gregory says that is because they are not operating at full capacity. We are on a scheduled break for tech re-engineering and upgrades, which has meant only key partners are currently being served.
 GreenTec Capital Partners has stepped up its activity across the African continent. This week, they announced the opening of a West African office in Lagos. Yet, before that, they had also made many investments.
 Their portfolio includes Wazi Vision (Uganda), ARED (Rwanda), FarmCrowdy (Nigeria), AgroCenta (Ghana), Bismart (Kenya) and more.

"Uber and Little are looking to launch operations in Rwanda
","Ride-hailing companies Uber and Little are looking to enter Rwanda according to The New Times. The reports say that both have already approached Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA).
 Without divulging details, the Head of Transport at RURA, Eng. Emmanuel Asaba, told The New Times on Wednesday that Uber approached the regulatory body this year with an aim to start operations in the country.
 
 “Well, Uber has approached Rwanda and as you know, this is a regulated service they came to us and we gave them the [list of] requirements needed to get a licence and they are yet to come and fulfill the requirements and get the licence. Once they come and we check that whatever we require is complete then definitely we’ll give them a licence and they start operating,” Asaba said.
 
 He also added that Uber is one of the many that have approached them for a licence. Uber is one of the many to taxi-hailing service providers that have approached them with enquiries on details of acquiring an operating licence, The New Times wrote.
 Among those interested include Safaricom-backed Little. Kamal Budhabhatti, CEO of Little, was quoted saying that they are in discussions with a local partner to bring Little in Kigali.”
 While Yego Innovision Ltd, the owner of Yego Motos was already given a green light to launch Yego Cabs. “In taxi cabs we have Yego Cab, which was licenced recently. It has [a] licence for both motorcycles and taxi cabs, Asaba revealed.
 If both Uber and Little go ahead and launch in Rwanda, this will be the 9th and 3rd market for each respectively. Taxify will likely follow suit.

"Blockchain might render you Jobless or out of Business
","The buzz lately is about blockchain enabled Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading. People are trying to figure out how to make a killing from the volatile appreciation of Bitcoins whose price hit USD 20,000 a while back. Some governments are fighting cryptocurrencies while others have adopted the wait and see approach. Top business leaders have come out to make comments in support of or against Bitcoin.
 Amidst all this, we seem to be missing the point. The issue of focusing on Bitcoin while ignoring Blockchain is akin to getting excited about the cars being driven without appreciating the road on which they are driving. Blockchain is the road on which the likes of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are driving themselves to public appeal.
 The advent of Blockchain has redefined technology and it will likely take a couple of years before its massive impact is felt. Blockchain is a technology that replaces the middleman when it comes to transactions through the use of direct peer to peer interactions.
 We have big businesses and prominent professions that have been curved out to purely act as middlemen between producers and consumers. The financial industry is littered with banks whose primary role is to enable Person A pay Person B or aggregate money from multiple depositors and lend it out to the borrowing few. In the process, they get a commission.
 If you take the example of an international money transaction where an individual in Uganda is paying a supplier in China for some goods. This individual will initiate a transfer through his bank and the intermediaries are; the Ugandan’s local bank, a correspondent bank, an international clearing house, another correspondent bank and finally the Chinese supplier’s local bank. Each of these intermediaries slaps a financial surcharge on the transaction. Time is another factor that features prominently in these transactions, taking between two and four days before maturing.
 
 See also: Here’s how Blockchain technology is fixing what the internet had failed
 
 This is a classic case of middlemen creating a higher burden of transacting. The effect of Bitcoin is to erase the necessity of middlemen between producers and consumers by replacing them with peer to peer systems. The infographic below illustrates this.
  
 Apart from the financial industry, some of the industries likely to be grossly impacted by Blockchain include the Real Estate, Insurance, Global Logistics and Shipping, Advertising and Crowdfunding.
 In Uganda, if you are in need of purchasing land or renting a house, you have to engage brokers who identify the various plots of land ready for sale by their owners, pay a site visit, establish the land ownership, haggle over the price and then upon agreement, pay up before transfer of the title is effected.
 Often times, there are loopholes in this process, like;
 
 The land ownership could have been tampered with thereby falsely presenting someone else as the owner
 The owner could be simultaneously peddling the same land to another buyer who might end up paying too.
 The documentation on the land could be tampered with to hide the existence of caveats that may have been placed on the land.
 And many more …..
 
 Enter blockchain and its ledger approach that clearly chronicles all transaction changes of a system without giving room for illicit alterations. Software-based solutions can now be developed to address the loopholes as well as ease the customer experience in this real estate sector.
 Property listings can be made available on a blockchain enabled system that allows users to upload information of their property like the physical address, ownership, title information, selling or rental price among others.
 The same blockchain enabled system could act as a storage of information on ownership status and history. This would then quickly allow an interested party to identify the true ownership status of the property as well as a history of transactions. Any encumbrances on the property can also be revealed at this point. Currently, this process is largely paper-based and time-consuming. One is expected to physically visit the Lands office, submit a request, make payments to a bank and then wait for the officials to carry out the manual search.
 When it comes to agreements, Blockchain supports Smart Contracts. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written in the programmed software. They permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among anonymous parties without the need for a lawyer. They also render the transactions traceable, transparent and irreversible.
 
 See also: Blockchain technology could be Ugandan banks’ answer to mobile money
 
 I was once involved in a land transaction where I was given the land title for verification with the lands office, a process that took a couple of days before I could revert to the seller. During that time, he got so scared and thought that I had duped him. My delay was largely caused by the various individuals we had to go through to confirm the title ownership. All these manual steps can be circumvented by blockchain enabled systems.
 In this real estate example, it is evident that land brokers, search agents and lawyers are likely to be edged out if they do not find ways of redefining their roles.
 In the financial sector, money transfer agents and forex bureau operators are likely to be heavily affected.
 I advise you to study your profession, see how you can take advantage of the emerging Blockchain technology and begin riding the wave before everyone else. Blockchain is the future, just like the World Wide Web was correctly predicted as the future towards the end of the last century. If you hope to remain relevant as a business or a professional, it’s time to reposition yourself.

"UCC goes after bloggers, digital media and other online publishers
","UCC has issued a notice to online data communication and broadcast service providers. It calls upon them to register in order to get authorization to operate.
 All online data communication service providers including online publishers, on-line [sic] news platforms, online radio and television operators are therefore [sic], advised to apply and obtain authorization from the commision with immediate effect, the notice reads.
 Some think this is vaguely written because it doesnt clarify exactly who it covers or should register. Though, the first group that comes to mind are Bloggers, Podcasters, YouTubers and Vloggers. One of the people that commented, said: it appears this laws interpretation is weak and subjective in terms of who it may apply to. 
 But, when we contacted UCCs head of PR Pamela Ankunda, she said that the registration is for online publication service providers. Adding that it applies to all online content creators apart from those whose content differs from daily news submission. Citing an example of researchers as a group it doesnt cover.

 UCC is the corporate body charged with regulating communication services in Uganda. This, according to Section 4 of the Uganda Communications Act of 2013, includes telecommunications, radio, television, broadcasting and postal and courier services.
 The authority has come under criticism on several occasions for being a tool used by the ruling government to gag media and press freedom. In 2016, during the general elections, UCC switched off access to Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. The major online social and messaging platforms in Uganda.
 
 Does this mean blogs should register? .@DigestAfrica .@pctechmagazine .@campusbeeug pic.twitter.com/NItWP2I5rQ

 It has also occasionally switched off radio stations as well as sent warning letters to radio and TV stations stopping them from covering or hosting key opposition-leaning political figures. 
 Ugandas opposition enjoys the lead on most of the social platforms given it is made of the urban and semi-urban groups. Something that might raise questions about UCCs interest in online publications.
 Earlier this year, Godfrey Mutabaazi, the Executive Director of UCC told Uganda Radio Network that Uganda would have its own Facebook and Twitter. A move some thought was looking to censor online communication amongst citizens.
 That [launching local social networks] is one of the projects we are working on next year. There is an investor who is bringing our own social media platforms. Instead of Twitter, youre going to have something local that youre going to use, Godfrey said.
 UCC might succeed in registering the online publications. But, it is the regulation that might pause a challenge. Especially if the entire process is a knee-jerk reaction to the problem rather than a well thought out one.
 The commission shall, from the 2nd of April 2018, embark on enforcement activities against all non-compliant providers of on-line [sic] data communication services, and this may entail directing Internet Service Providers (ISP) to block access to such websites and/or streams, the notice says.
 Though, I wonder how this will be possible for other publishers who use platforms like Facebook, YouTube and other sites hosted outside Uganda. For example, at one point, the government had asked Facebook to close TVO’s account. But Facebook turned down the request.

"Zola Electric raises further $32.5M to expand across Tanzania
","Zola Electric  former Off Grid Electric  has raised $32.5 million in debt funding. FMO and Symbiotics arranged the facility to finance the growth of ZOLA’s Tanzania operations over the next 5 years.
 The FMO-arranged senior loan will consist of $5 million from the Access to Energy Fund (AEF), which catalyses the investment of $12.5 million from FMO-A and $15 million from Symbiotics. The tenor of the loan is five years. ZOLA Electric borrows the money in its local currency, the Tanzanian shilling.
 Before the current financing, FMO also provided Technical Assistance to ZOLA. But, the aim of that assistance was to put a credit scoring system in place.
 This is the third round of funding that Zola Electric is announcing this year. In January, they raised a $55 million Series D from GE Ventures and Helios Investment Partners. In July, they also announced a $20 million debt facility from SunFunder.
 
 The investment is also expected to create around 2,100 new jobs in off-grid solar, according to Zola Electric
 
 In total, the company has raised over $200 million in funding. Though the amount has come in a mixture of equity, debt and investment structures. This figure puts them among the most funded clean energy companies in Africa.
 Zola Electric is hoping that this FMO round of funding will grow their service delivery in Tanzania to an more 145,500 households. The company currently powers more than 1,000,000 customers across 5 countries and employs more than 1,000 people.
 Currently, ZOLA Electric serves over 180,000 homes and businesses across Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ghana. The energy company is also a recipient of the UN Momentum for Change Award, the Zayed Future Energy Prize and is a member of the Global Cleantech 100.

"Weekly Preview: Everything you need to know about Up Accelerate&#8217;s Boot Camp, The first URSB IP Awards, and so much more&#8230;
","With everything going on lately, staying informed of all that is happening in the small world of startups and entrepreneurship can be challenging  especially for those interested in Uganda where theres just a few sources of real-time information. This is a gap we want to fill. It is important that you can get all the information that is relevant to you in one place.
 We are introducing a Weekly Preview. Every week we will compile this short guide that will attempt to summarize just the information you need to know that week so you dont miss anything important.
 The Weekly Preview will make recommendations for which events to attend, which competition to consider or which job to apply to and so much more. Of course, we also tell you why you should consider our recommendations.
 With this, we believe youll save thousands of minutes at the end of the year while getting relevant information in minutes. Lets all agree  it will take you under 4 minutes to find out everything you need to know for the week.
 Lets get started already!
 Competitions
 
 USRB Intellectual Property Awards
 
 This is the first time Uganda Registration Services Bureau is organizing innovation awards. They will take place on the 26th April 2017  which also happens to be the World Intellectual Property Day according to the IP arm of UN, World Intellectual Property Organization.
 Deadline for application to these awards is 18th April 2017.
 We took a look at the application form and we can tell you these awards favor innovators that are already at prototype stage  not idea stage. Therefore, we encourage those who already have a minimum viable product to apply. But if you havent gotten to that stage yet but you think you have a great idea, you should go ahead and apply too. Good luck!
 We thought it strange that applicants are required to download a PDF form from the URSB website, fill it in and then submit by email or hand deliver it at any of their eight offices country wide. Hilarious, isnt it? We can think of a number of ways they could have made the process simpler.
 
 Africa Entrepreneurship Awards
 
 These awards premiered in 2015 and applications rolled in from most countries across the continent  Uganda too. 10 winners were chosen by the Jury to share the prize of USD 1 Million. From a total 31 finalists, 3 were Ugandans.
 These were; Martin Barungi, 45 years at that time, whose unique crowdfunding platform creates an online marketplace so that anyone in Africa can find affordable finance to build a home. Olivia Akware, 29 years at that time, from Brick to Housing Pioneer Women Project (BHP) which fires bricks from a kiln powered by agro and bio-waste products. Lastly, it was Richard Bbaale, 32 years at that time, who created BanaPads, sanitary napkins made out of banana stems. Of the three, Olivia emerged one of the ten winners. What she did with the loot is a story we hope to share on another day.
 The awards were held again in 2016 and of all the Ugandan applicants, only Joyce Kyalema managed to make it to the winners list walking away with $100,000 to help her with her project. Still, on how she used that money, is another story thatll come to you in our follow-up section.
 This years deadline for submission of application is 28th of April 2017. You may realize that the deadline isnt this week, but because how important these awards are, we thought it wise to remind you earlier.
 We analyzed the applicants that won in the last two years and they all had one thing in common. Their ideas address a challenge facing the average Ugandan/African. We can also tell there isnt a strong focus on technology but impact in form of job creation and how effective your startup or business is in improving livelihoods. Does your startup or business fall under this? Then take a look at the application here!
 Events
 Every week, events happen in Uganda, Africa and the world over that Ugandan startups and entrepreneurs may have interest in. Here are some of the events you should consider this week and why.
 
 Pitch Tuesday
 
 This takes place every Tuesday at The Resilient Africa Network(RAN) office located in Upper terrace Kololo. The event offers an opportunity to, especially early stage entrepreneurs who may not know much on how to pitch their startup or product to potential investors or partners.
 This is a mock pitch conducted infront of fellow entrepreneurs and startup founders who later give you feedback on your performance. However, it is a good idea to get in touch with the RAN team and book your appointment. Remember, your idea must be well thought out so make sure you are well prepared for your pitch. We recommend this to fresh graduates and all those just planning on venturing into entrepreneurship.
 
 Up Accelerate Cycle II Boot Camp at Mbarara University
 
 The Up Accelerate program is dedicated to Sexual Reproductive Health. Its in its second year of running with the winners of the first cycle already being incubated.
 The team from the program has made numerous rounds across universities in Uganda. We think this was to ensure as many ideas and startups are captured. Following the list of winners from 2016, we highly encourage startups or entrepreneurs that already have something they are doing to attend this event and of course apply. As usual, this is not aimed at discouraging anyone with an idea.
 Thats it for this week! Hope you enjoyed your holidays.

"Ugandan podcast focused on technology is soon launching
","A Ugandan podcast that will focus on technology and finance is set to launch. The hosts are two technology enthusiasts  Asindu Wilfred and Daniel Mwesigwa. Dubbed Vigilant Futurist, itll also cover the latest trends in technology in Uganda.
 Vigilant means keeping careful watch for possible danger or difficulties, said Asindu. Adding that Futurist means having or involving very modern technology or design.
 The podcast will, thus, be about how we can use available tools (in finance &amp; tech) today to mitigate the incoming threats i.e poverty, lack of Individual sovereignty. According to Asindu, this was Daniels idea.
 So far, they have done a test run and will be ready to roll out very soon. We did a test run on the 7 of July 2018 and hopefully Episode one will come out in a few weeks, said Asindu.
 Also read: The rise of technology associations in Uganda
 Their plan is to release an episode a month with either one or both of them as the hosts.
 Asked if they are planning to monetize the podcast, he told me that thats not their current plan. The fear is around the likely conflict of interest. Given that podcasts are usually monetized through adverts.
 This is an entirely self-funded, hobbyist venture, Asindu pointed out. Noting that We currently will not take sponsorship to avoid conflicts of interest.
 For example, you simply cant expect us to give honest reviews on an MTN saga if they are the ones that pay for our lunch.
 Thats totally understandable. And, companies that might be willing to place adverts are usually the biggest players in an industry. But, in the end, to remain sustainable, questions about monetization will likely pop. The earlier they will be answered, the better.
 Asindu is a blockchain enthusiast while Daniel Mwesigwa is a researcher with CIPESA. He is also part of the team that started consumer tech platform  Dignited.
 If youd like to catch them once in a while, then keep checking here. Or, we might let you know when the first episode is out.

"Liquid Telecom and Sigfox partner to roll out IoT network to 85% of Kenya
","Liquid Telecom Kenya has partnered with Sigfox to roll out an IoT network to at least 85% of Kenya.
 Liquid Telecom Kenya has today announced a partnership with Sigfox to build and deploy a nationwide IoT network covering up to 85% of the Kenyan population, reads part of the press release.
 According to Liquid Telecom, this will see them set up new base stations that will be connected to their fibre network to deliver guaranteed reliability and speed. In the end, this should be able to connect sensors from all the different sectors.
 The IoT network will be used to connect sensors across all sectors, including agriculture and fishing, transport and logistics, utilities and energy, heavy industries, retail, and banking and insurance, wrote Liquid Telecom.
 Additionally, the network will also be used for smart cities projects and in wildlife conservation. Once completed, Liquid Telecom Kenya believes that the benefits from all the above will contribute towards the countrys Big Four Agenda.
 The Big Four Agenda is Uhuru Kenyattas second transformation agenda that has been narrowed to housing, security, affordable health-care, and manufacturing.
 Liquid Telecoms partner, Sigfox, is an IoT services provider with operations in at least 45 countries and have pioneered low cost, low energy consumption, long range IoT networks.
 This move will make Kenya the first country in the region to have a network that supports IoT. The introduction of a Sigfox Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is the first in the region, reads part of the press release.
 This implies that Kenyans can now be able to use IoT technology wherever they are which puts the country in a position to apply cost-effective local solutions using IoT.
 Also read: Africa’s Talking joins Open Banking Nigeria to develop open APIs for banking
 “We are building an LPWAN that will enable us to connect anything. Be it your car, dustbin, desk, soil, water, parking spot, water tank, street light, manhole, fridge or pet  just name it,” said Joel Muigai, Head of IoT Strategy at Liquid Telecom Kenya.
 “This network will allow Kenyans to develop our own homemade solutions for the many unique socio-economic and business challenges we face.”
 “For instance, why do we have to wait until a cholera case is reported for us to know there is a cholera outbreak? Why did we have to wait until 11 rhinos were dead for us to know the water was too salty?” asked Muigai.
 
 “With the new network we are building, we can connect our sewer lines and automatically predict when cholera is about to strike, with the exact location and time. We can connect rivers and water points in our parks and monitor the water quality to automatically raise the alarm if specified parameters are exceeded. These and many more solutions can now be a reality in Kenya using this network.”
 
 The new network will cost Kenyans as little as Sh100 ($1) per year per device or sensor, depending on usage.
 One important aspect that startups and innovators will find interesting is Liquid telecoms expression of willingness to work with them as they develop and deploy IoT solutions and innovations.
 To further promote development, Liquid Telecom Kenya will be working with incubator hubs and universities to enable students and startups to develop IoT solutions locally.
 This will be through initiatives like the one dubbed Go Things.
 As part of its Go Cloud initiative, which is designed to raise awareness, adoption, and usage of cloud-based services amongst startups in Africa, Liquid Telecom will also start a new initiative called Go Things that aims to accelerate IoT adoption in the region.

 This implies the telecommunications group is already contemplating rolling out the network to other regional markets like Uganda.

"Digital Impact Awards Africa, Digital and Financial Expo Back
","Based on Digital Impact Awards Africa (DIAA) research covering the digitalization of Africa and Financial Inclusion during the last 4 years, we predict that by 2025, embracing Digital Financial Services will drive 90% business success in Africa.
 Additionally, successful Sub-Saharan African companies will only be those with good web presence bundled with vibrant properties on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
 In monetary terms, the mobile ecosystem is projected to contribute USD160 billion to the GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 (GSMA 2015). McKinsey &amp; Company report that the internet will contribute USD300 billion to Africa’s GDP by 2025.
 
 Digital Financial Services will drive 90% Business Success in Africa
 
 Countries including Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and South Africa are not only among the fast-growing economies on the continent.
 But also the pillars of innovation and high-tech entrepreneurship leading the development of the digital economy in Africa.
 The digital driven financial evolution has brought about different tools to improve financial inclusion and change business models and payment models for different industries.
 While releasing the 4th Digital Impact Awards Africa nominees’ list, HiPipo CEO, Innocent Kawooya noted that “In order to maximize the digital dividend and minimize digitization risks, we recommend a bigger push for, regulatory adherence for SIM registration, Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering, Credit Reference Bureaus among others”.
 Adding that “We are at early stages of crossroads of Fintech, Regtech, and Financial Inclusion. We believe that the stakeholders have to embrace the opportunity and challenges presented by digital technology and regulations in order to effectively and collectively drive the financial inclusion agenda.”
 The Central Bank of Uganda (BoU) has shown the commitment of the government to prioritize the financial inclusion agenda.
 For instance, implementation of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy seeks to address five major drivers of financial inclusion; accessibility of financial services, credit infrastructure, digitization of financial services, appropriate and innovative financial products and consumer financial protection.
 Elsewhere, like in the United Kingdom, which would seemingly be a financially connected world, where people can send money to one another via smartphones. It’s pretty hard to believe that financial exclusion is still a reality there and has promoted the UK government to appoint the first Minister For Financial Inclusion.
 
 While RegTech is thought of as a sub domain of FinTech, the much-publicised $5.2bn fine (later reduced) levied against MTN Nigeria by the Nigerian Communications Commission for flouting SIM card registration regulations reminded the continent that regulation technology is very vital and will continue to be a very important player of effective and sustainable digital and financial inclusion   Kawooya
 
 Started in 2013 by HiPipo and developed under the patronage of Hon. Karubanga David, the 4th Digital and Financial Expo featuring Digital Impact Awards Africa, is scheduled for 21-22 September 2017 at Kampala Serena Hotel.
 The project includes an exhibition of innovations for products and services in the digital and financial services space and their application to the different economic sectors and industries such as agriculture, health, education, travel, hospitality, tourism, manufacturing, utility services etc.
 Various thought leaders will grace the project, Expo, and Awards event. These comprise C-Level executives, entrepreneurs, innovators, academic, consultants and policy makers.
 In 2016, DIAA recognized and appreciated the founders and pioneers of M-PESA who graced the #DIAA2016 event with delivering keynote remarks.
 These are Mr. Michael Joseph, Director Mobile Money at Vodafone and previously, the CEO of Safaricom Limited, Dr. Nick Hughes Co-Founder M-KOPA- Pioneer of M-PESA and Ms. Susie Lonie– Pioneer of M-PESA.
 In a research conducted by DIAA2017, 288 companies operating in Africa were assessed on how they embrace innovation. In this years awards, there are 9 categories that are eligible for companies operating across Africa.
 For these categories, several companies that have had highly commendable contribution to Africa digital and financial inclusion through innovations have been nominated following the research panel assessment and recommendations.
 The nominees have been at the forefront of innovation and applying best practice to steer digital inclusion and financial inclusion.
 Congratulation to all the DIAA 2017 nominees.  We look forward to have all the nominees and other players products and services exhibited during the project; expo, conference and awards event on 21-22 September 2017 at Kampala Serena Hotel.

"INTERVIEW: We have so far invested in 9 African ventures, including Uganda&#8217;s Numida &#8211; Rithu Rajan, EWB Ventures
","On December 7 and 8, Swarm Summit 2017 took place at The Square in Industrial. It featured several speakers on several panels dissecting issues hindering the building of a connected and robust technology and startup ecosystem in Uganda. Among the panel speakers at the summit was Rithu Rajan, an Investment Officer with EWB Ventures, currently scouting for investments in Uganda and Kenya.
 Rithu Rajan featured on the panel that discussed Building investible technology Startups in Uganda together with Oben Bate from Peppermint Holdings, Dustyn Winder from Akili VC, Lyndsay Holley Handler the CEO of Fenix International and Adedana Ashebir  who was on Skype  from Village Capital.
 We caught up with Rithu to understand more about EWB Ventures, the kind of investments they make, as well as how they plan to break away from investments based on pattern recognition. 
 Startup Digest Africa: Hi Rithu, that was a nice session. So, I wanted to understand more about EWB Ventures.  
 Rithu Rajan: EWB Ventures invests in social enterprises in Uganda, Kenya, Ghana and Côte DIvoire, and our ticket size ranges from $10,000 up to $100,000. Apart from financial investment, we also provide talent and advisory support. The talent support means providing staff for up to 2 years for critical roles in companies EWB Ventures has invested in. This is done to jump-start the company’s growth. In terms of advisory support, we work with a company to figure out strategic decisions around the business model, customer acquisition strategy, and fundraising strategy.
 SDA: Do you work with pre or post-revenue companies?
 RR: Both. Theres pre-revenue, some revenue and then some revenue but pre-break even. When we talk about revenue, we are not talking about big revenue. We are talking about less than $1,000 sometimes. Something just enough to show that your customers are willing to pay for your product and that you have done some groundwork for your product or service.
 SDA: You said that one of your forms of investment is through talent support, but we would like to understand, what is the role of an investor?
 RR: The role of an investor varies depending on whether they are an early-stage or late-stage investor. Early-stage investors, for example, are focused on building the business’ potential. They provide support to enable it to reach a growth such that it can either attract later-stage investors or be sustainable through its own operations. Sometimes, this support needs to be complemented through accelerators. They provide a condensed, intense level of support over three months to fill in the gaps that you might have on your team or in your business model. After that, a company is more investor ready.
 SDA:  Talking about accelerator programs, we are in a market where they are scarce. Those that get admitted have to go either to Nairobi, Cape Town or Lagos. Sometimes it is even expensive. How do you advise one to go about that?
 RR: What I would say is that there are some accelerators that will fund at least one of the co-founders to attend the accelerator program. This would include covering costs for the flight ticket, food and a hotel. Of course in an ideal world, I would say go through Ugandan accelerators but they are few. However, just because the closest ones are based in Nairobi, it doesnt mean that you should write them off.
 SDA: Lets talk about the investments EWB Ventures has made. And given that your ticket size ranges from $10,000 to $100,000. Whats the least and highest you have made so far?
 RR: Highest is $100,000 and the least has been $10,000. I cant talk about them specifically but can in general. So far, we have made 9 investments and one of them is based in Uganda. Most are right now based in Kenya actually. For example, M-Shule is an Education Technology company that provides an SMS-based learning solution for students in low-income schools. Our investment in Uganda, Numida, is a financial tracking app that helps SMEs keep digital records of their financial information.  Based on this information, Numida determines a credit score and then provides an unsecured loan to help the SME further grow their business.
 
 See also: Numida ranks #3 on the Startup Digest Africa Founders Top 10 2017 ranking of best tech startups in Uganda
 
 SDA: During the panel session, you talked about the issue of attitude. How often do you encounter individuals or entrepreneurs with a bad attitude?
 RR: Now and then I receive emails that read This would be the best opportunity in the world for you as opposed to being a little more flexible and saying Here is my pitch deck and I welcome any feedback. While we believe that entrepreneurs should be confident about their businesses, we also value openness to questions from investors. As investors, we’re not as familiar with your business as you are and thats why we ask a lot of questions so that we can learn about it.
 SDA: What do you think about the calls to investors to allow humanity to prevail when making some investments?
 RR: During the early negotiating process, if you dont understand the terms or rationale for certain clauses, ask us. One of the reasons institutional investors take a long time is not only the due diligence, it is also the negotiation. Theres a lot of back and forth. That back and forth varies depending on the company and whether they have access to a good lawyer. We absolutely encourage questions not only during the due diligence phase but also during negotiation.
 SDA: What do you think about supporting Angel Investors?
 RR: We are interested in engaging with angel investors. It has been challenging so far because we just started investing here and are just starting to attend events, do networking and engage with associations where there are angel investors. One way we can help build the startup ecosystem is by having a network of angel investors so that even if we are not able to invest in a company, we can refer them to other investors who may be interested. We are trying to be strategic in making those relationships happen as well.
 SDA: On the panel, you briefly talked about the reasons why you havent invested in as many Ugandan ventures as youd like. Could you break them down a little more?
 RR: We see a lot of exciting ventures in Uganda. The three main reasons we’re unable to fund these ventures though are lack of social impact, innovation or business model.
 Social impact is very specific to EWB Ventures. We are impact driven investors. Impact for us at the end of the day answers the question, How does your product or service meaningfully change the life of the person using it? Our focus is on reducing poverty and inequality. If the product does not contribute to that, it is not a fit for our fund but may be a good fit for another fund.
 For us, innovation is defined as either a product or service that has never been tried before or a significant improvement on a solution that already exists in the market.  You could have seen a solution thats already out on the market but isn’t working because of some flawed processes and you think You know what? I can take that same solution, and change it to make it better. That is innovation.  Many ventures we’ve rejected didn’t fit with this definition of innovation.
 Lastly, we see some interesting ideas that do not have a strong business or revenue model. For example, there might be a mismatch between the customer and the pricing, such as selling a UGX 1M product to someone who makes less than UGX 1,000 a day. That tells us that you didnt engage with your customers well enough to understand what they are willing or able to pay.
 These are the three main reasons we would turn down an application for funding.
 SDA: When you said that you invested in Numida  a team made up of foreign founders, it reminded me of the report by Village Capital talking about investments based on pattern recognition. What are you doing to break the pattern?
 RR: Absolutely, I read that report. And we have included internal Key Performance Indicators that take this into account. We are monitoring the percentage of local talent that we are investing in. It is not only local talent but the local talent in leadership positions as well. Whos making the executive decisions at the end of the day? We also monitor the number of female co-founders, since gender inequality is a big component of pattern recognition as well.
 We’re also broadening the channels we use to find investible companies.  This includes attending more events based in Kampala, engaging with local organizations or associations. By being part of these events, I hope that EWB Ventures will attract and then be able to invest in more local startups.
 SDA: To wind up, if a startup meets your requirements, how can they get to you? 
 RR: We are an open fund, which means that we accept applications all year round.  If you’d like to contact me,  you can email me at rithurajan@ewb.ca with a pitch deck to showcase how your venture is aligned with EWB Ventures’ focus on social impact and innovation. I’ll then get in touch with you to discuss whether your company is a good fit with our fund.

"Village Capital, PayPal Partner to Launch Their First Sub-Saharan Africa Investment-Readiness Program
","Village Capital launched the Village Capital Fintech Africa 2018 program in collaboration with PayPal. In an official communication on their website, the venture capital firm is seeking African startups in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania.
 Applications to the program opened last week on October 24, 2017 and will close on Friday, November 24, 2017. Click here to apply.
 Specifically, the program is looking for startups that address insurtech, pensions and savings, cooperative finance, and financial literacy; leverage data for credit scoring and consumer insights; and apply fintech to our other sectors of interest: agriculture, energy, education, and health.
 The cohort will consist of 10-12 early-stage fintech startups that will go through a three-month investment-readiness program, early next year.
 The startups will work through Village Capitals curriculum and engage with potential customers, strategic partners, mentors, investors, sector experts, and PayPal employees.
 At the end of the program, an offer of USD$50,000 investments will be awarded to the top two startups in the cohort, as selected by their peers. Details on the Village Capital peer-selected investment process can be found here.
 Village Capital has previously partnered with PayPal for the past three years to support entrepreneurs around the world that are working on improving financial health.

"What does DTB Boss Innovation Village Visit Mean for Uganda&#8217;s Startup Scene
","Last week, Varghese Thambi CEO of DTB Uganda, paid a courtesy visit to entrepreneurs and innovators at the Innovation Village in Ntinda. They showcased demos of their works while Varghese went on to break down how DTB Uganda is looking to become the bank for innovators and entrepreneurs.
 This visit was shortly followed by a visit by Maggie Kigozi on the 15th of July 2017. She was joining the Challenges World Wide and the team at the Innovation Village to celebrate the World Youth Skills day.
 What is even more interesting is that on the 19th of July, he will be coming back with his entire management team at DTB Uganda. This was revealed to us in a phone call with CK Japheth  co-founder of Innovation Village.
 Having these key figures at places where the youth are is one of the things majority of Ugandans, who wish innovation and entrepreneurship to thrive in this country, have longed for.
 Also read: E.A Incubators Should Push Young Entrepreneurs to Talk to “Real People” – GrowthAfrica CEO
 For long, theres been a very wide gap between the decision makers, policy makers, corporates and the government as well as the youth  especially innovators and entrepreneurs.
 One could attribute this to the fact that we dont believe in our own solutions. Yet this seems to be changing. We are, surprisingly, witnessing discussions being carried out on fair grounds rather than boardrooms where one side is at the mercy of the other.
 A year ago, having a bank boss visit a coworking space was more than a miracle. Yet, reports and write-ups like this one carried out on the future of fin-tech in Africa hint on the fact that fin-tech startups and banks must work together.
 The traditional businesses have the structures, the money, and customers while the startups have the ideas and innovations capable of disrupting the existing business models. So, what better way to have greater results than having the two synergize?
 Imagine the pace at which a startup will learn if given an opportunity by a bank like DTB to work shoulder to shoulder with its employees and teams to help them improve their products and processes?
 Instead of having to spend millions and millions to outsource an IT firm or individual from maturing ecosystems like India or Israel to give a half-baked solution, imagine having a team of local engineers who know the customers inside-out working on the problem for a fraction of the amount?
 This will not only lift the spirit of entrepreneurship but also ensure skills are developed. It will open doors to other companies giving the opportunity to young entrepreneurs by giving which in turn will result into perfecting their products. Plus,
 Plus, given that almost all sub-Saharan countries have the same or similar challenges, we might witness an increase in exports especially tech just like the case of Mobile Money. What a way out for a government that is struggling to find something it can tax.
 From my perspective, this is a very revolutionary gesture from DTB bank. We are waiting for more banks and companies to come on board. And, of course, our hope is that it results in something beyond just CSR.

"How international airtime top up is gaining ground in the African consumer market
","In 2014, Uganda’s Lawrence Zikusoka and Nigeria’s Ademola Adebolu founded Global ICT Solutions (GLICTS), East Africa. A fintech company that specialises in creating inclusive ICT and mobile financial services for growth and impact in emerging markets while delivering scalable and sustainable solutions.

 From the same author: Meet Uganda’s Bold in Africa, a home for African designers
 
 According to a report by World Bank, 1 in 7 Africans (112 million people) receives remittance from friends and family from abroad. This represents USD 60 billion yet Africans pay the highest transaction fees in the world.
 GLICTS East Africa was therefore founded to address the need of enabling people and SME customers in East Africa to instantly transfer small values to any mobile phones across borders at reduced transaction costs.
 Lawrence Zikusoka’s 15 years global experience in leading program and project management in innovative ICT, Telecom and Financial services across Asia, Africa and Middle East markets played a key role in conceptualizing the instant airtime transfers across East Africa and worldwide service.
 Klaus, who lives in Uganda is one of the people benefiting from the international airtime top up service which he uses to send money back home in Burundi
 To raise funds, GLICTS East Africa has since its inception relied on bootstrapping; receiving financial contributions from family and friends which amounts to USD 25,000.
 The founders used part of the funds to develop an international top-up gateway that is registered and protected by copyright and neighbouring rights with the Uganda Registration Services Bureau.
 GLICTS East Africa is also receiving in-kind technical assistance from the GrowthAfrica Accelerator Programme in Uganda. Lawrence’s advice to entrepreneurs is;
 
  “Start with as little money as possible and prove to yourself that your concept works then look at what scale would look like. Once you have the proof of concept there is a possibility to expand your services.”
 
 Customers can access the International Airtime Top Up™ service on the company’s website www.intlairtimetopup.com and with any mobile phone in the world using the unique International Top Up Card developed by GLICTS East Africa.
 Through the innovative top up card products, they are able to reach the under-served and unbanked segments thus reducing transaction costs on airtime transfer and remittance.
 GLICTS East Africa has also partnered with MTN Uganda and Airtel Uganda which makes it easier for Ugandan mobile money customers to make cross-border airtime top-ups.
 In addition, they have recently partnered with Interswitch East Africa and selected banks in Uganda – GT Bank, FINCA, NC Bank, Opportunity Bank, to enable banked customers to select the International Airtime Top Up™ option on the ATM menu to access this service and pay using their ATM bank card.
 They attribute word of mouth as the most effective go to market strategy so far. Though also leverage their distribution channels by working with their customers who become their agent network and play an invaluable role in sharing inputs on how they can improve their structures.
 Their unique impact story is of one Klaus who works at a great pizzeria in Lubowa, Uganda. He is able to send mobile top-ups to his sister back home in Bujumbura, Burundi from Uganda using International Top Up Card.
 GLICTS East Africa faces three main challenges. One is the lack of funds to hire the right staff. Two, pre-funding their merchant accounts and three, lack of capital investment for marketing the product. Though they also face the challenge of creating awareness for their product. To overcome this, they partnered recently with Jumia Travel to get access to some low-cost trip ads or targeted PR which is leveraged on Social Media.

"Silicon Valley investors should bet on Africa&#8217;s potential not exit history
","Yesterday, three individuals from Africas tech and startup space were on a panel Disrupt San Francisco in Silicon Valley. The team comprised of Tayo Oviosu (Paga), Ken Njoroge (Cellulant) and Fope Adelowo (Helios Investments Partners).
 Jake Bright, a TechCrunch contributor with a focus on Africa, moderated the panel [VIDEO]. In the half-hour session, he asked questions about the challenges and opportunities in Africa.
 One of his questions was about why Silicon Valley investors should pick interest in the continent. Despite the fact that theres no history of exits in form of IPOs.
 To somebody like a hardnosed VC from Silicon Valley, what would be the case to invest in Africa? Jake asked.
 All pointed out the market potential as the key value proposition.
 I think simply growth, Fope said. Adding that electronic transfer in Nigeria has grown by over 70% year on year in the last 5 years.
 
 That number is phenomenal and you can see that happening across other sectors. Thats the value proposition whether youre in Africa or looking at investments in Asia, youre looking at growth.
 
 Tayo Oviosu also said that the market potential is there. Though only those who are looking at playing the long-term game will benefit. The markets are so ripe and young for a long-term play, he said.
 Citing an example of Tim Draper, one of his earliest angel investors. Now close to 10 years down the road, Tim hasnt yet got a return on his investment. Though Tayo said that Tims investment has achieved a double-digit return to-date.
 I know we have more than 20x his money based on our last valuation and we will tell that story of the kinds of exits, Tayo said.
 Ken Njoroge, whose company has raised the largest amount so far this year, also pointed out the same by making reference to some of their recent figures.
 Last year, we processed about $2.5 billion and this year we are on track to process about $5 billion of payment volume in our network, Ken said. If you look at what investors look at, which is the size of the market and the quality of the teams. It is sheer market size.
 Yet, despite the opportunity, theres a multitude of challenges that African founders face.
 The macro environment that African startup founders face would make the toughest silicon valley founder cry and give up immediately, Jake pointed. Giving an example of a time when he visited Tayo and electricity went off. I am thinking of one time when I first met Tayo in his office in Lagos and the electricity just went out, he pointed out.
 Tayo also added that main challenge across many African countries is infrastructure. Talking about electricity, we now have a 24/7 call center, that means we are running a generator, he said.
 Despite, the infrastructural challenges, if one can brave them, theres the opportunity to make good returns.
 But what I say to people is that if you look at MTN, which is the largest mobile telephone company on the continent, they have the base stations and each has two generators. Yet they make $2 billion in profit just from Nigeria, Tayo said.
 Also read: Nigeria’s Paga closes a $10M Series B(2), looking at global expansion
 Aside from infrastructure, there are other challenges that are existent in the African market for startup founders. This includes the lack of a fully-formed ecosystem as well as the informal mentoring.
 Though Tayo pointed out that it is better than now than it was a few years ago.
 Because those of us that actually started 10+ years ago are now giving back, Tayo said. But a lot of those things make it very challenging to really run your business.
 Jake brought up the issue of corruption citing the startup battlefield incident.
 I saw there were African startups in the battlefield yesterday that were grilled on corruption, he said, before asking if theres a way corruption has impeded the threes ability to succeed.
 No, it hasnt, at all, Tayo said. Weve done business, we have never paid a single bribe, Ken added.
 Amidst all the challenges, the panel pointed out the difference between the startups that make it and those who dont.
 Ken said that the few businesses that survive have very very high-quality teams because it is that much more difficult an environment.

"5 Lessons for Entrepreneurs From Elon Musk’s Purpose Pursuit
","Elon Musk is a different breed of innovator and entrepreneur. Reading his biography, one cant fail to notice the definiteness of his purpose from early on as a boy. You can quickly tell he was gifted and talented specifically for what he is today.
 So, when he fantasizes intercity space shuttles transporting people from one city to another within an hour, he is within his force-field of purpose.
 I have come to realize that for the most part, we will ideate mostly about things that we are passionate about. The starting point of any success, therefore, is purpose in life.
 It would nearly be impossible for Elon Musk to achieve what he already has if there lacked a purpose. As one of the few people that have been able to stay truly focused on seeing their purpose through, theres more to admire and learn from him.
 Here are the top 5 lessons for entreprenuers looking to accomplish their purpose in life;
 
 
 Dream on Purpose
 
 
 Zig Ziglar once said: “People do not wander around and find their way on top of Mount Everest”. There has to be something that you are passionate about. Something that either is generated by the anger you have when things go wrong or the compassion you have to make things right.
 As an entrepreneur, you cannot afford to live without a purpose. Look within your field of talents, gifts or your heart and see what’s in there.
 For Elon Musk it was always something to do with space. It has never changed over the years. If anything, it is actually getting better. Believe me, chances are that one day we shall travel in rockets from one city to another in just under one hour.
 
 
 Dare to Push The Limits
 
 
 I remember reading an incident where Elon Musk and two or three friends went to Russia. They were looking to purchase low-cost rockets that they could use for space travel.
 They came back disappointed because the Russians mistreated them. However, while his friends were complaining during their flight back, Elon was busy punching in numbers in a spreadsheet.
 Shortly he announced to the crew: “We can actually build our own shuttle.” His friends looked at him as if he just got off a bus. Needless to say, Elon was so daring with his purpose that nothing would stop him.
 A great visionary once told me that one of the tests that you are on purpose is that people will either reject you or misunderstand you. Dare to stick it out anyway.
 As long as it matters to you and it is strong in your heart, stick with it. Keep looking, seeking, asking and knocking on doors of possibilities  until you find a way forward.
 
 
 Embrace the Mini Detours
 
 
 Elon’s main purpose is innovation in the way we travel. But that is not what he started with. His first startup was an online business directly called Zip2 before founding X.com which morphed into PayPal  that was sold for over $1.5 Billion to eBay.
 That was the break he needed before investing more than 70% of the millions of dollars he received from eBays acquisition of PayPal into SpaceX.
 At times in life, you will be forced to go on a tangent that is not necessarily your main passion. However whatever you do, you ought to give 200% excellence to it.
 It is normally the breeding ground or the rung for your next step. You get clout from what you have already done. If you were lousy in what you did because it wasn’t your main purpose, you will forever be known by that reputation.
 So learn to embrace the small detours that life inevitably gives you on your way to deploying your main purpose.
 
 
 Get started, Passion will follow
 
 
 Reading Elon Musk  the book, one is confronted with a machine-like pragmatic person who is not waiting for inspiration to come.
 I read somewhere, when someone said that “Inspiration is for amateurs, the rest of us we wake up and grind”.
 Honestly, if you are purpose oriented, you might not need to get passion from somewhere. Actually, one of the sickest things about humanity today is people who lack passion.
 The only passion we see is on weekends when people are supporting English Premier League soccer clubs.
 When Elon Musk wanted to build his own rockets, he did not have all the information. He just had one piece of information that was as crazy as it gets: It can be done. Let’s get this crazy (at least) with some of the ideas that we have.
 
 
 Stick It Out
 
 
 Tesla almost went bankrupt, only to be saved at the very last minute. Just because youre on a purpose does not mean you will have a smooth sailing.
 Un-explainable circumstances will test your patience to the limit. Your goal is to stay as persistent as possible.
 In all the projects that Elon Musk has undertaken  from Zip2 to now SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity  there has been none he pulled off without a massive dose of persistence. In some cases, he has been ousted as CEO of his own companies.
 Purpose is an incredible force with two dimensions to it: Knowing it and working it. Elon Musk is someone we all need to emulate especially on the part of working on our purpose.

"What Angel Investors Look for in a Startup in Uganda
","It is estimated that up to 80% of startups do not reach their fifth anniversary. In the case of Uganda, 50% of businesses do not reach their third anniversary. 
 Various reasons are cited for a startup’s failure including a lack of capital or cash to burn. Therefore, to this end, it is very important that a startup is able to attract capital or investors early.
 While as an investment in startups includes family and friends who may invest because of emotional and social support reasons, theres a need to attract the next type of investors, Angel Investors, who are the bridge to Venture Capital investors and are usually the first experience a startup gets of financial investors. 
 For Angel investors, investing in a startup is driven by the need to make a financial return over and above any social and emotional reasons. Therefore, the aim of identifying suitable startups to invest in for angel investors is to pick those with the greatest chance of success. 
 What, then, do Angel Investors look out for and what should startups demonstrate to increase their chances of success and thus become more attractive to Angel investor funding?
 The Idea
 It is important that there is a clear demonstration of the pain point being addressed by the Startup. Is there a clear need and more importantly is the idea scalable? 
 Generally, Angel Investors will look more favorably on an idea that creates a new market and or provides a new way of solving a problem or taps into a very large unfulfilled need as opposed to an idea that tries to steal market share from existing players.
 Product /Market Fit
 For the startup with a product or solution addressing a need, is there a clear product market fit? Has this been found? Product/market fit simply means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market. 
 An Angel Investor looks for a startup that is able to demonstrate product/market fit quickly! This is seen as the first step to building a successful venture in which the startup or a company meets early adopters, gathers feedback and gauges interest in its product(s).
 Founder Focus, Passion and Tenacity
 While anyone can think of an idea, does the entrepreneur have the passion and tenacity to see this idea through to the end? Entrepreneurship can be a lonely journey and one will face a lot of obstacles as they try to show the whole world their amazing product and why it is the next best thing. 
 Angel Investors look out for startup founders that demonstrate resolute focus and determination every day to break through barriers and challenges in pursuit of the goal and furthering their idea.
 Team Alignment and Fit
 In the world of startups, Angel Investors would rather a grade B idea with a grade A team than a grade A idea with a grade B team. 
 More importantly, is the team executing on the idea a good fit? Are they aligned in their interests and objectives? Angel investor shall look at the skill sets within the team, look for levels of commitment within the team and if the possible clear contractual alignment of objectives.
 For example, as demonstrated in shareholder agreements or a memorandum of understanding with clear roles, responsibilities, and milestones for each member of the team. It is advisable to have an Advisory Board in addition to the team executing on the idea.
 Team excellence in execution
 After the startup has chosen their idea and is clear for whom they are solving what problem, also known as a value proposition, Angel Investors will look out for excellence in delivery as a team towards this value proposition.
 While ideas for startups may not be unique, to ensure success, startups should have identified a clear need or problem that their idea solves that is sustainable. To do this shall require a quick understanding and demonstration of the product market. 
 For the vision that the entrepreneur has to be realized shall require passion and tenacity on the part of the Founder who shall need to demonstrate character and strength of mind to take their idea/business forward. 
 To improve the chances of success and the ability to execute on the idea, there is a need for a team that is aligned with their objectives and includes the diversity of skills.

"The rise of technology associations in Uganda
","There’s no doubt Uganda’s technology scene is on an upward trend. Despite little or no government support at both policy and investment level. The upward trend has happened in the last decade. With the first half being the one where the fundamental infrastructures were built.
 Notable players in the first half of the decade were innovation hubs and centers. Some of them like Outbox, Hive Colab and Design Hub (formerly The Hub Kampala) have stood the test of time. While others like Mara Launchpad, Grameen Foundation etc, fell off the wagon.
 But, in the second half, a new breed of enablers has emerged. Associations. These have started sprouting from everywhere at a spiraling rate.
 First was BICU, an association for innovation hubs and centers in Uganda. It launched in 2012 before folding and making a comeback last year.
 Although founded in 2013, the ICTAU was largely dormant in its initial years. Until recent years after it took shape.
 The Fintech Association of Uganda followed last year. And was pioneered in August last year by Financial Sector Deepening Uganda. To sum up the club, before the end of last year, the Blockchain Association of Uganda was also formed.
 Related: Here’s why Ugandan hubs are coming together
 Like all associations, these are also being formed to serve as a collective voice. One they can use to lobby, influence as well as achieve other benefits that come with an industry being represented in an organized way.
 Richard Zulu, the chairman of BICU  in an interview earlier this year  told me that the main reason the hubs came together was to see that as “players supporting entrepreneurship [they] collectively have a common voice that promotes advocacy and visibility.”
 As the innovation sector in Uganda has evolved to become a leading source of hope for youths, many are coming up with ventures leveraging existing technology or the next wave of technologies.
 They thus need protection, a voice as well as a favorable environment. These is especially in regards to the government. Given there’s a past history of policies that are not innovation-friendly.
 For example, ICTAU, the body that unites the ICT community in Uganda came out to criticize the governments decision to levy 1% on mobile money transactions as well as the UGx. 200 charge to access OTT services.
 It is through such associations that many can find the protection, voice as well as lobbying for a favorable environment.
 Another example is the Blockchain Association of Uganda. According to Kwame Rugunda, it resulted from blockchain focused companies in Uganda wanting to seek validation from the central government. Yet no one was willing to listen to individuals. Hence the move to package themselves as an association.
 All the associations admit individuals, companies, institutions and any other players in the innovation space. Though, they require one to subscribe in order to become a member. Fees aren’t uniform. For example, ICTAU charges UGX. 100,000 for an individual annual membership. While the members of the Fintech Association of Uganda part with around UGx. 3,500,000 per year.
 How much these associations have contributed to the innovation space is yet to be quantified.
 Though, the Blockchain Association of Uganda was behind the recently concluded Africa Blockchain Conference. This attracted the president of Uganda, other key figures in the Ugandan government and Binance’s Changpeng Zhao.

 While the ICTAU has been pivotal in engaging government MDAs especially the Ministry of ICT as well as NITA-Uganda. The Fintech Association, as well as BICU, are taking shape slowly by slowly.

"5 Things that Will Be Game Changer in the Ugandan Startup World
","Of course it is debatable that Uganda is the most entrepreneurial county in the whole wide world. The question is: What shows? Let me give some perspective. A friend of mine was in the presence of a Venture Capitalist in Dubai. He is Ugandan and he was seeking partnerships especially in regards to funding local startups.
 This friend was asked one question by the Venture Capitalist: How many Ugandan Startups have created products or services that have served the East African region? How many Startups have received funding to scale their products to reach the entire country and the rest of the countries in the region?
 As you might imagine, the answers to these questions are not easily forthcoming. If they are, please notify us in the comment section below. Now, this is not to cast a shadow on what is happening in the startup ecosystem in Uganda. Actually there are some exciting things that are going on in Uganda for the past five or so years in our startup world.
 We have over 10 “Hubs” and co-sharing ‘spaces’ that are fostering the entrepreneurship spirit. We see more and more schools, including primary school kids participating in different challenges on innovation and conceiving exciting products. This to me is the beginning of birth pangs. It is characterized however with some things that need to be addressed. Indeed, I have already shared elsewhere that “App Development is not Innovation”.
 I believe that the following five pillars would be extremely crucial in shaping and changing the Startup world in Uganda for the better:
 
 Long Term Thinking
 
 Now that we are all over the place trying to do this and that, it would be prudent at some point to hit the brakes, take a chill pill, halt all the traffic and ask ourselves this question: Whatever it is I am developing, what are the prospects of its legacy 100 years from now?
 We will create great products to the degree that we have thought through this question. In fact, if we cannot answer this question then it means that the foundation upon which we are standing as entrepreneurs and creators is shaky, reactive, myopic, immediate-term and largely propelled by the chase of the almighty dollar.
 Long term thinking is no mean feat. I mean, sitting down and coming up with a 100-300 year business of personal plan is no mean feat. But that is the stuff that will create a spine of excellence, responsiveness and versatility of our inventions. We need to be thinkers, period! Gone are the days of thriving in a “me too” economy.
 If we are to have a game-changing startup world, we must of necessity think not just big, but think very extremely longterm.
 
 Export a Startup.
 
 I had an opportunity to speak recently to a group of young men and women who had just joined a prestigious High School in Kampala. In a group of 200 students, you could hear their lingo. A kid says, “Oba what?” Another one, “Stop telling me that naawe”. Well of course this is Uganda and we are allowed to use our mother tongue as we converse, mixing it with English!
 But hey, it needs to stop there. Our thinking (there it is again) has to start crossing the borders. What Ugandan startup has crossed the borders? Is there potential of such like startups in our ecosystem? I think so. So in raising this point, my focus is on entrepreneurs in Uganda to start targeting the East African Market which has been recently opened.
 This is possible these days. We have seen foreign “startups” invading our land. We have seen restaurant chains such as Burger King and KFC enter our markets. We have also seen other regional “startups” such as Nakumatt entering our markets.
 We need to make a mark and export a startup at least, if you know what I mean. If we will continue thinking in our districts or just around Kampala, we will be left behind.
 
 Break Culture
 
 I will say it again. It is bizarre for Ugandans to continue proudly quoting this: “It takes 4 Ugandans to do what 1 Kenyan can”. That finding by some UN body has been repeated to me over and over again for the past 7 years since I first encountered it. A coaching practitioner colleague of mine has written a book around this phenomenon after over 20 years of research.
 Listen, what is happening in the corporate world cannot be transferred in the Startup world in Uganda and we expect to cause ripples. Let me give you a picture. Take a tour of those 10 “Hubs” I mentioned above any working day…or even weekend. How many people will you find there actually working and grinding on their products?
 Look at advertisements of events, trainings and meetups in the startup ecosystem in Uganda. Check out the quality in terms of content, attendance, engagement and follow up. There is a generally agreed sentiment of laziness and that won’t cut it in the startup world.
 Of course there are pockets of extremely hard working individuals out there who are burning the candle on both sides and I appreciate them. We need to make such a habit our culture.
 
 Collaboration
 
 This has to become real, not just in word. There are great people and organizaitons out there in the startup world that are individually doing their own thing. Like that famous song about personal lights goes:
 This little light of mine, I am gonna let it shine x3
 Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine!
 We need those little lights to join and blow up the biggest flame this side of the world has ever seen in the startup world. Working alone in our own corners will not cut it. This is a massive topic that I would have to probably jot an independent article about. I had an opportunity to have a one-on-one with Geoffrey Ssemaganda of Action wealth one day.
 He was totally against this thing of “dominating your market” He said that these days, people work in collaborations. Instead of people competing, why can’t they harmonize their strengths, join their efforts and collaborate? At some level, competing comes from the mentality of scarcity.
 
 Excellence
 
 We have to be proud of what we are creating…and for that to happen, we need to have a spirit of excellence on it. Kind David said,
 “Aint standing on a platform to offer anything to my God that cost me nothing”
 In other words, we have to pay the price for excellence. Mediocrity should be banished from the startup ecosystem in Uganda. This does not just mean quality and finesse, but it also means honoring out deadlines, plans and agreements. If we are to accelerate our growth, we must be men and women of honor inherently. It starts from within. If we lack honor, then it is easy to roll out cheap lackadaisical products. Our focus cannot just be to finish or to “close”, our focus has to be of legacy, impact and value.
 &nbsp;
 I believe that if these 5 things are put in place, Uganda will really be the greatest entrepreneurial country in the whole wide world.

"7 Ugandan Apps to Have On Your Smartphone
","Smartphone penetration in Uganda has been on the rise for a number of years now and we wanted to highlight a number of Ugandan apps that we encourage all of you to install and experience. These apps are designed for a series of purposes like social, utilities, tourism, entertainment, financial services and many others.
 Our criteria for selecting these apps are as follows; they must have been fully or mostly developed by a Ugandan, should be highly compatible to the indigenous lifestyle, they must be relatable and be able to create a market place for the local Ugandan. In no particular order, here are our picks;
 GetMo; In case you are balling on a budget, GetMo is the ultimate app to help you look up all the coolest places around town that have the latest promotional offers. These range from bars, restaurants, lounges, accommodation, clubs and pretty much anything that is happening around town.
 
 Matatu; This app is basically a digital rendition of the common game of cards most people used to play as children right up to today. Just like its physical version, it is also highly addictive and lots of fun especially the fact that it makes it possible to play online with players from around the world. This app is the  most downloaded game app in Uganda and definitely for good reason.
 Fezah; This app enables people to book their favorite or desired artistes, bands or Djs for various events. Based on the day of your event, you are able to see which artistes are available for you to pick from, you can even compare performance fees between artists to see  which best fits your budget.
 
 To help users who maybe on the fence about going with a particular artist, the app also enables them to listen  to samples of the artists content as well as watch them perform at past events. To top it all up, you can check the ratings of the artists from other people who have actually booked them through the app to make sure you select the best.
 Yoza ; this app has actually gotten a lot of international recognition based on how innovative it is. It pairs users with people close to their area that can help them do their laundry for a fee ofcourse.
 The washers are vetted right from the LC1 level which ensures security on the users end. The app also partners with laundry marts incase a user needs dry cleaning. It is currently available in Kampala only however.
 Recipe Uganda; this app is like a food directory, it’s a compilation of local and staple foods in and around Uganda. In addition, it also has detailed descriptions and ingredients needed to prepare all these local food recipes. You will not regret having Recipe Uganda if you are a foodie, a cook, a chef or just a traveler.
 Safe Boda; the safe boda team has recently stepped up its game with the Safe Boda app. It provides an easier way to get a safe ride back around the city. Users just have to place their current location, their destination, request for a boda and the app pairs them with the closest safe boda along with a fee for the journey.
 Boda Boda’s are famous for having reckless riders so this app is a definite life saver since their riders are trained and vetted.
 Pearl Guide App; this app gives a detailed coverage of all the best Ugandan attractions,outdoors, amenities, and events. With its practical advice on what to experience while in Uganda, the pearl guide app ensures a memorable experience in The Pearl of Africa.
 
 There are so many Ugandan apps out there that haven’t made it to this list so we would like to encourage you to show some support to our home grown Ugandan app developers by downloading some if not all of these apps and others out there.

"These are the leading Ugandan accelerator programs
","When you look at the growth in a number of hubs as well as the growth in the amount of funding raised over the past few years, though it has become sort of a cliche, there’s no doubt Ugandas startup scene is rising and rising.
 Yet, despite the upward growth, startups still face a couple of challenges. Ranging from funding to mentorship. However, there are now a couple of programs cropping up that are helping tackle the mentorship issue.
 As a startup founder, especially, there are a lot of benefits you can get from joining an accelerator program. Thats why weve curated a list for you.
 1. Unreasonable East Africa
 One of the most consistent accelerators in Uganda, Unreasonable East Africa, UEA, offers a full-time 10 months programme. It focuses mainly on post revenue businesses with no bias towards any industry. Though, their program is a good fit for social businesses.
 Since 2013, UEA has worked with 37 businesses across East Africa, who have raised US $15 million funding and have created over 1000 jobs. Their offices are located in Ntinda.
 2. GrowthAfrica
 Though headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, GrowthAfrica maintains an office in Uganda, too. The office is located at The Innovation Village in Ntinda. This means that they are now able to offer their program in Uganda.
 Like Unreasonable, GrowthAfrica focuses on post-revenue businesses only. They have so far run 14 cohorts with entrepreneurs participating. According to GrowthAfrica, 152 startups have been accelerated to date and raised over US $44 Million in the process.
 The program isnt biased towards any sector. Admitting startups from agribusiness, ICT, Healthcare &amp; Wellness, clean &amp; greentech, manufacturing and more. Though, looking at their portfolio, Agribusiness and IT companies tend to be favored.
 3. Inccelerate
 Inccelerate is a fusion between an incubator and accelerator. The program takes on individuals with or without ideas. These are then grouped and encouraged to work on an idea that can culminate in a startup. It was launched by Enstartup late last year.
 Upon its launch, it took on its first cohort that will graduate this year. The program is suitable for recent university undergraduates who are looking to explore starting up. Or, if you are in your initial stages of starting up. Plus, they also offer you US $10,000 worth of resources for three months. They are located in Ntinda.
 4. Imuka Ventures
 Imuka Ventures is a social business learning accelerator program. A look at the programs portfolio implies that it is suitable for post-incubation startups or SMEs. Though, it focuses mainly on those with a social impact. Imuka is located at Makerere University.

"Uganda tech startups raise USD 16 Million, as Africa hits a record USD 560 Million
","Partech Ventures has released its funding report for the African tech startup scene for the year 2017 and there are some really exciting figures and trends.
 The report, which sums up all the VC funding activities across the continent, indicates that African tech-startups raised in the region of USD 560 Million in funding for the year 2017. This represented a 53% year over year growth or 1.53x compared to the amount raised in the year 2016.
 The same report also indicates that Uganda raised USD 16 Million which is over 50x more than the amount reported by the same report last year for the year 2016.
 Going by the figures in the report, a lot of wild positive growth can be seen in both the leading and emerging ecosystems on the continent. Though, despite a growth in the funding raised by tech startups in the leading ecosystems of South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya, their total percentage contribution to the continental figure dropped from 81% to 76%.
 South Africa, which at 42 had the most number of deals raised the highest total funding with USD 167.9 Million. This was followed by Kenya with 25 deals worth a total of USD 147 Million in funding and Nigeria which had 17 deals that were worth USD 114.6 Million.
 Uganda came in at number seven with only 5 deals that were worth only USD 16 Million. This is a huge leap for Uganda seeing that the country was number 12 in the report released last year for the year 2016.
 When it comes to the sectors, the report says that the top three verticals remain Off-Grid Tech, Fintech &amp; E/M/S-Commerce, attracting 61% of the total funding, down from 72% in 2016.
 Though off-grid tech had a 10% decline in year over year funding, it still retained the top spot with $120 Million. This was closely followed by Fintech at USD 119 Million which experienced over 70% year on year growth.
 However, it should be noted that there was USD 117 Million that went to off-grid in form of debt that wasnt included since the report doesnt track debt, grant or ICO funding.
 The report also highlighted a growth in the deal sizes. It pointed out that Africas series A deal size reached USD 4.5 Million in 2017 from USD 3.7 Million in 2016.
 Similarly, Seed+ funding round size rose from USD 0.83 Million to 0.91 Million in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Lastly, Series B round size experienced a decline from USD 11.1 Million to USD 10.5 Million in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
 Although there are some consistencies reported about funding in the African tech scene in both the Disrupt Africa and Partech Ventures reports, there has been some disparities. Especially in the total funding figures.
 For example, both reports indicate a declining combined share of the leading markets as well as the fact that funding increased by over 50%, yet, the actual figures wildly differ.
 There is a debate on which figures to quote or go by seeing that both Partech Ventures and Disrupt Africa release funding reports. For example, in January last year, Disrupt Africa reported that African tech startups had raised an estimated USD 185.7 Million. While Partech Ventures reported that they had raised an estimated USD 366 Million in funding.
 There is a USD 181 Million disparity in the two figures reported by the two companies. Similarly, this year, Disrupt Africa report that African tech startups raised an estimated $195 Million in funding. While as Partech Ventures has reported USD 560 Million. Again, theres a USD 371 Million disparity in the two figures reported.
 Part of the explanation as to why this is occurring is perhaps the differing methodologies employed in the analysis. Another critical difference stems from how each of them defines an African startup. Partech Ventures treats an African tech startup as ones having their primary market in Africa in Africa.
 Therefore, their definition focuses on operations and revenue and independent of Headquarters location or country of incorporation. Furthermore, Partech Ventures doesnt track deals lower than USD 200,000 as well as those above USD 100 Million know as Megadeals. They also exclude any grants, debts and ICO deals.

"How to use blockchain technology to unlock real estate potential in Uganda
","Uganda is recognised as having a complex land tenure system. With a number of land tenure systems including freehold, leasehold, private mailo, customary freehold and crown land, all sometimes existing within the vicinity of each other.
 In addition to having a complex land tenure system, the land administration process including land registration and titling, land sale/purchase and conveyancing is also complex and subject to fraud, corruption and errors with resulting inefficiencies in collection of taxes and dues and challenges in maintaining a secure land registry, uncertainty in land and property rights.
 This is a reflection of and exacerbated by poor controls and governance within the organisations and communities responsible for overseeing land be they public or private lands. The challenges with Uganda’s land administration process have been well documented including by the ongoing Land Inquiry Commission headed by Hon. Lady Justice Catherine Bamugemereire.
 For example, according to Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD), as of 2016 approximately 19% of land in Uganda is held under freehold tenure, approximately 45,800 sq km.
 For freehold tenure, Uganda uses the ‘Torrens’ system of land registration. The Torrens system was designed to provide certainty as to title since it requires duplicate documentation be held by a central office, and by the rightful owner of the land.
 Transactions should only take place when the two documents are seen together. In practice, evidence has shown the application of the system in Uganda is not foolproof, with problems of fraudulent documents as well as a poor system of land records which contribute to inefficiency and lack of transparency in land administration with incidences of more than one title for the same piece of land being common.
 Furthermore, information from the Uganda Legal Information Institute shows that there is a high prevalence of cases linked to land fraud in the courts and legal system. According to Liz Neates The lie of the land released in June 2017, over the period 2011 – 2016, cases related to land fraud accounted for on average 10% of all cases coming to the courts.
 However, these challenges are not unique to Uganda with similar challenges being identified in other jurisdictions such as Ghana, Honduras, Brazil, India and the UK where cases of an inefficient land administration process and land and title registry fraud are either rampant and or on the increase. With land recognized as a key investment asset and core to identity and community.
 In addition, right to and protection and validity of property rights are key to doing business in any economy. Is it not time the challenges with Uganda’s land administration process got resolved once and for all?
 There is a case for using blockchain technology in the land administration process. At the very heart of blockchain technology through its distributed ledger technology and consensus protocols is a set of rules and checks that inherently help reduce fraud, corruption and error while streamlining the collection of taxes and maintaining a secure land registry all at a reduced cost compared to existing centralized solutions.
 Fortunately, blockchain technology is already being applied to the land administration process with solutions being piloted and explored elsewhere globally, some examples include:
 Bitland: Streamlines and automates the entire land registration process so it provides a better system of record. Bitland combines automation with blockchain technology. Bitland is currently piloting in Kumasi, Ghana with plans to scale globally.
 Related: Here’s how Blockchain technology is fixing what the internet had failed.
 Ubitquity: Based in Delaware, USA and offer the ability to securely recording and tracking property with a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) blockchain platform to provide a clean record of ownership, reduce future title search time, increased confidence and transparency. Ubitquity is currently piloting with the Land Records Bureau in Brazil.
 Suyo: A social enterprise based in Colombia and formed out of a project under Mercy Corps and funded by Omidyar Network. Suyo offer property formalization services to low-income families in Colombia including a property assessment with a mobile app, legal and technical analysis, case preparation and all of the corresponding governmental clearances and transactions at a fraction of standard market rates.
 Chromaway: Use a ‘Postchain’ or the consortium database, combines the power and flexibility of mature database systems with the secure collaboration and disruptive potential of blockchain. ChromaWay has previously piloted a real-estate blockchain project in Sweden and is currently trialling the blockchain in India.
 Dubai Land Department: Dubais land registrar is developing a system that would seek to record all local real estate contracts on a blockchain as part of overseeing land purchases and approving real estate trades. The project is part of a plan to secure all government documents on a blockchain by 2020.
 Reviewing some of the applications of block chain to real estate highlighted above, it is clear that adopting blockchain technologies may be a solution to the land administration challenges in Uganda and also unlock wider potential through efficiencies in the real estate value chain.
 Any blockchain solution would have to work with and complement the existing land registry processes and ongoing reforms especially under the National Land Information Survey (NLIS) project under the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD) here but look to use blockchain technology to improve the governance, controls and approvals required in a decentralized and transparent manner and at scale working across the various stakeholders involved including the Land Registry, Uganda Revenue Authority, MLHUD, banks/financial institutions, landowners, landlords and trustees among others.
 The implementation of a blockchain for the land administration process would have to be designed to ensure benefits are maximized including speed up of transactions, reduction in paper work, reduction in fraud and transaction costs. On this real estate blockchain backbone can be built other services linked to property and real estate such as collection of rental incomes, payment for utilities and bills associated with properties, asset management, renovations and repairs, title deed insurance, collateralized financing, investment property, etc.
 By adopting blockchain technology for real estate, not only will we address current bottle necks but one can also scale and optimize the real estate value chain.

"These are Africa&#8217;s top 19 funding rounds in 2018 (so far)
","Theres no doubt that funding in Africas tech startups is on the rise. That on its own is exciting. Yet, what is more, exciting is that the deal amounts are also going up every day. Additionally, we are seeing indigenous founders also receive funding in increasing frequency and amount.
 Below, we take a look at the top 19 deals that have been made into startups in Africa since the beginning of the year. Together, they have a combined total of $441 million.

"African Development Bank invests €7M in Partech Africa Fund
","The African Development Bank  ADB  has approved the investment of €7 million into Partech Africa fund. The decision was made on Thursday by the Bank’s executive directors. According to ADB, this is part of their efforts to channel critical investment funding to Africa’s entrepreneurs.
 Partech is a Venture Capital Fund dedicated to investing in tech-enabled, innovative, high growth potential and talented entrepreneurs operating early stage companies and applying relevant technologies to address fundamental market constraints with the potential to scale across the continent.
 According to papers presented to the ADB Board, the Fund has successfully completed its first close in January 2018 with €71 million and is targeting a total fund size of at least €100 million through a 2nd round expected to be closed by October/November 2018.
 PROMOTED: Find out how Unreasonable East Africa can support your business
 This recent investment from ADB, therefore, brings their total raised to around €79 million.
 Under the framework of the Boost Africa Program, the Bank will provide  €7 million equity investment in the 2nd close.  The contributions from both the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank form part of the Boost Africa Programme, which assists Partech in its fundraising.  The Bank is expected to have a seat in the Advisory Board of the Fund.
 According to ADB, the fund’s focus aligns well with the Boost Africa objectives to invest in high growth innovative start-ups.
 ADB states that Partech has hubs/offices in Dakar, Nairobi, and Lagos. They are also targeting nine Sub-Saharan African countries. These include; South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Senegal, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.
 In an interview with How We Made It in Africa, Tidjane Deme, who co-leads the Partech Africa Fund, said that ‘investing in Africa cannot be done from New York or London’. Adding that they are traveling 10 days per month across the continent. This perhaps explains why they are setting up a couple of local hubs.
 Since announcing the fund, the Partech Africa fund has gone on to make a couple of bets in African startups. In September, they led South Africas Yocos $16 million Series A. A figure that is among the top 17 funding rounds of 2018 so far.
 However, in May, they had already made their first investment when they led Nigeria-based TradeDepots $3 million Series A.

"African Leadership Academy raised $28M Series B from Omidyar Network
","African Leadership Academy (ALA), a South African education institution, raised a further $28.19 million Series B last year. The amount came from long-time funder  Omidyar Network. ALA raised the amount mid last year, according to their SEC filings done in July 2018.
 The filing is under African Leadership (Mauritius) Ltd, the holding company. Fred Swaniker, ALA CEO and Co-founder, is the signatory, together with Costa Arjuna, a director.
 ALA has raised funding through three disclosed funding rounds, all from Omidyar Network.
 The first was a $1.5 million grant which the Omidyar Network announced in May 2011. A $23.51 million Series A followed in April 2016 according to the SEC filing. In total, the academic institution has raised at least $53.2 million in disclosed funding.
 The academy was founded in 2008 by Acha Leke, Chris Bradford, Fred Swaniker and Peter Mombaur.
 ALAs goal is to transform Africa by developing a powerful network of over 6,000leaders. To-date, they boast 1180 young leaders in their network. These come from at least 46 countries and have started a total of 177 ventures.
 Education is an important sector. But, it has not received the much-needed attention across Africa. Despite the World Bank saying that the continent has made considerable progress in boosting primary and lower secondary school enrollment.
 
 The same bank adds that at least some 50 million children remain out of school. Most of those who attend school are not acquiring the basic skills necessary for success later in life.
 
 In the end, the continent has a problem of a low-quality labour force that cant compete in the labour market.
 But, theres a couple of initiatives one can point at. In 2017, Jamie Martin founded Injini, an only education technology-focused accelerator/incubator. So far, they have accelerated 15 startups and invested over $500,000 into them.

 In November last year, UNICAF, which calls itself the largest online higher education platform in Africa, announced a $28 million Series B financing. The funding was to help them meet the growing demand for high-quality university education across the continent.
 Goldman Sachs led the round with participation from existing investors. These include; CDC Group, leading higher education fund University Ventures, and EDEX.
 Yet, despite all this, funding into educational technology and initiatives is still lacking. Especially when compared to other sectors like financial technology and e-commerce.

"SafeBoda&#8217;s Rapa Thomson Ricky named by Forbes among &#8220;30 Most Promising Young Entrepreneurs In Africa 2018&#8221;
","Forbes has today released its list of the most promising young entrepreneurs in Africa for the year 2018. And, Rapa Thomson Ricky, a 29-year-old co-founder of Ugandas ride-hailing startup, SafeBoda, was on the list.
 According to Forbes, Ricky has been instrumental in growing Safeboda into a large community of over 1,000 riders who have come to embrace technology through the SafeBoda app.
 A former security guard at Akamwesi, a students hostel, Rickys life turned around the moment he decided to quit and venture into boda-boda riding.
 I joined the boda-boda industry as a rider, and this was like graduating from a degree to Masters, he told Jump in an interview. Adding that It was a dream job for me as Ricky.
 However, he quickly found challenges in the unregulated industry and decided to do his business in a way that challenged the norm. Especially after he lost his friend  a fellow boda-boda rider  to an accident.
 But I found so many challenges; I lost one of my very good friends who died in a Boda accident! I learnt [sic] that both my passengers and I needed to wear helmets. So I took a step and bought a second helmet for my passengers to wear and a much better quality one for myself, Ricky said.

 Luckily enough, he met Maxime DIeudonné, now a fellow co-founder, who was working with One Acre Fund in Uganda. Together, they decided to launch SafeBoda.
 I met Max through a friend who I had shared the SafeBoda idea with, Ricky said in the interview.
 When I met Max, he asked me about the industry and I shared my dream of connecting the riders with the customers using a call center but he advised that it would be a better idea to use an app.
 Since then, the startup founded in 2015, has grown to become a force to reckon in the East African ride-hailing market. Especially after the recent expansion to the Kenyan market.
 According to SafeBodas CrunchBase profile, the startup has raised north of US $200,000 in funding. Though, it is believed that they have raked in more when you add the grants and other non-disclosed amounts in funding.
 In its seventh year, the Forbes annual ranking of the 30 Most Promising Young Entrepreneurs In Africa features some of the most exceptional young innovators and disruptors in African business today.
 According to   Mfonobong Nsehe, an African-based Forbes contributor who curates the list, these 30 were chosen from more than 650 nominations sent via email, researched by a small team and vetted by a panel of expert A-list judges to make sure they’re deserving of a spot. 
 However, it is worth noting that the list only had 28 names with Nigeria and Tanzania taking the lead. Each contributed 9 and 7 young entrepreneurs on the list respectively.
 While as the list is published as 30 under 30 elsewhere, it is not the case for Africa. For example, Nigerian-born Temitope Ogunsemo, 33, the founder of Krystal Digital, was also on the list. Though, the list was largely dominated by young entrepreneurs 30 years and below.

"Kenya&#8217;s FarmDrive Receives Additional Investment Led By Existing Backer
","FarmDrive (FD), a Kenyan startup set to unlock millions of dollars in loans for smallholder farmers in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa, received a follow-on investment from EWB Canada last month, with participation from AK IMPACT INVESTORS, 1 to 4 Foundation, ADAP SEED FUND 2 and The Lakes Charitable Foundation.
 This FinTech startup founded by two Kenyan women is positioned to reach 3 million smallholder farmers in Kenya in the next 5 years. The two co-founders, Peris Bosire and Rita Kimani, aim to deliver productive digital loans and layaway savings products to smallholder farmers (SHFs) to grow their incomes and resilience. Using a combination of agriculturally relevant data, Know Your Customer data, and advanced behavioural analytics, FD has developed a proprietary Lending Engine to extend loans to
 these farmers.
 This follow-on investment will allow FD to scale to $13 million of loan originations in 2019 with minimal losses and exceptional returns using, RiPe, a customizable lending engine that will allow lenders to plug in and access low-cost loans origination channels such as USSD, credit scoring, identity verification and a portfolio management suite that includes recovery and collections, payments, customer support and advanced real-time data analytics.
 Elena Haba, Acting Director of Investments at EWB Canada says, “ FD has the potential to shift market attention and fill the credit gap between creditors and underserved small business owners like smallholder farmers. We believe that addressing this credit accessibility issue is a seminal first step toward building more inclusive and sustainable economies.”
 Also read: Integrity in impact investing is a two-way street
 The agriculture sector in Africa employs an estimated 70 per cent of the population and contributes over 40 per cent of GDP, but receives less than 4 per cent of total bank lending due to a lack of personal assets, credit history, and technological tools for smallholder farmers. FD has built credit histories for smallholder farmers who didn’t have financial identities before and has approved input loans to more than 53,000 farmers from as little as $5 to $500.
 FD uses mobile technology, predictive modelling, AI and a customer first approach to democratize access to loans to all farmers; ensuring farmers can apply for a loan from any type of phone and receive a decision on their loan application in seconds. FD has achieved this by building multiple channels of access and a fully automated lending process.
 For example, an SMS chatbot simulates a conversation between a borrower and a loan officer offering a private human-centred experience for the loan application process and ensuring a positive customer experience.
 Previously, FD received $50,000 USD of early-stage seed funding from EWB Canada to develop their platform and prove to financial service providers that smallholder farmers are profitable clients. In the last 4 years, FD has seen that their loans increase the productivity and incomes of farmers and has led to reduced costs, increased scale, and improved quality of agricultural portfolios for lenders.
 They also secured a partnership with Safaricom, Kenya’s largest mobile network operator, to launch DigiFarm Loans, a mobile USSD platform (*283#) that provides farmers access to affordable input loans, customized input packages, market and agricultural learning content. Today, approximately 1 million smallholder farmers in Kenya are registered on DigiFarm.
 Peris Bosire, FD’s CEO says, “Rita and I are not only passionate about this work, we understand deeply from personal experiences the value of giving loans to smallholder businesses  our school fees were paid through farm proceeds and we went on to earn First Class Honours in Computer Science.

"Top 6 Collaboration Tools for Ugandan Startups on a Lean Budget
","Remote working is one of the fast growing trends among startups in Africa  Uganda included. This stems from a couple of backgrounds. What makes a startup opt to work remotely varies from startup to startup.
 For example, some employ people from distant places or foreign countries while others can not afford money for renting an office where they can all work from at ago. For others, it is just a simple fact that some of the employees or co-founders are also doing an 8-5.
 All in all, it is very difficult for  especially  a startup to do away with remote working. The question now remains which tools to use and whether your startup can afford them or not.
 In our quest for answers to this, we decided to reach out to Ernesto Spruyt, Founder of Tunga. Tunga employs people from across Uganda, Kenya and Netherlands. All these are managed remotely.
 Here are the recommendations Ernesto made,
 1. Trello
 Ernesto says that they use trello for work planning. Trello allows you to create boards for similar or related tasks and a team member creates a card for a task on the board. Look at it as a board for sticky notes which is divided into the various columns each representing a work stage.
 For example, you can create various lists like brief, work in progress, rework, quality check and completed task. The card is moved to the next list in the sequence each time the work is finished for its present list.
 For startups on a lean budget, Trello comes very much in handy. It has three packages. The first is a free package which gives them a luxury of unlimited boards, lists, cards, members, checklists, and attachments. It also has a Business package at $9.99 per user per month (when paid annually) and  $20.83 or less per user per month (when paid annually).
 It is recommended for startups that do a lot of design works as it makes collaborating with the design team easier.
 2. Slack 
 Here, Ernesto clearly states that he recommends Slack for team communication because, unlike Trello, Slack favors lengthy conversations. It has a couple of bots that make communication lively too.
 One can only imagine what teams used to collaborate with before slack came into place. Again, it also comes in handy for startups that are operating on a lean budget as it offers a free package which includes 5GB total file storage for the team, two-person voice and video calls, searchable message archives which is upto 10k of your team’s most recent messages and so much more.
 There are other packages offered which include standard and plus. For more details about Slack pricing, you can click here.
 Trello and Slack are some of the most widely used collaboration tools
 3. Github 
 This one, Ernesto specifically recommended it for software development. Though it offers no free package, you find that its pricing is relatively affordable compared to other platforms like basecamp.
 For a team thats planning to use Github, you should budget for around $9 per month per user. The package will include organization account, unlimited public repositories, unlimited private repositories as well as team and user permissions. For pricing details, check here.
 4. E-mail
 Ernesto strongly recommends the use of e-mail for external communication. He adds that they hardly ever use e-mail for internal communication. Of course this is because, as a startup you have a whole lot of tools for communication internally. From WhatsApp, Skype, Slack etc you find it hard to use e-mails.
 Yet this isnt the case with outsiders. The other thing is that email allows you to keep track of communication through copying in your team members. It is also a universal mode of communication everywhere that exhibits professionalism. For example, you cant create a WhatsApp group to communicate with prospects yet an e-mail trail comes in handy.

 5. Google Suite
 Enersto pointed out G-Suite and  recommended it for planning as well as storage. Google Suite is a product of google that offers freemium model services that very few startups take advantage of.
 The services offered under G-suite are broken down under four categories which include communication, Storage, collaboration and management. From here, the focus is mainly on Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets, forms and Google drive.
 Google offers a variety of products that are mostly on freemium model
 Google calendar allows you to schedule meetings and appointments while as Docs, Sheets, forms and google drive allow you to contribute and store information in one place.
 6. Skype
 This comes in handy when youre making group calls. This we have added it from our experience using it to collaborate as a team. It is 100% free which means very highly recommended to startups that are running on a lean budget.
 However much we have recommended these six tools, startups need to note that new tools keep coming out everyday, new features are added to the old ones as well as pricing keeps changing. Therefore, it is recommended that youre in a constant search for more effectiveness and also constantly experimenting with new tools and methods.

"Sub-Saharan Africa to hit 634 Million unique mobile subscribers by 2025
","According to GSMA Intelligences latest Global Mobile Trends report [PDF] released this month, sub-Saharan Africa  SSA- will hit 634 million unique mobile subscribers by 2025. This will represent a 52% penetration up from last years 44%, which implied only 441 million subscribers in SSA.
 Despite the fact that Sub-Saharan Africa still has the lowest penetration rate, the region is facing a slowing penetration rate.
 The figure grew to almost 12% in the period between 2010  2015. Yet, it declined to only 5.9% from then and expected to continue on the downward spiral. Mobile subscriber growth is now firmly in single digits and will fall below 5% in the first half of the next decade, wrote GSMAi.
 
 The report singled out the younger population as a key factor to the slow growth. Around 40% of the population is 14 years and under, the report noted. Adding that any future growth will depend on developing services that cater to the group.
 Other interesting statistics about SSA pointed out in the report included smartphone adoption.

 By 2025, there will be an estimated 691 million smartphones in SSA, up from last years 244 million. The former will represent a 67% adoption rate which is double the current 33%.
 SSA still has 785 million not connected to the internet which is almost 20% of the Global total. While 403 million of these are not covered by either 3G/4G making up an estimated 42.6% of the Global figure.
 
 This explains why companies like Frobyt and Tizeti are raising funding. As well as Googles ambition to beam internet using balloons in Kenya and Uganda.
 When it comes to smartphone penetration, the role of companies like Transsion in driving down the cost of smartphones will be significant.
 The report also pointed out that the revenue for operators in the mobile space will jump to $50 billion by 2025. That is 1.9% [CAGR] up from last years $43 billion.
 They are looking to bet on digital services to increase customer engagement and drive revenue growth with mobile money central to the strategy.
 Mobile money is central to this strategy; in 39 countries across the region, the service enables financial transactions across multiple verticals while also bringing large portions of the population with limited access to a traditional financial institution into a growing digital payments ecosystem.

"U.S. tennis star Serena Williams is an investor in Andela
","On Wednesday this week, U.S. tennis star Serena Williams publicly launched her venture capital firm that she has kept from the public eye for close to 5 years. In 2014, (yes I know I can keep a secret) I launched Serena Ventures, she wrote on her Instagram. Adding that the firms mission is to give opportunities to founders across an array of industries.
 Serena Ventures invests in companies that embrace diverse leadership, individual empowerment, creativity and opportunity.
 According to Serenas husband and Reddit Founder, Alexis Ohanian, she has also been secretly investing as an angel in some remarkable startups. The list of startups that she has backed includes Coinbase  whose last fundraise valued the company at over $8 billion. Per her VC firms website, the portfolio size stands at 30 companies.
 
 Among the companies that Serena has backed include African software talent recruitment startup, Andela. However, it is not clear which particular round the tennis star participated in.
 Andelas last raise of $100 million was announced in January 2019  which is the highest so far in 2019. It brought the firms total funding raised to $181 million per Digest Africa VC Funding Leaderboard data making it the most VC funded private company in the past 10 years. Previously, Jumia was the most funded until it went public while Takealot was acquired by Naspers.

 African startups have witnessed a growing number of high profile angel investor inject cash into them. Some of these angels include Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel who has individually backed some of the African startups that join Y Combinator accelerator including Paystack.
 In March 2017, Nigerias celebrated singer and record label owner Don Jazzy became one of the first high profile celebrity to join the technology space on the continent by co-founding the free wifi services startup, Flobyt. In May 2017, he was followed by South African famous celebrity DJ, Nkosinathi Maphumulo (better known as DJ Black Coffee) who participated in South Africas on-demand cleaning services startup Sweepsouths Series A.
 Last year, South African 29-year-old celebrated TV personality Maps Maponyane also detailed his attempt to back a startup in 2014 but had to shut down at the end of 2018.
 However, despite the growing interest, there is still room for more celebrities and sports people to back African startups. Yet this is not likely to happen anytime soon because, despite the debate on lack of high net-worth individuals investing in African startups, there has not been a debate on how startups can tap into the cash and fame that international and local celebrities, as well as sports personalities, can bring.

"How to fix Uganda&#8217;s education system
","On the 15th of February, New Vision, the country’s biggest newspaper, published an article to clarify the matters around the closing down of Bridge Academies in Uganda.
 Bridge is an investor and innovator in the education sector and has gained much attention through its backing by Silicon Valley giants like the founder of Facebook, as well as its wholesale approach to cheap, private education in Africa.
 I don’t know much about the details of the Bridge case in Uganda, but the article was an illustration of the crisis the education sector in Uganda is in.
 Below I add my own views and experiences, as well as clear ideas on how the education sector could be turned around to being the fuel for business development and growth in Uganda.
 Life skills
 After having spent more than 12 years working with people all over Africa, from poor rural communities to high tech private sector companies, it becomes more and more clear to me that the key to the development of a country is the development of its people.
 As much as African countries need infrastructure and services, only a population that is empowered and instructed will use its ingenuity to use this infrastructure for something productive. So many times I have seen a lack of education is a major inhibition for a community or a person to develop, despite goodwill and efforts by NGOs and donors.
 I mean education in a broader sense than what you learn in a classroom; the NGO lingo prefers to give it labels like “life skills”. Education understood in this way includes the basic understanding of cause and effect, sense of responsibility, the consciousness of time and history, but in short: the skills needed to thrive and grow in a capitalist society.
 For Uganda is in a global village where development is measured through on capitalist indicators of growth, profit, efficiency and productivity.
 Precisely in a capitalist economy, the power of education could have such a potential, especially in a country like Uganda.
 With one of the largest “young” populations in the world, Uganda should take its investment in the next generation seriously and even use this as a way of gaining a comparative advantage over its neighbouring countries. Uganda once used to have good schools and universities, Makerere University was lauded as one of the best on the continent.
 Unfortunately, short-term thinking and the inability of government (for whatever reason) to accommodate innovation and foreign investors like Bridge will continue to result in a sluggish growth rate.
 The paradox of unemployment and the skills gap in Uganda
 Having worked for a private company in the IT and tech sector for the last four years, I have seen first-hand how the shortcomings of the education system have a crushing effect on economic and social development.
 The Norwegian IT company I work for, Laboremus, is out-sourcing software programming services to the Norwegian market. Demand for the services in Norway has been high, but the company has struggled to grow.
 One of the main reasons has been a tremendous effort it takes to train young and talented Ugandans to deliver software at an international level. On average, a very talented graduate needs two years at Laboremus before being able to work on European projects.
 Even after years of experience in Uganda, I was taken aback by the inadequate level of education that Ugandan graduates get throughout the schooling system.
 As Chairperson of the Nordic Business Association for two years, and frequently in forums with investors and entrepreneurs, my complaints are echoed by everyone: human resources issues are the biggest headaches and inhibitors of growth.
 This is a paradox in a country where unemployment is high and competition for the few formal jobs is fierce. Everyone agrees that talent is abound in Uganda, but the skills given by the education system to translate this talent into productivity, reliability, professionalism, customer care and quality is terrifyingly absent.
 Focus on theoretical learning from an early age, “cramming”, big classes with little interaction and a curriculum and pedagogic approach that punishes questioning, creativity, curiosity and play have a profound effect.
 Students are expected to sit down, be quiet, follow every wink of the teacher, learn everything by heart and then reproduce it in an exam. Yet as soon as these young people leave school or university, they face an employment market where employers value people who are problem solvers, team workers, have people skills, are innovative, entrepreneurial and so on.
 In addition to fostering these important qualities, the curricula are also tremendously outdated. If at least all the cramming resulted in a solid theoretical foundation, our task as employers would be easier.
 Especially in the fast-moving (but increasingly important) IT sector this is flagrantly evident. As one of our employees put it: One day he entered the university class and the teacher wrote XHTML on the board. He had just started to teach himself HTML5. He walked out of that classroom and never turned back.
 Without a formal bachelor’s degree, he is one of our best programmers today. Generally, Laboremus does not hunt for talent in the software engineering or computer science departments at the universities, we instead focus on the engineering streams because this is where you find people with enough capabilities in math and abstract thinking. That in itself should say something about the adequacy of the curricula.
 
 Early childhood education
 Last but not least, the education system does not provide the nurturing that young people need to grow into mature, responsible and self-confident adults.
 This is often described by employers and teachers as a “poor attitude” in the youth today, and manifests itself through a lack of loyalty, lack of commitment, inability to take advantage of an opportunity and other poor habits like stealing, fraudulent practices and “corruption”. This all goes back to the adults that these young people grow up around.
 Through my work with Fontes Foundation, we established a youth development centre where we try to primarily work on the “attitudes” of the youth to make them ready to be employed or become entrepreneurs.
 The programme includes personal development classes that work on people’s self-confidence, direction and interaction with others, a mentorship programme and a job-placement programme. In essence, we are trying to give the young people in six months what many of them did not get their entire childhood.
 At Laboremus, we work with many of the same issues with our university graduates, who have had a much more advantageous background than the disadvantaged youth in the Fontes programme.
 In a country where a large majority of children come from rural households where the older generation only had limited education, more responsibility is put on the institutions to provide the youngsters with role models and adults that can provide career guidance, personal guidance and teach children all they need to know about their health, sexuality, relationships, talents and last but not least, strong values and culture.
 Yet children are taught in classes where there is no room or time to cater for individual development problems or needs, often (still) using cruel methods of discipline and by teachers who are more concerned about their own survival or the next PLE exam than developing each child into a successful adult.
 The result of these deficiencies on both the part of the parents and the education system is that employers are left with the burden of not only teaching their employees their trade, which most are willing to do but also to provide guidance, personal development and communication skills.
 This takes time and a huge investment from the part of the employer, who is constantly faced with the risk of the employee leaving for greener pastures as soon as an opportunity with a slightly higher salary presents itself. Employers must also pay the employee a salary during the training period, during which the employee is not adding much value to the company.
 And on top of that, employers are taxed up to 43% of salaries (28% PAYE and 15% NSSF) to provide education and training that is ideally the responsibility of the government. Seen from this perspective, the poor results of the tertiary education system are in fact a socio-economic tragedy: young people spend three years of their most creative years but rarely recall more than experiments with alcohol, partying and sugar daddies from this time.
 Parents break their backs to pay for expensive university fees, often by selling cows and land or taking expensive loans. Yet after three years, after all this investment, the results are dismal.
 The action plan
 So what can be done to turn Uganda into a powerhouse of innovation, entrepreneurship and agriculture; a middle-income country as put by the country’s president?
 First and foremost, the country needs to control its explosive population growth by making family planning available to all women in the country, along with sufficient information to use it properly.
 This includes sensitisation of men and other family members, who often attempt control women’s fertility. Countries like Ethiopia have shown that it is possible to extend this even to remote rural societies. Rwanda can serve as a model in how to drastically reduce infant mortality and improve maternal health – these are also drivers of population growth.
 Once fewer children are born to the households that are already resource-strained, more focus can be put on the development of each child.
 Secondly, more emphasis needs to be put on early childhood development. It is commendable that Government wants to make early childhood learning centres available, however, this is partly barking up the wrong tree.
 Most of the skills and knowledge pre-school children need is not related to reading and writing and should not be taught in classrooms. Mothers need guidance on how to foster the cognitive development of infants from an early stage.
 Remarkable research from the US shows that the number of words spoken to a child in its early years is a great predicting factor for later academic success. Through village health workers and other community initiatives, parents should be taught about the importance of unconditional love to nurture a self-confident child, basic health knowledge and how to stimulate children’s curiosity, willingness to learn and motoric capabilities long before they set foot in a school.
 Third, the mammoth task of reforming an education system stuck in Britain in the 1950s needs to get underway. This will take years, a profound shift in attitudes and strong leadership from the top.
 One of the complaints about Bridge was that they take their teachers abroad for training. However, this is precisely what is needed: through seeking lessons and inspiration from other countries, Uganda has the unique opportunity to “leap-frog” much of the developed world and go straight into an approach that prepares the next generation for a world where robots compete with humans for jobs and subjects like IT and technology are key.
 Tech founder Jack Ma said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2018 that “If we don’t change the way we teach, in 30 years we will be in trouble [..] We need to teach something that is unique, [so] that a machine can never catch up with us”.
 Educationalists worldwide agree that because of the speed at which technology advances, more emphasis must be put on giving the youth a solid foundation of concepts, principles, values and tools so that they can become “life-long learners”, instead of learning much content.
 This includes giving the youth the skills to research, filter and analyse information, abstract thinking, problem-solving, concept development, visualisation and teamwork.
 At Laboremus, we already have workshops tackling all these subjects for our employees. This includes less focus on theoretic university education for success, but the integration of a vocational system which produces high-quality technical professionals.
 Let’s focus more on what is delivered in the schools, and how to get out from the aid-dependency trap that has also ensnared the minds. Well-enlightened teachers and students will themselves find solutions to the absence of tap water or sanitary pads in the schools.
 
 Low-hanging fruit
 While the reform of the curricula and teaching methods gets underway, there are three low hanging fruits that the Government can use to its advantage to reap short-term gains.
 First, focus on the teachers. By drastically changing the way teachers are taught and restoring teaching as a prestigious profession, an impact will be felt already when these teachers set foot in their first classroom.
 The article had many critics of the way Bridge uses tablets to guide teachers through their lessons. While this might be a little rigid and maybe not a long-term solution, it is an attempt to improve teaching at a scale that no government has until now achieved.
 E-learning has a great potential and there are plenty of start-ups and e-learning initiatives. However, our experience with Fontes shows that teachers and students are not able to take advantage of the vast resources on the Internet if they are not given basic skills in how to navigate this wealth of information, or how to successfully use e-learning as a teaching aide.
 Secondly, use the private schools as pioneers and trailblazers. Uganda’s best schools are private and private education is a huge business. Yet surprisingly, most of these schools are still stuck in the old ways of teaching.
 A need to satisfy parents, who are the ones to pay the fees, could be one of the reasons why many of them prefer to have a “traditionalist” image. At the same time, these schools are better equipped and have more resources to effect changes quickly.
 Bring a few of them on board and take lessons from the growing number of international schools who are trying out different types of curricula and teaching methods. Give these schools the freedom to innovate around curricula and methodologies, and change the metrics to assess the performance of students to incentivize schools to focus on the skills that are needed in tomorrow’s world.
 And third, don’t penalize the private sector for investing in the training of their employees. Tax breaks for training periods, cheaper work permits for foreigners and cheaper business visas for experts would all support the tremendous efforts that employers are already making.
 This would have benefits that are two-fold: first, employers would be able to hire and train more employees (about double, in fact) if taxes were slashed on training periods. Even if only one ends up in formal employment, the second one will leave with valuable skills to use elsewhere in the economy.
 At Laboremus, we receive phone calls every day from students seeking internships. The last time we hired entry-level IT graduates, we received over 900 applications. We have tried different internships and trainee programmes, some even with donor support.
 But all turned out to be too expensive for the company to make commercial sense. Yet, without building a pipeline of new talent, Laboremus is in a catch-22 situation: without more developers, we can’t make more money, but the developers take too much money to train.
 Supporting the private sector in their training efforts would also attract much-needed foreign investors to set up shop and create employment in Uganda. Although the government is currently avoiding the Elephant in the room, soon youth unemployment will catch up with Uganda.
 Problems such as crime are already on the rise and Uganda is showing much slower economic growth than neighbouring countries. With such a huge young population, it is virtually impossible for all employment creation and growth to come from within, especially with a poorly educated population. Whether we want it or not, Uganda will need investors like Bridge to bring in foreign money and skills to create the jobs needed.

"5 Tips on How to Come Up with a Name for Your African Startup
","Coming up with a startup name is the first step towards bringing your startup idea to life. A startup name conveys what your line of business is and also has the ability to show your unique characteristics. A great and unique startup name makes it easier for people to find, talk about and possibly trust you in the long run.
 Finding the right startup name for your startup can sometimes make or break it. Therefore, choosing just the perfect name is not an easy feat. It can be draining depending on how you and the team go about it. Below are items to keep in mind when picking a name for your startup
 An example is that of Phil Knight and his colleagues. Before they came up with Nike, they struggled through lots of uncatchy and not-so-straight-forward names as they looked to move away from the formerly called Blue Ribbon to the now famous Nike Inc.
 Below, we have identified some of the things to keep in the back of your mind when coming up with your startup name. By the way, if you also feel like the name you gave to your startup is not the best, it is best to rebrand as early as possible.
 1. Keep it simple
 Whichever name you opt to use, it must be easy to remember and spell. Don’t get caught up in a scenario where your prospects or current clients often confuse you with someone else. The worst case is when they mis-spell your startup name.
 As Africa, we have an advantage of the distinctive languages with words that are unique. Why not dive into them? Not only will it set you apart but also give you an advantage when looking for a website domain as well as being easily found online.
 Some of the startups that have taken on African names include JamboPay, M-Pesa, Jumia, Konga, Gebeya etc. So, go ahead
 2. Timeless and Un-limiting
 
 Let the name you pick not limit you to a narrow focus. You don’t want to limit your business to a particular product or a specific city or country. At one point in time, in case you never had it in mind, you might want to break out of those boundaries. Pick a name that will stand the test of time.
 At one point in time, in case you never had it in mind, you might want to break out of those boundaries. Pick a name that will stand the test of time.
 SO, why not pick a name that will stand the test of time no matter where you go or whatever you venture into?
 The assumption is that your startups goal is to grow into a successful business which usually takes several years.
 You don’t want to have a startup name that youre kinda embarrassed by 5-10 years down the road. The best examples here are Safaricom, MTN, Alibaba, Amazon etc.
 3. Conveys Some Meaning
 
 It is not good if you told someone your startup name and the next question is, why does it do?. On the contrary, you want to tell someone the name and they make a suggestion of what you do.
 But the aim is to pick a business name that is meaningful and relates positively to your startup. If you hear a name like JamboPay or WorldRemit, youre more likely to have a hint on what they do.
 This seems to contradict what we mentioned in number one of keeping it simple. But remember, the goal is to put all the points mentioned here at the back of your mind.
 Also, abstract names may have some appeal as they are catchy, but your branding efforts could become somewhat costly.

 4. Make Sure the Name is Available
 
 You dont want to go to the business names registry authority and they drop that bomb of were sorry but the name youre suggesting is too close to an already existing business or already taken.Availability for the name here means being able to register and or acquire “.com” domain name as well as get the legal rights to use it. (trademark)
 This point goes back to uniqueness. Making your name unique increases the chances of it being available.Availability for the name here means being able to register and or acquire “.com” domain name as well as get the legal rights to use it. (trademark)
 Secondly, visit the registration authority in your country or region. Africa has many countries which mean the procedures may differ. But, make it an effort to inquire at your local registry office.
 The same should also apply to the website domain of your preference. It makes no sense to own a business name whose domain is owned by a different person.
 5. Brainstorm and Get Feedback
 This may work or not. But, give it a try. Sit down with your team members and make suggestions of the names. Make sure you come up with a couple of different names that meet the criteria mentioned above and then run them by some people you think might be your target market.
 Make sure you come up with a couple of different names that meet the criteria mentioned above and then run them by some people you think might be your target market.
 Let them give you feedback on what they think is the message your startup name conveys. This will help with assessing catchiness and the possibility of unwanted meanings in other contexts.All things said and done, as a
 Despite all the things above, as a founder, make sure youre happy with the name. It doesnt make sense to adopt a name you dont believe in. You have to make sure you are happy with it and believe it will resonate with your customers right from the start.

"MFS Africa secures $2.5M to lower remittance fees to Africa
","MFS Africa, a Johannesburg-based fintech, has secured £2 million (~$2,576,000) in funding from the UKs Department for International Development (DFID). The investment was announced yesterday by International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt, during the launch of the Companies to Inspire Africa 2019.
 We are committed to supporting innovative African companies to make it easier for finance to flow into and across the continent. It is estimated that US$66 billion in remittances flow into Africa annually, with approximately 10% originating in the UK, she said.
 She added that:
 
 the transfer of money by foreign workers to their families in their home countries is a lifeline to many in Africa. But many are losing their hard-earned money to too high remittance fees.
 
 In 2018, MFS Africa raised a total of $14 million in funding, putting it among the 25 most funded companies across Africa in 2018, per the Digest Africa Index report. It also became the first African fintech to be funded by a China-based VC after LUN Partners Group led the Series B.
 This follow-on round, thus, falls under the Bridge category, per our methodology, and brings MFS Africas total funding raised in the past 12 months to a little over $16.5 million.
 The UK Government has before backed companies across the continent through different vehicles, the DFID included.
 A notable investment towards the end of 2018 was the CDC Groups (UKs development finance institution) $180 million investment made into Liquid Telecom. In the same year, it also participated in M-Kopas follow-on round, though the amount wasnt disclosed.
 However, the CDC Group also made investments into Jumia Group, taking part in the e-commerce giants $150 million Series C that it announced in November 2014.
 The UKs increased participation into early-stage and emerging companies on the continent  through its investment vehicles and now the London Stock Exchange  could be a move to lure them to list on the exchange when the time is right for some, like Liquid Telecom and Jumia Group.

"Uganda&#8217;s Teheca Redesigns Mama Kit to Impress Millennial Mothers
","Teheca, a Ugandan health startup, has launched Prepared Mama Kit which is an improvement of the widely used Mama Kit. The improvement is aimed at making it more appealing to new and young mothers.
 Maama is a Bantu word to mean Mother and Mama Kit is a widely used in Uganda by pregnant mothers in upcountry districts during antenatal visits and labor.
 The team at Teheca, however, decided to make it more appealing to the urban and millennial mothers by replacing the polythene bag packaging with an African material made backpack bag as well as including more products.
 After research from a number of mothers including two of whom that are our teammates we realized that the current mama kit  though comprehensive in terms of items  the quantity was insufficient, hence mothers still needed to purchase more items after delivery, Daniel Ruyonga, from Teheca, pointed out.
 Looking at this they decided, to make it bigger, easier to carry and stylish for the current Millennials.
 Contents of the Prepared Mama Kit
 It has enough quantities of maternal pharmaceuticals and also provides mothers with a bag that they can use after delivery especially during the postnatal visits and hence we evolution of the prepared mama, Daniel Ruyonga from Teheca.
 The new Prepared Mama kit, contains cotton wool, surgical gloves, surgical blade, cord clump, immunization card, soap and umbigel for the cord cleaning, gauzea and polythene sheet.
 The bag comes with a full traditional mama kit, which is currently on the market, and more items needed by mothers as well as the baby after birth.
 The bag is designed by Teheca and locally made  which is in line with the attempts to create work opportunities for youths, Daniel added.
 Most of the bag contents are branded Teheca
 Mama Kit was innovated in 1996 by Dr. Florence Oryem-Ebanyat, the second female doctor from Acholi Sub-Region. Its production started in 1997 and has become a standard kit for all mothers in Uganda.
 The kits use has extended to DRC and South Sudan, although Dr. Oryem-Ebanyat has no patent or copyright for the kit.
 The new Prepared Mama goes for UGx. 60,000 and orders can be made online through the Teheca website here.

"Uganda&#8217;s eSACCO wants to drive financial inclusion through social banking
","A 2016 study revealed that only 40% of Ugandans are financially included. The World Bank also points out that “up to 60% of adult Ugandans still keep their savings at home and in the form of assets such as animals.” This is what eSACCO wants to tackle.
 “People are financially excluded because of cost,” Wensi Nuwagaba, Co-Founder of Clic.World and Chairman of eSACCO says. Thus, according to him, bringing down the cost will foster financial inclusion.
 He gave an example of a boda-boda man who would like to save UGx. 1,000 (US $0.3) every day. But, that would cost them UGx. 500 (US $0.15). 50% of the amount being saved.
 “So what you have is financial services like microinsurance. All those kind of things which can benefit a large part of the population is too expensive to collect the premium.”
 The Ntinda-based eSACCO wants to ensure that the cost of financial inclusion goes down to almost zero.
 “If you belong to eSACCO right now, you can send money between wallets at zero,” says Wensi. Though, joining is at a fee.
 Andre van Zyl, responsible for Strategy and Business Development at Clic.World explains that social banking is at the core of the eSACCO’s strategy, which Andre believes is “the future of banking”.
 “We look at the future [and] see [it] moving from large banks down to ecosystems of smaller banks. Which in Africa we have been doing for decades,” Andre says.
 
 “There are 16,408 registered co-operatives and in 2015 alone a total of 1014 new co-operatives were registered majority of them were SACCOs and Agricultural marketing cooperative societies,” according to the Ugandan Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives.
 
 Wensi and Andre, thus, decided to build the social banking concept on top of the SACCO concept, due to its wide adoption across Uganda and East Africa.
 “So we see the SACCO model actually [in] the next ten years becoming a more accepted global way of (social) banking,” says Andre.
 Trust, being at the center of most SACCOs, Andre believes this is the same foundation they’re banking on to build the social banking concept. Amongst the previously financially excluded.
 Saying that “a couple of guys [that] know each other and trust each other are better suited to manage their money than some unknown shareholders in a large bank”.
 Andre points out that Clic.World chose to start with Uganda with the eSACCO because the country has a more flexible environment, with high digital adoption and appetite for new innovation.
 “If you are a small little fish in one big pool and then a big shark in a small one, then you go to the small pool where you’re a big shark.”
 “Uganda was a more flexible environment, to try something new. In Kenya, you got a predominant player which is MPesa.”
 Though, they still harbor plans of expanding across Africa. With Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Cameroon, Botswana, Zambia and others on their list.
 We are now at the point where we want to start expanding, Andre says. Though he maintains that they are still trying to be practical because they are a small startup”. Adding that “we need to go where we can generate business the quickest.”
 eSACCO is built on top of clic.world, which develops white-label products. So, in some of the markets, they are doing it, its through partnerships. “Clic.world doesnt go out on its own brand,” says Andre.
 Also read: This Ugandan startup is using drones in an unconventional way
 Beyond eSACCO, Andre is among those at the forefront of Cryptocurrency in Uganda. To be specific, he’s a Stellar evangelist.
 He believes that crypto can deliver on financial inclusion. Though, adding that, if cryptocurrency is to help achieve financial inclusion, then they “have got to be able to process a magnitude more transactions per second than what say a Visa is doing at the moment.” Something Stellar with its proposed implementation of Lightning is in position to do, according to Andre.
 It was on the basis of this that they came up with a “Stellar ATM”. According to Andre, this is basically how the ATM works;
 
 “So i have got cash in my pocket, feed it in, get my XLM (Stellar Lumens) on my phone and i dont want to touch cash. I go to my shop, i scan and i buy [whatever i want].”
 
 Last November, Andre and his team exhibited the ATM in Singapore. Yet despite many describing it as “innovative”, Andre says that few were willing to further the conversation after finding out it was based in Uganda. A perception, he says, they are working hard to change.
 The Stellar ATM in a Metallic Box.
 Though, he maintains that they are currently pursuing conversations with the different funders.
 “So the ATM is very interesting, we got a lot of demand for it and we [are] currently just busy discussing with funders because it is just a case we need to build. Theres a prototype [already]. The production unit is actually going to be a smaller unit and in fact, we have designed one that has got no screen.”

"What you should know about Seedstars $100M pan-African venture fund
","On April 4, 2019, Seedstars  in partnership with First Growth Ventures  announced that it was to raise a $100 million sub-Saharan fund focused on early-stage startups called Seedstars Africa Ventures. The fund will be looking to make its first investment before the close of 2019 with their ticket sizes ranging from US $250,000 to US $5,000,000.
 The African continent is witnessing extraordinary growth relative to other parts of the world. In return, many investors are looking to set up on the continent to tap into the returns and potential the Continent promises. Seedstars is one of them. The organization notes that “Africa’s growth has consistently exceeded that of developed economies in the past 15 years according to the World Bank, providing numerous investment opportunities.”
 Last year, according to the Digest Africa Index report, startups and technology companies across Africa raised a total of $686.4 million in funding across 336 disclosed funding rounds. However, much of the funding  90%  went to the top 50 most funded companies who were raising later-stage or follow-on rounds.
 According to Digest Africa data, in 2018, over 270 funding rounds both disclosed and undisclosed represent funding at the grant stage or seed funding that will require further seed or early/late venture funding. Furthermore, in 2019 Q1 so far, over 70 companies have raised funding with over 65% of these at the early seed stage.
 This implies that there’s a need for players that are willing to write immediate follow-on cheques for startups at the late Seed and early Venture stage. Seedstars thinks that it can be that partner when you look at the ticket sizes Seedstars Africa Ventures plans to write.
 “While later-stage funding is becoming increasingly available with analysts recording an increase of late-stage transactions in 2018, enterprises across the continent struggle to find long term, early-stage capital,” noted Seedstars.
 According to Tamim El Zein, a Partner at First Growth Ventures, the fund is yet to close. He pointed out that “commitments have already been made and we continue to work towards our first close at the end of this year”. Details about the fund’s Limited Partners are not yet public, but Tamim notes that they “come from a variety of industries and continents”.
 Like most funds targeting investments into African startups, both Seedstars and First Growth Ventures are European headquartered companies. Usually, such funds that are not headquartered on the continent go ahead and set up offices on the continent. An example is Paris-headquartered Partech Partners  which launched its Partech Africa Fund last year. The fund went ahead and set up an office in Senegal last year which it followed up with announcing the setting up of another one in Nairobi earlier this.
 Seedstars, given its already existing history of operation across the continent, will instead leverage that position for its fund. “What’s important to us is that the fund is operating out of Seedstars existing hubs on the Continent, which are set-up, staffed and running,” Tamim noted.
 The organization has activities in over 20 sub-Saharan Africa markets and physical hubs  called Seedspaces  in countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Tanzania.
 “With activities in over 20 sub-Saharan Africa markets and physical hubs in key countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Tanzania, the fund is being developed on strong foundations,” read the press release Digest Africa received. The only addition to the already existing hubs will be in Kenya where they are likely to open an additional location in Nairobi according to Tamim.
 When funds launch on the African continent, they usually crowd in the key markets where it is easier to find more deal flow. Tamim maintains that they are looking at building a truly pan-African fund which will seek opportunities beyond the often looked at markets.
 “There are scalable enterprises across sectors in a number of countries, including Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Tanzania, on top of the “usual three”  (Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa)”.
 The fund will also look to invest in businesses that are beyond technology. “Currently most pan African VCs focus on tech and tech-enabled businesses only”. Instead, they will be “looking at innovation at large” which will include ventures in technology and beyond.
 “Startups and scalable dynamic enterprises alike lack access to efficient capital even though they have identified the pain points of their market and have the required management capacity to scale,” noted Tamim. Some of the sectors being targeted by the fund include edtech, proptech, agtech, fintech, MedTech, cleantech, telecom, transport and Logistics as well as utilities (water, sanitation, waste).
 The Seedstars Africa Ventures fund will invest primarily through equity and quasi-equity instruments. It will also “primarily lead rounds”, though Tamim adds that they are open to co-investing whenever possible.
 If the emergence of funds in a market is a yardstick that can be used to measure how mature it is, then the African startup ecosystem is coming of age.
 Over the past 24 months, according to Digest Africa data, over 20 funds have been announced as either “First Close”, “Second Close” or “Final Close” targeting Africa at a venture or private equity stage.
 These include: Cathay Africinvest Innovation Fund ($169m), Partech Africa Fund ($143m), Proparco Africa Startup Fund ($76m), Novastar Ventures Novastar II Fund ($72.5m), KawiSafi Venture Fund ($70m), PIC Project Development Partnership Fund ($140m), Sun Funder Solar Energy Debt Fund ($42.5m), TLCom Capital Partners Tide Africa Fund ($40m), Sawari Ventures North Africa Fund I ($35m), I&amp;P Afrique Entrepreneurs 2 Fund ($28m), Kingson Capital ($28m), Goodwell Investments Goodwell IV ($23m), VilCap Investments Fund ($17.7m) and Africa Tech Ventures ($17.5m).
 Some of these funds are already starting to make investments. For example, Partech Ventures which closed its Partech Africa fund at $143 million has so far backed three companies participating in their Series A and Series B  Kudi, Yoco and Trade Depot.
 Private equity players are also slowly moving downstream and taking part in more early stage and riskier deals than before. As highlighted above, AfricInvest and Cathay closed a $169 million fund  $69 million more than anticipated. The fund will focus on African tech startups. Once closed, the Seedstars Africa fund will also be one of the larger early-stage funds on the continent.

"Togikwatako Game Shows Everything Wrong With How We Approach Innovation in Uganda
","Yesterday, seated in the Innovation Village, Julius  seated across, whispered to Solomon  seated directly opposite, about a new game on Google Play, called Togikwatako.
 The game requires the player to fight off predators trying to attack and destroy the Ugandan constitution.
 It is an imitation of the now famous (or infamous) Togikwatako national campaign by the opposition in Uganda calling upon the masses to rally against the ruling NRM party that is seeking to amend the constitution.
 When I played the game on Julius phone, it was quite interesting and i liked it because of its simplicity. So, I requested him to get me in touch with the developer  who happened to be around the Innovation Village  called Nyole Mike.
 As I waited for Mike, I decided to download and give it a try. It opens with a call to remain calm, through a song by Maddox Ssematimba  Tukume Eddembe  which continues to play in the background as you play the game.
 When Mike finally arrived and settled down, I quickly asked if he got rights from the owner to use the song. Something to which he replied no, though doesnt think it is illegal.
 This reminded me of a discussion about Intellectual Property amongst some ICTA-U members where everyone involved concluded that mass awareness about IP is needed.
 Moving on, and very keen to understand what he thinks about the viability of his idea, I asked how long it took to think and come up with the idea. He responded three days. He also let me know that this is a long-term project.
 Basically, it took three days to arrive at the decision to work on a game and launch it. Plus, this is something he thinks hell work on for the long term. No market research, nothing like studying who his ideal user is.
 This confirmed the words of Evelyn Namara in a recent interview where she said: most innovators in Uganda start with the product, then later turn around to figure out the problem it can solve.
 Any sustainable innovation should start from the problem point of view, then work backward to the solution, not the other way round.
 First of all, the decision to work on the game wasnt well thought out. It was basically excitement  in my view  because of what is taking place in the country.
 These solutions are not only half-baked but not necessary. Just a mere waste of time and the little resources they have at hand.
 It is very exciting to come up with a cool app that people can talk about for a few weeks or months, but then what next?
 Have you asked yourself whether the problem youre trying to solve even exists? If yes, should it be solved that way? What will happen when all the fuss about this entire Togikwatako campaign settles?
 Secondly, this isnt the first game Mike is working on a game. He worked on one three years ago  which he abandoned.
 When I asked him why he said I didnt have money to hire graphics people. My friends that were working on the graphics all wanted to be paid.
 The same challenge he pointed out when talking about his new Togikwatako game; theres no money to help me work on my game.
 The question remains; why move on without rectifying the challenges you faced with the first product?
 Ideally, one should seek answers to what went wrong with the first product before thinking of something new.
 But, again, how do you expect people to fund ideas that are not well thought out? Something you just wake up and start working on.
 Lastly, I wanted to find out if  in his three years of developing games  he has a firm grip on how the landscape is in Uganda.
 Thats when i asked if he knows Kola studios. He said yes. I further asked if he has ever paid them a visit  and, nope. He has never.
 Kola studios  the developers of the Matatu game  has been able to not only develop a game that got attention nationwide and beyond, but monetize it too. They have been in the industry for now over five years. So, why not keep them close?
 To me, this highlights the lack of a collaborating spirit in the ecosystem. The sense of selfishness deeply ingrained in the innovators and entrepreneurs where everyone wants to come off as Superman.
 Theres no reason for a game developer in Uganda to make mistakes in 2017 that were made by Kola Studios in 2012. Reach out to them, ask for help!
 Unless we work on the above, we shall continue to complain that our startups and entrepreneurs arent taking off for lack of a local user base, trust, and support. As long as we give users an option to choose between new disruptive (yet mediocre) solutions and old (tested and) proven solutions  theyll always opt for the latter.
 As long as we give users an option to choose between new disruptive (yet mediocre) solutions and old (tested and) proven solutions  theyll always opt for the latter.
 Therefore, I urge whoever is working closely with innovators and entrepreneurs in Uganda, to hold them to higher standards. Let them think beyond just today as well as focus on real problems.
 Lets not allow ourselves get reduced to mediocrity and later complain that Ugandans dont want to use local solutions or investors dont want to invest in our local solutions.

"Startup Grind wants to revive its defunct African chapters
","Startup Grind, a global startup community, is currently looking to revive its defunct African chapters.
 Early this week, they sent out a couple of emails to its subscribers. The emails pointed out that they were looking for different people to lead their different chapters.
 Do you miss Startup Grind Kumasi? Heres your chance to revive this community, because we are currently looking for a new Chapter Director in your city, read one of the emails.
 Some of the chapters where they are looking for chapter directors included Cairo, Isolo, Port Louis and more.
 But, they seem to have been successful in identifying the director for Cairo. This is because a day after sending out the email, they sent another email saying that they had identified two directors.

 There are 3 types of Startup Grind chapters; one for larger metro areas, one for smaller cities and one for universities. Each has its own set of requirements, Startup Grind points out.

"June Gachui joins Fezah as Country Director for Kenya
","Jazz and Soul musician, June Gachui, has joined entertainment booking startup Fezah as the country director for Kenya. Elijah Kitaka, the Co-founder, and CEO of Fezah made the announcement yesterday.
 As we start a new month, it gives us great pleasure to officially welcome June Gachui to Team Fezah, Elijah wrote.
 The multi-talented personality is a former General Manager of the Kenya Association of Music Producers (KAMP), currently running Nairobi-based JGIP CONSULTANTS which offers Intellectual Property services to a wide range of entrepreneurs in the creative industry.
 She holds a masters (LLM) in Intellectual Property Law from the George Washington University Law School, in Washington, D.C.
 According to Elijah, the Kenyan market has been a challenge to them until now. “Kenya has been very challenging for us, Elijah said. Adding that getting the right team on the ground has been much harder than we anticipated.
 The challenge could also be attributed to trying to run the Kenyan office as a satellite. Something that perhaps put them out of touch with reality and what was happening on the ground.
 Given the lack of an in-country team, we focused on giving our Kenyan artists exposure in Uganda, Elijah pointed out.
 However, they seem to have found the right candidate in June as he described her as the embodiment of creative entrepreneurship and talent.

 Fezah, a mobile app for talent booking and market intelligence, is available on both Android and iOS. The app allows artists to accept and process bookings online from talent bookers around the world.
 It also links musicians to a growing set of stages that are choosing to book through Fezah for their shows, enabling artists to apply to these stages in a single click.
 Fezah also has a market intelligence suite which notifies musicians and advertisers every time their music or ad is played on the radio in real-time. On the app, musicians and advertisers are able to get a report and competitor analysis.
 Currently, the app has at least 200 artists on its platform spread across the East African region. That is according to an interview Digest Africa had with Elijah.

"In Brief: Nigeria’s Mavin Records secures funding from Kupanda Holdings
","Mavin Records, one of Nigeria’s best-known local record labels, has secured a multi-million dollar investment from Kupanda Holdings.
 Kupanda Holdings is a joint venture between pan-Africa investment company Kupanda Capital and TPG Growth. If the name TPG rings a bell, that’s because the funding house is already a significant investor in the likes of Spotify, CAA, Uber, Airbnb and STX Entertainment.
 Mavin Records was founded in Lagos in 2012 by producer Don Jazzy – who formerly co-owned Mo’ Hits Records with Nigerian star D’Banj.
 The label is home to local artists like Tiwa Savage, Johnny Drille, Di’ja, D’Prince and Korede Bello (pictured), whose breakout hit Do Like That has been streamed over 200m times worldwide.
 Mavin’s own YouTube channel has over 680,000 subscribers, and its videos have been viewed more than 353m times on the platform to date.
 Mavin told MBW that it will use Kupanda’s investment to scale its operations under the Mavin Global brand in order to meet “rapidly growing international demand” for African music. This will include growing its roster and strengthening its services across A&amp;R, touring, marketing, distribution, publishing and partnerships.

"Africa&#8217;s Talking moves Ugandan office from Hive Colab to Acacia Place
","When Africas Talking raised US $8.6 Million earlier this year from IFC Venture Capital and Orange Digital Ventures, they highlighted expand[ing] into more African countries as their key thing.
 But, re-enforcing their positions in the existing markets seems to be one of the key reasons.
 In Uganda, the company has moved offices from Hive Colab along Kanjokya Street to Acacia Place along Acacia Avenue in Kololo.
 The new space is big enough  at least for now  with the ability to accommodate their future growth plans as Norma Atamba told me. Norma is one of the people that launched the company in Uganda  together with Nicholas Kamanzi.
 Part of Africas Talking team at their new office
 The companys team size has grown from two people at the beginning of the year to now 7. Thats 5 permanent staff and two interns. Norma thinks the number is likely to grow by 2 to 3 more people by close of the year.
 On top of a bigger space to accommodate their growth ambitions, the company is also looking to use it to hold regular fireside chats with developers. This, they believe will draw them closer to the developer community.
 Another venture that exploded in numbers and had to move was Andela.
 Also read: Edtech startup, Fundi Bots, has secured additional funding
 Earlier this year, the company moved from The Innovation Village in Ntinda to Bukoto Street in Kamwokya. They are now occupying three floors of the building.
 SafeBoda also got another office along Bukoto Street earlier this year. Making it their second.
 At the end of last week, Taxify moved their offices from Bugolobi to Ntinda. I havent found out why but the reason could be due to expansion as they have since started training Boda Boda riders. Something that requires a good amount of space.
 Most of the space still remains underutilized as they are still setting up
 All in all, it seems real estate owners are about to start smiling as more tech companies move into the country. Not only do they have the cash to burn, they also expand like a wildfire.
 I mean, which company moves from less than 10 employees to over 80 in less than a year? Unless youre a tech company.

"mcash to handle agency banking for Uganda&#8217;s leading two banks
","Ugandan banks have been looking for a way to cut costs and scale as fast and deep as possible, just like mobile money. Luckily enough, they found this in Agency banking and mcash is positioning itself as the go-between these banks and the agents.
 The service has worked well in the neighbouring markets of Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania.
 For example, in Kenya, by end of Q1 2016, there were over 40,000 bank agents. There were 17 commercial banks that had contracted 40,224 agents. These had facilitated over 170.5 million cumulative transactions valued at Ksh. 930.2 billion.
 Compared to 2015, the results were tremendous. By the same period in 2015, 16 commercial banks that had 34,381 agents that had facilitated 149.4 million transactions valued at Ksh. 817.7 billion.
 It is against this backdrop that Ugandan banks are looking at launching the service. So far, Equity, KCB, and Centenary bank have rolled out the service.
 But Shamirah Kimbugwe, Head of Agency banking at mcash, confirmed that Stanbic and DFCU are set to launch the service, too. She confirmed that the two are “finalizing their pilots”. And very soon, the two leading banks in the country will be rolling out their agency banking services.
 
 “[so far], we have successfully on-boarded DFCU and Stanbic bank, Shamirah said. We are currently finalizing their pilots.
 
 Also read: These two law firms are at the forefront of technology in Uganda
 The pilots are being carried out in the banks respective branches before rolling it out for testing outside.
 “We are in branch pilot phase and also in the final stages of integrations with Stanbic Bank Uganda,” Shamirah said.
 Stanbic and DFCU  are targeting at least three banks before the close of the year. “We want to see if we can bring on board a few other banks, but the strategy for this year is just three banks and thats it,” Shamirah said.
 Though she declined to divulge the details of the third bank, it is likely to be Barclays. Given it is already one of the banks the company has been offering its services to. The other clients in its portfolio include SafeBoda and Interswitch.
 According to Shamirah, mcash is looking at being the go-between between the agents and the banks. A positioning that will see it lay the foundation for agency banking in the country.
 “mcash as a company is positioning itself as an agent network manager,” said Shamirah. “What that means is that we are the go between the key stakeholders in agency banking including banks and the agent network itself as well as the customers.”
 In this capacity, theyll serve an outsourced function to any bank seeking to roll out the service. This will involve providing “the technical arm in both recruitment and managing agents as well as supporting the whole agent network system.”
 Other services include technical support by servicing their hardware and back-end operations. “We help them in reconciliations, in commission handling, in float top-ups and float handling and so on and so forth,” says Shamirah.
 Going by the current traction, one can anecdotally conclude that Equity Bank is leading the agency banking race in the country.
 The bank is building its service in-house. Bench-marking on its expertise from Kenya and Rwanda. Centenary bank, too, is building the service in-house.
 We have a fair understanding of what they are doing and there is a likelihood that they are developing in-house,” Shamirah said.
 Though, she would so love that they outsource the function to an ANM [Agency Network Manager].” According to her, “there is better creativity and innovation around that channel” by using an ANM.
 She argues that ANMs are able to cut costs as well as build the expertise because they work with various banks.
 “We have lower costs when it comes to rolling out and also management as opposed to the bank, Shamirah said.
 Founded in 2011, mcash, a Ugandan fintech company offers Virtual wallets, Digital Payments, Mobile Banking, and Agency Banking Aggregation. One of the companys solutions, MOBISMS, allows merchants to take payments directly from customer’s mobile phone

"Perfecting your investor pitch
","In today’s world, everyone believes they have a startup worth funding. This isn’t always true (obviously) and investors are left with the daunting task of having to sift through the myriad pitches and select what they believe could be the next big thing.
 If you’re looking to pitch, the above creates a number of issues; the biggest one being the very limited amount of time available for pitching, typically, 3 minutes (5 if you’re lucky).
 Over the years, many writers have converged on the 10 slides you need for a pitch, but today, I present a rather radical approach; not to disregard the 10-slide rule, of course! This approach doesn’t seek to replace the 10-slide rule, but rather to enhance it.
 Here’s how to pitch:
 The ability to connect with your audience is key for a successful and memorable pitch. I have highlighted a few ways to do this:
 
 Confidence is key
 Keep in mind that confidence dictates the tone of your voice and how engaging you come off. If you come off as timid, many investors will translate this into diminished capacity to run an enterprise. Practicing your pitch with friends and family numerous times before the pitch will go a long way towards making you feel more confident about the gospel you’re preaching.
 Humanise your pitch
 When trying to use the 10-slide approach, many people tend to create incoherent pitches without “natural” transitions between slides. It is important to always remind yourself that the people before you are exactly that, people. They have emotions and are susceptible to a good story; focus your energy on taking them on a journey from the inception of your idea through to your vision for what the future holds.
 The problem? Target market? Value Proposition? Scaling?
 Be sure to articulate the problem and make the audience understand the pain point for the target market, even if they themselves are not potential users. Be sure to help them visualise who your target is and just how many people would want/need your product.
 Precisely state what value your product has to offer the customers, explain this as vividly as you can — even if your value proposition is a feeling e.g. a new line of luxury watches could have its value proposition as a feeling of exclusivity. Make sure the audience understands what you’re selling.
 When your audience understands the problem you’re solving, and for whom, explain to them how you envision your startup scaling. It’s important that you use financial projections to help the audience visualise your potential scaling capabilities.
 Do your due diligence
 Before you walk into a room full of potential investors, be sure that you have done all the research that has any significance to your pitch. Most importantly, find out as much about the competition as you can. You will have to answer questions about the competition so pretending the competition doesn’t exist is an unwise move. Investors are looking for bold people who like to identify their challenges and face them head-on.
 Build the right team
 Investors invest in the team and not really the idea because they need to know that the team you’ve built around the idea has the capacity to execute the idea in a profitable way. I have written an article about building a winning team, perhaps you could get a few pointers.
 Create a stunning presentation
 During your pitch, the investors listen to you and watch your presentation simultaneously, which makes both aspects equally important.
 Spend some time to use presentation software to create neat graphics and slides. There are multiple packages you can use to create your presentation e.g. Microsoft Powerpoint, Keynote for Mac users and Prezi which is an online tool with amazing transitions. My personal favourite is Canva which is a web app with multiple templates and gives you the ability to create and download beautiful graphics.
 
 Ultimately, always remember that a pitch is a human interaction and focusing on the social aspects of a pitch will help to make you more memorable.
 However, the social aspects should be the icing on the cake, after you’ve added all the core facts, research, statistics and financial estimates to your pitch.
 Good luck with your next pitch!

"Why you Should Work with a Co-founder on your Startup
","One of the most important and crucial decisions while starting a business is whether to partner with someone, create a team or fly solo. It’s no shocker that the most successful tech companies in the past decades have more than one founder or co-founders, looking at Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel, Yahoo and YouTube to mention a few.
 And yes, there are also successful tech companies with single founders like Amazon and eBay. Try comparing the numbers and you’ll see which group has more. Below are 4 reasons why you should undoubtedly have a co-founder!
 Brain storming and Decision making
 Its common for the human brain to hit a block in the thinking process and see no solution, well; until you share with someone, an extra set of fresh eyes, a partner that is when you can find a solution.
 Brainstorming sessions help you grow, bond better with your co-founder and come up with creative solutions and better decision making. You will push each other to the limits by questioning the loopholes in your ideas. These discussions form the pillars of any startup.
 Pool of skills
 Not everyone is born with extraordinary skills, and not everyone is good at everything either. Startups and Businesses have several facets and one can’t master all of them. You could divide departments according to your skill set as well as that of your co-founder’s and ensure that work gets done faster.

 5 Things Ugandan Startups Should Consider When Choosing a Co-working Space
 Investors
 Soon you’ll find that few investor are willing to go into businesses with single founders especially startups since it doesn’t mitigate the risks in anyway whatsoever, yet risk mitigation is a key factor for investors.
 You may face with some unfortunate accident or you may lose motivation or even early midlife crisis. In such a case, the company is shattered in a blink of an eye if you are solo and both the company and investment are likely gone.
 Stress distribution
 Business has never been and will most likely never be a smooth straight highway. There are continuous potholes, speed bumps and steep uphill and slopes like a country road.
 So, as a solo entrepreneur you’re never going to feel more alone, therefore put yourself in a situation to share the stress with someone that you’re working with every day. And also share the happiness, have fun with, celebrate the success and part hard together
 Given the global statistics, there are very few companies that make it big solo. It may be difficult to find the right co-founder, but if you do, there’s nothing like it.

"Uber rolls out IRT call-back line to all Sub-Saharan cities
","Ride-hailing app Uber has rolled out an Incident Response Team (IRT) call-back line in a bid to improve safety and security. We’re excited to announce the launch of a new Incident Response Team call-back line for safety-related matters, Uber Uganda wrote in its blog.
 According to the communication, the feature has been added to all sub-Saharan cities where Uber operates. This will provide riders across the entire region with full-time access to Uber’s IRT team.
 It provides riders with the ability to submit a ticket for a critical safety incident or accident through the app, including their contact number and a short description of the event. They then receive a call-back within a couple minutes from the Team. 
 Uber recommends riders to always first use the national emergency line (039 321 7499 for Uganda) in the event of a critical safety-related issue. 
 The launch of the new IRT call-back line is a firm confirmation of the company’s commitment to security. A rider can have access to a global network of customer support centers to provide 24/7 support for general queries all over the world which can be accessed through the app.
 
 “Everyone has the right to be safe, whether they’re on a train, in a taxi, walking on a sidewalk or in an Uber. And while no means of transportation can be 100% incident or accident-free, we believe that technological improvements can aid in improving safety while on the road.
 
 The introduction of this feature follows a driver safety policy that the ride-hailing firm put up to automatically log off drivers who have been working or logged on for 12 straight hours. This, it believes will ensure that the drivers take a rest while enhancing safety.
 Uber is striving to create a safe and pleasant environment for both riders and driver-partners, in an industry that commands a growing competition across the continent. Such guidelines are of importance especially when the public is gaining trust in ride-hailing technology. 
 The company currently operates in 15 African cities across 9 countries. With South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya taking the bigger market share. The least the company would wish for is to be banned from any of these markets as it has faced in some parts of the world.

"Uganda’s Quick Taxi to Introduce Mobile Money Payment Option
","On January 24, 2017, Quick Taxi launched in Uganda- making it the third taxi hailing service provider after Uber and Friendship taxi. On that very day, they made their app available for download. So far, the app downloads are just slightly above 1500 – according to Carl Peter, Head of Tech at Quick taxi.
 A month later, Quick Taxi is adding more services to ensure its more user friendly as well as gain an upper hand over the competition. This week, they’re are set to introduce mobile money payment option adding to the already existing cash and visa payment options. Users will be able to make their payments using either Airtel Money or MTN Mobile Money. This comes after a month of running a series of Beta tests.
 
 They believe this will be a big boost in business as majority of Ugandans have since appreciated it as a convenient way of carrying out transactions. However, according to Carl Peter, they’re looking at pushing for mobile money payment option more.
 Quick Taxi is a brainchild of Ugandan tech developers with backing from Chinese investors – whom the quick taxi team declined to disclose. However, we understand that the investors brought on board a fleet of 200 branded cars, technical expertise and funding. The full details of the entire deal remain undisclosed for now  but we hope to get more information and once we do, you’ll be the first to know.
 With 200 branded cars and an additional 390 private cars, Quick Taxi is covering Kampala, Mukono, Entebbe, Kyengera, Wakiso and some of their surrounding areas. But, if we’re to go by the words of Carl Peter, they’re set to expand and cover all the major cities in Uganda like Jinja, Mbarara, Gulu, Arua etc by close of 2017. He also hinted on their intention to expand to both the Kenyan and Tanzanian markets immediately they fully cover the Ugandan one.
 However, we do not know how the regional expansion will work out given that Rocket Internet’s Easy Taxi exited the Kenyan market last year and the current head-on competition between Uber and Safaricom’s Little Cab.
 According to Carl Peter, a quick taxi driver makes an average of UGx. 400,000 per week. He however said that the drivers in branded cars make slightly more than those in private cars – a figure he declined to reveal.
 Currently, Quick Taxi takes 20% of the revenue earned by the private drivers. Though, before the 3rd month on the platform, the driver takes 100% of the revenues. For the drivers in their branded cars, they’re required to pay a one-time security deposit of UGx. 500, 0000 and later a daily fee of UGx. 90,000 to Quick Taxi for a period of 5 years – after which they can own the car.
 Quick Taxi is still doing active recruitment and for one to join, they’re required to have a driving permit, a car in good mechanical conditions and it’s log book.

 Henry wrote; We have brought on board Standard Bank, sub-Saharan Africa’s largest bank, as our cornerstone investor.
 They will also be looking for more pan-African corporates. The goal will be to address the huge logistical and infrastructure issues which make Africa a tricky place to scale in.
 Roo Rogers, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Founders Factory Africa, told TechCrunch; You need existing incumbents here to partner with. But this is not going to be a top-down approach, we will build locally with local teams and local partners in every case.”
 Started by Brent Hoberman and Henry Lane Fox, Founders Factory has received investment from several corporate partners. These include; Marks &amp; Spencer, L’Oreal, easyJet, Guardian Media Group, Aviva, Holtzbrinck and CSC.
 Founders Factory runs both an incubator and accelerator. The incubator is aimed at helping founders start businesses. Founders Factory receives a minority stake in each startup. That is in exchange for IP, £150,000 seed round and 12 months of operational support.
 Our incubator is a fast-track for talented people to become Founders, writes Founders Factory. We validate new ideas, leverage data, distribution and IP from our partners, then build founding teams to develop 13 startups each year.
 Founders Factory takes 4-8% equity in startups that take part in their accelerator. In exchange, they offer the startup £30,000 of cash, VC and Angel network, 6 months of support and more.

"Victor Asemota to lead VC firm Alta Global Ventures&#8217;s business in Africa
","Alta Global Ventures is the latest global VC firm to make an entry into the African continent. But, they are doing this through a well-known and established partner  Victor Asemota.
 In August 2018, Victor updated his LinkedIn profile to reflect his new position at Alta Global Ventures as the Africa Partner. He followed this with a quick bio of what the VC firm does and  perhaps  what his focus will be.
 Alta Global Ventures supports passionate entrepreneurs from the top ecosystems around the world, read the first line.
 Alta Global invests directly into venture stage and growth stage companies targeting high-growth markets and connects them to key resources throughout our global network, another read.
 When I contacted Victor at the beginning of September for more details about his position at Alta Global, he pointed out that the firm would reach out to the public and media through a press release. There is an embargo on media coverage of the fund until it is officially announced, he wrote.
 It was earlier anticipated that the official announcement would be made before the close of this year. Yet, Victor informed me this week that it was pushed to the first quarter next year.
 Also read: Silicon Valley: Invest in Africa, But Do It Differently
 
 Alta Global Ventures has updated the Offices &amp; Global Partners to include Africa. But, they havent yet added Victor among their partners on the website.
 The fund has offices across five continents with its headquarters in Utah, US. Going by the slogan talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not, Alta Global Ventures was founded in 2010.  Among its portfolio includes Ancestry, a resource for online family history &amp; genealogy, Arrivedo, Wandero and more.
 There are no other details about Altas activities across the African continent. This is because most of our questions are still unanswered. But, this article will be updated once we get more details.

 Currently a board advisor for Flutterwave, Victor is among the notable mentors and key figures in Africas tech startup ecosystem. Thus, it is no doubt that Alta Global Ventures would have picked no better partner to go with.
 Victor also co-founded technology company, SwiftaCorp, over 15 years ago. The company has operations across the continent. He has also served as a mentor with the Google Launchpad Accelerator since July 2016.
 A graduate of the University of Benin, Sheffield Hallam and Harvard Business School, Victor is also a notable author on tech, startups, and innovation across Africa. His articles have been published by CNN, The Guardian Nigeria and more.
 Earlier this month, Founders Factory, a UK-based corporate-backed accelerator, also announced its entry into Africa. This will significantly reduce the need for one to travel for long distances to access world-class support.

"This is why Facebook Groups are the reason OLX is exiting Kenya, Nigeria
","Earlier this week, OLX announced it was shutting down its offices in Kenya and Nigeria. Going forward, the team in South Africa will handle operations for the rest of Africa.
 Yet, its not only OLX facing hard times. In January 2018, Jumia market Rwanda folded into Jumia Deals. Becoming a classifieds e-commerce platform. In December 2017, Konga shifted to what many believed to be a classifieds model. Before getting acquired by Yudalas parent company  Zinox  for $10 Million in January 2018. In November last year, Jumia Groups Jumia House, Jumia Deals and Jumia Jobs laid off all staff in Uganda.
 In all these cases, theres one thing consistent. A classifieds e-commerce model. It seems to not be working in the African market.
 This year, Geopoll polled 2,031 respondents in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. The report pointed out that Informal transactions through Facebook groups are threatening the success of e-commerce giants. It also added that Jumia still remains the most preferred e-commerce vendor.
 Shopping in Africa is not a transaction, especially for the lower-middle income group. It is more of a social activity. Before a person gets something off the shelf, they engage in a conversation with the vendor. This conversation enables the establishment of trust between parties. Some end up buying depending on the tribe or something they share in common with the seller.
 Thus, carrying out a transaction in Africa needs more trust than most places. Yet, the majority  if not all  of the products on these classifieds platforms, are second hand. Which calls for even more trust if one is buying something from such platforms.
 Being a diverse continent, people are looking to buy from those they can relate to. Again, for trust issues. Because remember, theres no return policy when it comes to platforms like OLX.
 Statistics of one of the leading E-Commerce Facebook Groups in Uganda called Liquidation Uganda
 In Africa, you can tell someones country, district or region by mere looking at the name. For example, in Uganda, I can tell a difference between a Munyankore and Muganda by the surnames. I can as well tell the difference between a Nigerian, Kenyan, Ethiopian, Egyptian and more. This allows one to establish who is closes to them that they can trust, hence buy from.
 This is the experience Facebook Groups bring to the table. With them, youre able to do a background check on someone and find out what you have in common before buying. Yet, I would have to either email or call someone on OLX to find out what we have in common. Thats so much a cost for establishing trust.
 You may argue that Jumia (Mall &amp; Market Place) doesnt offer the same service as Facebook groups. Yes. But lets not forget that all products on Jumia are new products. There is also a return policy. Which, by default, establishes some level of trust between the parties.
 In this post, Prof. Ndubuisi Ekekwe predicts Facebook Groups To Become Africa’s #1 Ecommerce Platform. He points out the reasons for that being the free internet, trust and the Network effect. The lack of all these combined makes it hard for an e-commerce platform to thrive on the African internet.
 Anyone thinking of a classifieds model in Africa should incorporate social and trust. Plus, if they can, should secure partnerships with the leading telecoms. This can ensure users access the platform without incurring internet data charges. Which is impossible. Given classifieds platforms are not the most profitable to attract such investment in them.

"Here&#8217;s What Up Accelerate Startups Learned and the Challenges they Faced
","Next week, on the 5th of October, Up Accelerate will be holding a Demo day for its Cycle II winners. The event will take place at Imperial Royale Hotel. The Demo day has become the tradition that concludes four months of intensive Boot camps the finalists of the program are subjected to.
 The Demo day will see presentations from Ecosmartpads, Health data harvesters, mScan, and iDrain. Actually, iDrain was part of the finalists in the first cycle  the team was unable to present at the demo day for reasons we werent able to find out.
 So, it will replace Blood Finder on the list  a team we are also yet to find out why they are not able to do a presentation this Demo day.
 In a bid to establish what these startups have learned so far, we carried out a follow-up and heres what they had to say.
 
 
 Ecosmartpads
 
 
 They aim to tackle the problem of women and girls from low-income backgrounds unable to afford sanitary pads. These, the team says, resort to using unhealthy and rudimentary ways during menstruation.
 Their solution is to recycle sugarcane bagasse from which theyll make biodegradable pads and the ultimate goal is to sell them at half the price of the existing pads on the market.
 Photo Credit: Innov8tiv
 In a call with Asiimwe Lydia, the team leader,  she informed us that theres a lot of connections and networks they have built from the program.
 
 Outbox has a lot of people to help you move your project forward. We were able to access a vast network of expats and mentors as well as people who have been there before us in the field of innovation and startups. They have really helped to push us forward.  Lydia
 
 2. Health Data Harvester
 The Health Data Harvesters Team at this years Young Achievers Awards
 The teams solution is a web-based platform or mobile app to address the problem of manual patient data collection.
 The end goal is to digitize the process for the medical professionals conducting medical camps and outreaches outside the hospital structures.
 Also read: 10 Teams Shortlisted for the Up Accelerate Pitch Day
 They hope that the data collected using the app should be more accurate, secure and easily transferable onto a hospital database.
 Jacqueline Mutumba, who is the team leader, informed us that their experience in the up accelerate program has been quite eye-opening.
 
 We learned how to focus on our end user during the development process by using the principle of human-centered design. We gained business support and valuable partnerships through this program,  Jacqueline.
 
 The entire program was tailored to help us launch our startup in a challenging economic environment. Another positive outcome was the mentorship and coaching offered by Richard Zulu and his team. The check-ins kept us on track, she added.
 3. M-Scan
 The teams solution is an ultrasonic probe and software aimed at supporting ultrasound scanning in low-resource areas so as to address the problem of inadequate ultrasound services.
 Innocent Menyo, the team leader, admitted that the program has been great in different areas.
 
 We really learned much about prototyping and financials. Id rate it 9/10, he said before adding that they joined the program without mentors with expertise in prototyping and specifically the areas we were doing. But we have been able to secure mentors.
 4. iDrain
 This is an improved chest drainage system that removes the pleural accumulation of patients (new mothers). iDrain seeks to solve the growing problem of using mineral water bottles in hospitals to drain pleural effusions.
 Amos Mutebi, the team leader, agreed with all other colleagues that the program, in general, was really helpful though citing no specific area.
 iDrain Team
 When we asked them about the challenges they faced and how the program can be made better, Lydia said that the time awarded to the teams to execute activities is limited.
 We were a team that had started from proof of concept and a prototype which was tricky at the time yet were expected to go through all the stages until the product is ready for market, she added.
 Another person that shared the same challenge with Lydia is Jacqueline. She says the only challenge was limited time to absorb all the valuable knowledge they had to offer.
 The two went ahead to suggest that the program should consider increasing the time to at least 6 months.
 Amoss challenge was the fact that they had to travel from Mbarara to Kampala on a regular basis yet both him and his team member were students. Otherwise, he did not find any challenges with the program.

"Swipe2Pay Wants to Help Small Businesses Access Loans Against their Sales
","Access to credit remains one of the biggest hurdles small businesses and startups face in Uganda. One factor contributing to this is how informal their operations are, which makes it hard for the credit institutions to assess their level of creditworthiness.
 It, therefore, becomes impossible to leverage their sales to access loans and other benefits. In most cases, they are required to present collateral assets to get loans. Yet, given most of the small business owners are young men and women, they lack such assets.
 What if there was a way to empower them, to leverage their sales instead?
 Swipe2Pay is a payment solutions startup looking to empower small businesses to take on payments from both mobile money and cards so that they can be easily credit scored. This, in the end, will help them to easily access loans from banks  against their sales.
 Solomon Kitumba, the co-founder, believes theres something that can be done to help these small businesses. Because they make sales every day, he pointed out.
 
 You find your Rolex guy, he makes sales every day. But most of them are still doing pen and paper record keeping. So, at the end of the day, they write things down, he addd.
 
 However, this data does not make sense to banks and other credit organizations. Hence the difficulty small business owners face accessing credit against their sales.
 The second thing that Swipe2Pay would like to help small businesses with is tapping into card and mobile money payments.
 Many of these businesses are missing out on these electronic payments. Yes we do have the money on our mobile money accounts, but just the process of paying to the customer is too long, Solomon Kitumba.
 Currently, one can pay for goods and services using mobile money. However, the process is ridiculously long. By the time one is done with the entire payments process of a single transaction, they are tired. So, just imagine if youre to do more than one transactions a day? Solomon calls swipe2pay a one-step checkout.
 Solomon calls swipe2pay a one-step checkout.
 
 The merchant enters my number and I also enter my pin. Online businesses have been doing this for a long time, yet the offline people dont know about it. They have no clue. So, we are trying to create an opportunity for them, Solomon added.
 
 The ideal businesses Swipe2Pay is targeting are those that employ from 1-5 people and have a smartphone. They should also be able to understand how to use that smartphone and mobile money.
 Making Money
 To make money, Swipe2Pay plans on charging 1.5% on every transaction thats made via mobile money. For card payments, thats still up for discussion  they havent yet decided on the rates.
 Swipe2Pay also aggregates payments for other startups, though not their core business.
 Since it is not our core business we are planning on doing it at 1%. People are building solutions but aggregation is not easy. Yet those offering the service are charging high rates as high as 3% or 2%, Solomon pointed out.
 Additionally, Swipe2Pay has smart card readers they sell to merchants in order for them to be able to accept card payments. Each card is manufactured at roughly $9 and sold at $13.
 Lack of trust in Local Solutions
 Most local solutions, especially in fintech, receive a very poor reception. This is partly because people have trust issues when it comes to money. And, when you combine it with the fact that Ugandans think only foreign solutions are genuine, the situation only gets worse.
 But Solomon is hopeful that the way theyre packaging Swipe2pay could be the solution to that challenge.
 I didnt like mobile money 5 years ago but have reached a point where I love it, Solomon highlighted.
 If youre promising me access to someones mobile wallet, then I can pay for that solution. Many people walk around with over a million in their pockets but cannot pay. How about if I can help them pay? So, if you package that well for me as a merchant, I can take on that solution,  Solomon Kitumba added.
 Secondly, he also thinks that the promise of enabling merchants to access loans from banks without having land titles or giving away their cars is a plus.
 
 Thats good enough for me as a merchant. I am like ok, I can make sales overtime and a bank can complement my profit,  Solomon Kitumba
 
 However, Swipe2Pay has not yet gone hard on the market though they are trying it out with a few people that, as Solomon said,  are really interested and helping us iterate and make changes.

"Egypt&#8217;s Halan actually raised $4.3M in their recently announced Series A
","Halan, an Egyptian ride-hailing startup, announced its Series A at the beginning of the month. The funding came from the existing backer, Battery Road Digital Holdings. As well as one of Egypt’s leading VCs, AlgebraVentures. But, startup declined to disclose the actual amount referring to it as multi-million.
 Yet, filings by Halan to the Securities and Exchange Commission reveal the amount.
 Mounir Nakhla, Halans co-founder and CEO, made the filing in September this year. The startup was looking to raise $4,384,559 but managed $4,364,559  leaving a $20,000 deficit.
 Though, this wasnt their first to file with the SEC. In November 2017, the ride-hailing startup filed after raising $525,000 of the $550,000 they wanted. The form was also filed by Mounir Nakhla. Battery Road Digital Holdings participated in this particular round.
 To-date, Halan has raised two Series  Series Seed and Series A  bringing their total funding to at least $4.9 million.
 Launched in 2017, they offer ride-hailing and on-demand logistics solutions. The startup focuses on what they call the under-served population. That is people not catered for by the existing tech-driven transportation services.
 According to MENAbytes, Mounir Nakhla and Ahmed Mohsen co-founded Halan. Though Careem’s former regional director Mohamed Aboulnaga joined them ten months later. He came on board both as a co-founder and Chief Commercial Officer.
 Their executive team also includes Dina Ghabbour. He was with Ghabbour Auto, one of Egypt’s largest automotive companies. He now serves as Halans Chief Marketing Officer.
 The startups fleet consists of two-wheelers (motorcycles) and three-wheelers, known as Tuk Tuk. Their services are currently available across Egypt only. These include ride-hailing through motorcycles and Tuk Tuks.
 
 Halan also offers on-demand delivery solutions including business to business and business to customer deliveries through motorcycles and tricycles.
 
 Egypt is becoming a key market for major and upcoming ride-hailing companies. In less than a month ago, both Uber and Careem launched their bus services. These are coming to a market where Swvl  that has raised over $8 million this year, part of which came from Careem  is the incumbent. The other notable bus-hailing startup in Egypt is Buseet which is a premium bus sharing platform.

"Nigeria&#8217;s Tizeti raises $3M to expand its wifi to other African countries
","Tizeti, a Nigerian internet provider, has raised $3 million to expand its services. Thats according to TechCrunch.
 The startup which operates the wifi.ng brand is looking to use the funds to expand to Ghana after launching a wifi.africa brand. Other African countries are likely to follow afterward.
 4DX Ventures led the round. It has also invested in other notable African startups. Flutterwave, Andela, Sokowatch, and mPharma being some of them.
 Headquartered in Lagos, Tizeti participated in Y Combinators Winter 2017 batch. It has thus joined the growing list of YC graduates that have successfully raised follow-on funding.
 Also read: Take a look at these 14 Y Combinator graduates from Africa
 Notably, Tizeti raised $2.1 million in seed funding in June last year. Investors included Western Technology Investment, Social Capital, Vy Capital, Picus Capital, Ace &amp; Company, Lynett Capital Partners, Zeno Ventures. YC’s Michael Seibel and Gabriel Hammond also participated in the round as angels.
 This recent round, which is likely to be their Series A, thus, brings their total funding raised to date to at least $5.1 million.
 Last year, Tizeti announced a partnership with Facebook at AfricaCom.
 This would result in the expansion of express wifi in Nigeria. With plans to roll out hundreds of hotspots over the coming months across Africa.
 Founded in 2012, by Ifeanyi Okonkwo (COO) and former ExxonMobil engineer Kendall Ananyi (CEO), the startup uses solar powered wifi towers to provide high-speed broadband internet to residences, businesses, events, conferences and also deploy public Wi-fi Hotspot at different locations.
 Internet access and connectivity is still a big problem across the African continent. So, a couple of startups and multinationals are coming onboard to tackle it.
 Nigerias Flobyt, which counts Don Jazzy as a co-founder, says that it is working on offering free wifi. Google is piloting the use of balloons in hard to reach areas, starting with Kenya and Uganda, in Africa.
 While Facebook brought to a halt its plans to use drones to beam internet. Though that doesnt mean they have given up on their plan.

But that hasn’t been the case, yet.
 Put in place in January, Abel informed me that no one has ever paid for their products using Bitcoin or cryptocurrency to-date. “There’s nobody yet, to be honest,” Abel said.

"16 of Africa&#8217;s most high profile startup failures of the past 10 years
","No one starts something expecting to fail. Yet, when it comes to startups, that is what everyone should anticipate. Studies have shown that at least 90% of all startups fail [PDF] that is why ‘fail fast, fail often’ or fail fast, fail cheap is a highly significant area of the agile philosophy. History suggests that one should not be surprised when a startup announces that it is closing its doors, yet we are always surprised.
 Based on Digest Africa research, we have looked up what we consider the most significant startup failures across Africa. In doing this research we point out some of the startups that had become high profile  by raising significant funding, assembling a stellar founding team, were described by the media as the next big thing or had attained some level of market traction  but found themselves on a downward spiral a few years down the road.
 On average, it took each of these startups 4 years from its founding date to fail. Mxit  which was founded in 2004 and died in 2015, took the longest time while Egypt’s ridesharing startup Ousta, which was founded in 2016 and died in 2017, was the youngest. Some of the key reasons that the startups cited for failure included the inability to raise follow-on funding as well as stiff competition from better-financed rivals.
 We hope the failures help others learn, grow and succeed!
 1. Wabona (2012  2015)
 Wabona was one of the many startups that were looking to make video-on-demand a big industry across Africa. The startup was founded by two South Africans  Simbarashe Mabasha and Simukayi Mukuna  in 2012. However, in August 2015, the startup shutdown after it failed to raise follow-on funding as well as the “uncertainty in the African video-on-demand (VoD) space”. Wabona failed to find a sustainable business model according to one of its co-founders: “African VoD services are still struggling to find the best business model, and there is a platform bubble. In this kind of operating environment, it became tough for us to get long term funding,” Mabasha noted. At the time of its closure, it had raised funding from the now-defunct 88mph.ac as well as CRE Venture Capital  one of Africa’s most prominent VC firms which led Andela’s US $40 million Series C.
 2. Mxit (2004  2015)
 In 2013, chat app Mxit a South African social networking platform reported that its monthly active user base was 7.5 million – but this figure dropped to just 1.2 million monthly active users in July 2015. In October 2015, Mxit announced that it was finally shutting down its corporate operations but would still leave the app available for download and use. Yet, a year later in October 2016, the app users couldnt send and receive messages anymore. The startup was founded in 2004. Mxit rode the instant messaging wave before the likes of BlackBerry Messenger and WhatsApp took off with the advent of smartphones and was a popular app of choice among South African teens and twenty-somethings when it entered the pre-smartphone era in 2005. In 2012, it acquired Motribe  a platform that allowed anyone, anywhere to build, manage and generate revenue from their own social mobile website. However, it fell victim to the rise of intense competition from international offerings such as WhatsApp and Facebook.
 3. Ousta (2016  2017)
 Egyptian ride-hailing startup Ousta shut down last year after it faced tremendous competition from global ride-hailing pioneer Uber and regional super-power Careem. In December 2016, both Carem and Ousta filed complaints [Arabic] with the Egyptian Competition Authority against competitor Uber for “flooding the local market”. The startups filed a complaint after Uber decided to not raise fares and forgo the 20% service fee it charges drivers until the end of January 2017. At the time of shut down, the startup  founded in 2016  had raised at least $1.6 million in total funding from angel investors Omar Salah and Nader El -Batrawi.
 4. Afrostream (2014  2017)
 In September 2017, Tonjé BAKANG  the founder and CEO of Afrostream, a subscription video-on-demand startup that carried Afro-American and African movies, announced [French] that they were shutting down the venture. At the time of making the decision, Afrosteam had taken part in the prestigious Y Combinator accelerator program and had gone ahead to raise an undisclosed amount of funding from Orange Digital Ventures and four other investors. According to Tonje, Afrostream failed because they couldn’t afford to raise further funding to finance the content acquisition. His efforts to find a potential buyer for the startup also failed, which led to their final demise. “Between April and August 2017, I start[ed] discussions with more than 10 potential buyers, I move[d] to Los Angeles, Miami and New York to convince them to move quickly because I know [sic] that our cash would not allow us to pass the summer,” wrote Tonje.
 5. DealDey (2011  2018)
 Founded by Konga founder Sim Shagaya in 2011, DealDey was a Nigerian daily deals platform that officially shut down its operations towards the end of 2018. By 2015, DealDey was among Nigeria’s biggest eCommerce platforms, attracting a $5 million investment from Kinnevik. Things, however, took a turn for the worse shortly after, leading the company to lay off 60% of its workforce towards the end of 2015. In April 2016, it was reported that the company was acquired by Ringier Africa for US $5 million. It is reported that DealDey’s eventual death came from the stiff competition that Jumia and Konga  who were more capitalised  exerted onto it.
 6. OyaPay (2017  2019)
 This is a case of a startup that failed before it even got to see the real light of the day. OyaPay was a Nigerian fintech that was billed to be among the most promising yet found itself struggling and finally shutting down in February 2019. Founded by a team of three co-founders led by Abdulhamid Hassan as the CEO, OyaPay’s sudden death is attributed to a family investment gone wrong. According to Hassan, he had earlier taken a “small seed round from a senior family member (an uncle)”, and at the point of product market fit where the need for investors kicked in, the said family member pushed back on the idea of diluting his investment. “For months we couldn’t resolve it, I became frustrated and decided to call it quits,” he told Techpoint. Initial reports had indicated that Paystack had acquired the startup which the former denied. However, Hassan later joined Paystack, where he currently is working as the Product Manager.
 7. GoMyWay (2015  2017)
 GoMyWay was a Nigerian ridesharing platform which shut down its operations at the end of October 2017. The startup cited running out of funding as the reason for shutting down. GoMyWay’s then CEO Damilola Teidi pointed out that the startup couldn’t afford to go forward according to the initial plan of running a free service for a year or two. “It does take a lot of resources to run this business, and the initial plan was no longer sustainable. The shareholders/investors came to a conclusion to shut down operations and close the business as there were no funds to invest further,” Damilola noted at the time. At the point of closure, GoMyWay had received backing from several well-known investors, including Konga’s founder and former CEO Sim Shagaya and former Amazon and Naspers executive Bill Paladino. Damilola later joined Nigeria’s CcHub as the Director of Incubation after GoMyWay folded.
 8. Efritin (2015  2017)
 In January 2017, it was reported that Nigerian e-commerce site for used goods Efritin had shut down its operations and retrenched all its employees in Nigeria – a team of around 50 people. At the time of closing operations, Efritin was owned by Swedish company Saltside Technologies. Nils Hammer, the CEO of Saltside Technologies, cited poor internet penetration and adoption, high cost of data, as well as the challenging economic conditions as major reasons for the startup’s failure. Founded in 2015, Efritin’s former marketing manager Uche Ajene had earlier on accused Somalian national and former MD of Efritin.com, Zakaria Hersi of stealing thousands of dollars, turning a blind eye to internal mismanagement and false fully creating invoice trails.
 9. Bkam (2012  2016)
 By the time of its shutting down, Bkam had raised at least US $500,000 in total funding. Founded in October 2012, Alexandria-based Bkam was one of the first price comparison websites of the region. It was started by Egyptian entrepreneur Mahmoud Abdel-Fattah who was previously working with a local web development agency. After receiving initial investment from an Egyptian entrepreneur and angel investor Osman Ahmed Osman, Bkam went on to raise more from Jabbar Internet Group to expand into Saudi &amp; UAE. Around the same time, some new players entered this space, including Egypt’s Yaoota and Dubai-based Pricena, both of which are still operational. In February 2016, Bkam ran out of funds and decided to shut down its operations. The founder afterwards worked for Careem as a Product Manager for a little over two years and currently leads technology and product at TaskSpotting, a Dubai-based micro-influencer marketing platform for branded content. According to Mahmoud, the startup failed because they couldn’t raise additional investment. “An investor promised $500k, and kept asking for documents for almost 4 months, while we stopped fundraising from other investors,” he told MENAbytes. “During those 4 months, I spent the company’s money and my personal money. Then he disappeared. E-Commerce in Egypt was collapsing, so it was hard to recover quickly.”
 10. Tress (2016  2018)
 The Ghanaian beauty startup was among the first startups from across Africa to get accepted into Y Combinator. However, Tress’ website is no longer available, and it last updated its social media over a year ago, though one of the Co-founders  Priscilla Hazel  still indicates Tress as her current workplace on her LinkedIn. Repeated emails to her company email address to clarify whether they were still in operation or not went unanswered. According to Tress’ Crunchbase profile, they had raised at least US $120,000 in funding.
 11. Podozi (2014  2018)
 Podozi is in the same boat as Tress. In January 2016, the beauty startup which helped one find the right fit beauty products for people of colour announced that it had received $100,000 in a convertible note from 500 Startups. A few months’ before  in October 2015  the startup had also locked in US $20,000 in angel investment. However, its website has since gone down, and the beauty startup last updated its Twitter in May 2016, Facebook in March 2018 and Instagram in December 2018. Both Co-founders  Teniola Adejuwon and Wale Babatunde  still state the startup they founded in 2014 as their current and latest place of work on LinkedIn.
 12. Nefsak (2008  2016)
 In June 2011, Ideavelopers announced that it had made an EGP 10 million ( ~ US $600,000) investment into Egyptian e-commerce startup Nefsak. At the time of the investment, Ideavelopers described Nefsak as the “fastest growing Egyptian online retailer with sales increasing at five times year over year” with an “online catalogue has over 18,000 products covering a wide range of categories from computers and electronics to home decoration and fashion”. There are clear dates of when the startup ceased operations apart from the fact that their website no longer exists. Additionally, Nefsak last updated their Facebook page of more than 1 million followers in September 2016 while their Twitter was last updated on November 2014. Founded in 2008 by Sherif Nassar, Nefsak was among the pioneers of e-commerce in Egypt at that time. Before founding Nefsak, Nassar had worked with 3M, IBM Middle East as well as Lenovo Egypt.
 13. ConnectMed (2016  2019)
 Kenyan healthcare startup ConnectMed is among the latest to shut down across the African continent. In the March 2019 press release that indicated the startup’s shutting down of its operations, Melissa McCoy pointed out that Merck was taking over ConnectMed’s intellectual property including their telehealth solutions. After the handover, Melissa added that “ConnectMed will cease operations”. Over its lifetime, the startup which was founded in 2016, launched three direct-to-consumer digital health products in Kenya and South Africa and served over 8,000 patients, along with corporate clients. It raised over US $300,000 in investment through grants and prizes mainly from the University of Cape Town’s Bertha Centre, University of Oxford’s Skoll Centre, Entrepreneur First and Katapult Accelerator.to
 14. Showroom.ng (2014  2016)
 In an August 2016 Medium blog post, Showroom.ng founder and then CEO Sheriff Shittu announced that he had decided to shut down the startup after 2 years of operation. Sheriff cited a couple of reasons for the startup’s failure summing them up into wrong execution. “I personally won’t attribute the failure to [the] wrong market or wrong product. It was a wrong execution,” he noted. Sheriff Shittu began the furniture marketplace earlier in 2015. Before Showroom, he was a business analyst at Konga for 18 months. He later became the COO of Zima Fashion, a fashion e-commerce store where he continued to function in an advisory capacity after leaving to start Showrooom.ng. In 2015, it was reported that the startup  a Nigerian marketplace for furniture  had raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from local investors.
 15. Nezal (2010  2016)
 Like Nefsak, Nezal was also a portfolio company of Ideavelopers. The startup had set out to make to turn social revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa into games and raised $1 million in Series A investment that was led by Ideavelopers in October 2011. However, the startup’s founder and former CEO, Muhammad Ali, has since moved on to become a product manager at Google. According to Ali’s LinkedIn profile, he indicates that his timeline with the startup he founded in July 2010 ended in April 2016.
 16. Naspers’ e-commerce ventures (2009  2014)
 Africa’s most valuable company by market cap was among the first investors that looked to ride the e-commerce wave across the continent. However, in 2014 the company announced that it was shutting down some of its e-commerce investments in South Africa that were owned through the African division of MIH, the offshore investment arm/holding company of the Naspers Group. The shutdowns focused on a number of its smaller ecommerce properties, including online fashion outlet Style 36, digital camera store SAcamera and baby product outfit Kinderelo as well as furniture site 5Rooms. At the time, Naspers’ spokesperson maintained that they carried out the shutdowns to shift their focus to the more general e-commerce site Kalahari.com, which was founded in 1998. However, the site was later merged with Takealot.com in early 2015. Naspers had established the ventures through AIA accelerator in which it invested through MIH.

"GrowthAfrica’s Acceleration Programme Still Open to Kenyan and Ugandan cohorts.
","GrowthAfrica, a Kenyan based accelerator that helps companies seize and develop business opportunities in Kenya and East Africa, is still receiving applications to its Acceleration programme.
 The objective of this 6 months programme is to scale the ventures, develop entrepreneurial leadership, make it investment ready and then connect it with investors. The target is ambitious, committed and innovative entrepreneurs. In the end, it makes the programme very tasking and demanding.
 Application is open to post-revenue, scalable and innovative ventures which seek to grow exponentially. The acceleration programme was open for applications on 24th January but will close on 12th March at midnight.
 Successful applicants should expect to be led by experienced facilitators who understand the dynamics of running a business and can provide valuable insights to the selected entrepreneurs.

"DTB &#8220;Lowers&#8221; Itself to Uplift Ugandan Entrepreneurs
","This evening, Varghase Thambi, CEO of DTB Uganda, and his management team at DTB Uganda held a session with Ugandan entrepreneurs and innovators at the Innovation Village. This came after he paid a courtesy visit last week during which he was treated to demos of some of the innovators works.
 The event, called DTB for Entrepreneurs, was aimed at helping Varghase and his management team identify the challenges faced by these entrepreneurs and innovators.
 It also doubled as an opportunity to assess the potential of the innovations and startups being worked on by these innovators and entrepreneurs.
 Entrepreneurs present were allowed an opportunity to introduce themselves, a quick mention of what they are working on as well as the main challenges they are currently facing.
 Despite the fact that entrepreneurs present were from differing sectors like Agribusiness, technology, energy etc, they all shared a common challenge  access to financing. They all decried the fact that banks have been of little help when it comes to the issue of raising funding.
 Attendants listening to Varghase Thambi
 However, Varghase promised that this and all the other challenges presented will be handled.
 The event was concluded with a way forward of creating a WhatsApp platform  of which Varghase is a member already. This will be used for making arrangements of meeting him and any other key people at DTB Uganda.
 In a one-on-one conversation with him, he assured us that he is ready to meet and listen to each and every innovator or entrepreneur that will make an effort to see him.
 We came here because we needed to have a specific solution to each problem that they face. We can not use one-size fits all approach  Varghase
 In a separate conversation with CK Japheth, the Co-founder of the Innovation Village, he confirmed that Varghase is open to a walk-in arrangement. Basically, entrepreneurs will be able to meet him with or without appointments.
 Though nothing has materialized yet, we believe this move by DTB Bank will cause other banks and companies to wake up and realize theres potential in local entrepreneurs and innovators that they have ignored for long.
 For now, we would like to say that this gesture  where a bank is willing to stoop low and listen to the challenges that affect not only fully operational businesses but also individuals starting out  has been long due.

"What can i do for you? Speaker Rebecca Kadaga asks Innovators
","Last night, The Innovation Village in Ntinda hosted the Speaker of Parliament Rt. Hon. Rebecca Kadaga. Her visit was centred around a conversation on investing in ideas for Ugandan innovators. The speaker was scheduled to visit during Kampala Innovation Week  which happened a week ago  however, due to unavoidable circumstances, she wasnt able. This she made up last night.
 Upon arrival, Kadaga made a tour of the Innovation Village interacting with several entrepreneurs that explained to her what theyre doing and how it will contribute to the economy. Some of these included Solomon Kitumba from Swipe2Pay, Peter Kisadha Malinz from Startup Digest Africa and others.
 From here, Kadaga visited The Innovation Bureau, which is the wing of the Innovation Village that hosts local and regional companies like Andela, Kola Studios, Xente, !nnovate, ENVentures, Milima Technologies and more. Before settling down for a one-on-one with the already waiting innovators.
 Also read: Communicate in a language that government officials and policymakers understand, Minister Frank Tumwebaze Tells Innovators
 Immediately after CK Japheth, the founder of the Innovation Village, giving opening remarks and introducing her, Kadaga paused a question to the innovators in the room. What do you want from me? To which she encouraged suggestions, questions, comments and opinions.
 
 Is it technological support? Is it money? Be clear. Because right now we are in the process of working on the budget for the next financial year. Therefore, it is important if there are things you want so that we start a conversation and maybe create some money, Kadaga asked.
 
 The first person was CK Japheth who focused on capital. He delved into the importance of access to the right capital for the innovators. He also suggested that there should be more realistic and less deterring criteria for innovators to access capital availed to them by the government.
 For some, it is access to capital and the right type of capital. For example, what is available is the youth venture capital fund with Centenary Bank. But if you look at the criteria for someone to access that, for the startups, it excludes over 90% of them, said Japheth.
 
 Evelyn Namara also added her voice to the issue by suggesting that we need well-defined structures to help us move forward.
 I think we have the money. Theres a recently launched Innovation Fund and Youth [Livelihood] Fund. There are all these funds but the problem is that we do not have the right structures that can really try and help some of us innovators.
 She also suggested that places like Innovation hubs have already helped map out a journey for entrepreneurs. And as it is now, they are able to figure out if youre an early stage startup or at some other stage and whether youre ready for investment.
 
 This is the right place to start and understand are we investing in early stage entrepreneurs or seed stage? The only way you can know is by coming to places like these.
 
 Evelyn concluded by suggesting that such money should then be coming to places like The Innovation Village and other hubs to help them because they already know the entrepreneurs in the space and where to start from.
 More innovators from the audience participated including Allan Rwakatungu from Xente, Evelyn Namara from !nnovate, Peter Malinz Kisadha from Startup Digest Africa and Celina Nalwoga from Milima Technologies.
 Allan Rwakatungu suggested that the government should embrace the culture of making deliberate efforts of getting certain sectors and initiatives to succeed no matter what it takes. He cited the example of the Japanese government that subsidized Toyota for sometime before the now giant automaker could turn a profit.
 For twenty years, Toyota made a loss but the government of Japan had a deliberate policy to make that company and that sector successful. So, in my opinion, itll start from the government. Itd be okay to not look for efficiencies from the beginning. But to be deliberate and say, were going to build a cashless Uganda, Allan said.
 As the conversation continued, it was pointed out that it is also currently hard for startups to get ahold of government contracts even when they can deliver, or are the only ones that can do the job.
 Peter Malinz Kisadha, Founder of Startup Digest Africa, explaining to RT. Hon. Rebecca Kadaga how Startup Digest Africa is helping the Startups where bigger media companies have failed
 Evelyn Namara cited her example of failing to bid for a contract with the Ministry of Agriculture of which shes the only local company that had the solution. But this was because she didnt have a bid security of over UGx. 180,000,000.
 They also cited several barriers like over 7 years in business and audited books of accounts. Which is a tall order for a young company.
 Kadaga agreed with most of the issues raised. Pledging to work closely with her fellows to ensure a more favourable climate is created. She also promised to arrange a meeting with the Minister of Education so that they can better understand the issues at hand.
 She also acknowledged that this is not the first time she was hearing the issues that were being raised, joking that the issues of startups not getting government contract is because you cant afford to pay a bribe.

 Did you know that the bottom of the pyramid of the worlds population has over 5,000,000,000 people? But, most innovators ignore them. Only 4% of the total funds dedicated to innovation go to innovations aimed at this group.
 Yet, around 80% of the funds go to innovators and innovations aimed at the 500,000,000 that make up the top of the pyramid  who are the rich. This was said by R.S Hiremath during the second session.

 On the challenges faced while operating, Sarah Yelpaala  Director Marketing and Strategy at access.mobile International said;
 While seed and angel funding opportunities have grown substantially for African companies over the last five years, there is still a dearth of investment focused on growth stage companies who have a proven solution and model and are seeking capital to scale.
 For access.mobile International, participating in the digital transformation in Africa for the last five years has been and continues to be truly remarkable.

"Tuzuule Set to Help People Find Lost Property
","Tuzuule, a web platform, has launched to help people find their lost property. Starting on November 1st, 2017, people that have lost property will be able to just visit the website and know who to get in touch with.
 The startup is patterning with institutions in a move that is aimed at making the process of finding lost property easy.
 Recently, the Tuzuule team announced a partnership with Kampala Operational Taxi Stages Association (KOTSA).
 In the communication, Tuzuule says that KOTSA operates up to 150 stages in Kampala and have 10 offices where all lost and found properties left in Taxis are collected.
 The partnership will see all properties left behind by passengers posted on their platform.
 So far, on their website, they list GarthDee 506, MTN, Makerere University, KOTSA, Radio One, and Akaboozi as some of the already secured partnerships.
 However, individuals are not allowed to post lost and found property on the platform. Instead, theyre expected to report it to police.
 The startup is hoping to partner with more stakeholders like Police, Taxi and Bus Operating Companies, Banks, City Councils, Airports, Restaurants, Hotels, Hospitals, Schools, Colleges &amp; Universities, Shopping Malls, Public Service Centres, Radio Stations and more where people usually forget their property.
 The partners don’t get to pay anything for the services, but rather the person who lost the property.
 It is not clear whether they go ahead and share the ransom with the institutions that list the properties.

"ResilientAfrica Network Is Not Closing, We Did Not Receive all the $25 Million &#8211; Dr. Mayega
","ResilientAfrica Network  abbreviated as RAN  is a network of different stakeholders including USAID and Universities. The program is spread across 20 African Universities as well as Stanford and The George Washington University.
 Across Africa, it is implemented through 4 regional centers; RAN Universities Eastern Africa Resilience Innovation Lab, centred at Makerere University, Horn of Africa Resilience Innovation Lab, centred at Jimma University in Ethiopia, Southern Africa Resilience Innovation Lab, centred at the University of Pretoria in South Africa and West Africa Resilience Innovation Lab, centred at University for Development Studies in Ghana.
 The reason the network was formed is to get universities to work with development agencies and communities.
 The funders realized that students are involved in many projects of innovation but do them only for academic purposes. After school, they tend not to go ahead and work on them, Dr. Roy Mayega, Deputy Chief of Party at RAN, pointed out.
 Closing?
 There has been a rumor that ResilientAfrica Network is closing after its five-year award from USAID, its main funder, came to an end in October 2017.
 However, Dr. Roy William Mayega, says thats not true. Though he admitted that the first phase of the program came to an end this year and they havent yet received another award to take them through the second one.
 The initial award was a 5-year project, which was supposed to run from 2012 to 2017. It had specific things it was supposed to achieve, Dr. Mayega said.
 Dr. Mayega maintains that RAN is not closing as they have cultivated a great relationship with the partner which is most likely to result in another award.
 Now that phase of the project has ended but as you know how the USAID cycle works, one award ends and when you start a new award you have to get new calls for proposals and then you put in the proposals again, Dr. Mayega added.
 Nonetheless, as they wait for the next call for submission of proposals, theyll continue to operate under what Dr. Mayega called the no-cost extension period.
 This is granted when a project or organization has reserves of funds from the previous project. Therefore, theyll use the remaining funds to help them operate.
 
 The fortunate thing for us is that we do not have to go through that process. We have been given a 5-year no-cost extension. And that is usually done when an organization has developed trust in you, so theyre not going to put out necessarily any public calls so that in case theres a new award to be processed, you just continue, Dr. Mayega.
 
 Instead, Dr. Mayega predicts that RAN is likely to become bigger. We also have other funding sources which are also supporting other ongoing initiatives. So we are not closing as people say. In fact, we are likely to even get bigger, he added.
 The ResilientAfrica Network got funding of $25 Million to run for the 5 five years. Yet, according to Harriet Adong, the Head of PR at RAN, most people think that all the amount went to RAN Universities Eastern Africa Resilience Innovation Lab  which is centered at Makerere University.
 The amount was instead shared amongst the 20 African universities, on top of Stanford and The George Washington University. An amount Dr. Mayega actually thinks is not enough, because when spread, it becomes quite small and thats the challenge.
 In other areas, you see investments of $150 Milion dollars. I think for Innovation and Startups especially that support youths, we need more investment, Dr. Mayega adds.
 So far, RAN has been able to support more than 30 successful innovators from a pool of more than 200 applications. These cut across various sectors with some listed below;
 Matibabu, according to this document dated October 2016, received a grant of USD 75,000. The other is Improved Solar Irrigation Water Pump  a low cost solar powered irrigation pump system for smallholder farmers to engage in agricultural production year-round  having received a grant of USD 50,000.
 Lastly, the document lists RootIO  a community radio that provides a communication platform for communities to engage with different issues ranging from sensitization to transactions  that received a grant of USD 70,000.
 ResilientAfrica Network, according to Harriet Adong, has a number of partnerships lined up. Though theyre all with either the public sector or not-for-profit organizations. Yet, we know the private sector for being lean and agile  something RAN can tap into given it is a not-for-profit itself.
 Dr. Mayega agrees and would relish a partnership with a private sector partner.
 
 That one should actually be the most important type of partnership because we want to develop these [innovations] into viable products and make money. And, the best or least bureaucratic [sector] is the private sector. We are trying to do that, he says.
 
 However, he adds that the slowest types of partnerships to develop here according to our experience has been the private sector.
 Reason being that the private sector here in Africa is not yet tuned to the startup and innovation culture. When the private sector wants something innovative, they organize competitions and fish for how people are doing it. Because they have the money, they start building it in-house. Yet, if they create linkages like in Silicon Valley, they stand to benefit more.
 He advises that private sector needs to put aside funds to support innovators in form of research and development  R&amp;D.
 Right now, when it comes to putting aside funds, they only think of distributing mosquito nets. They need to think in another direction, which is R&amp;D, he added.
 What Dr. Mayega talked about, the habit of private companies fishing for ideas is actually claimed to be a strong and growing vice amongst the private sector  with MTN being the most singled out.
 Read: Does MTN Organize Innovation Awards and Competitions to Steal Ideas?
 ResilientAfrica Network itself hasnt been spared. One innovator, who preferred anonymity, claimed that once one agrees to join RAN, they lose 100% control over their innovation regardless of whether they developed it from there or not.
 Something Dr. Mayega refuted pointing out that actually we dont take anything from anyone. Though. the issue of stealing ideas is one to be given a lot of priority when it comes to sensitization before becomes a deterring factor to innovation.

"Goods Express closed with millions of its shoppers money locked in its wallet
","In November last year, e-Commerce platform Goods Express made an announcement to its Ugandan customers that it was shutting down temporarily.
 However, this eventually turned into a closure from the Ugandan market. To many, the company either rebranded or was acquired by Bazebo  it is hard to tell the difference.
 But, confessions from a couple of customers indicate the process wasnt handled in the best way possible. Additionally, many claim the company could have closed with millions of shillings of its shoppers money in their wallet.
 Before closing, Goods Express advised its customers with cash in its wallet to use it to make purchases. If you have funds in your wallet, you can still use those funds to place an order any time on or before November 10, 2017, Goods Express wrote.
 Alternatively, if one didnt want to place an order or had their order placed but expired  they could opt to withdraw cash. If you decide not to place your order or if the above date has expired, you may log into your wallet and request a cash withdrawal, the company added.

 Yet, according to those I have spoken to, the company acted otherwise and that seems not to have been the case.
 Many of these customers have preferred their identity to be kept anonymous as they signed a tight NDA with Okello Oryem and Advocates, the law firm handling the issue.
 However, Nada Andersen  one of them  opened up to me about the issue and was okay with her identity being revealed.
 According to her, the company said they were just carrying out a restructuring, not closing. They said they were just restructuring and improving the website and this was confirmed by Miloš Ilić (now a Manager at Bazebo according to Nada), she wrote.
 They even went ahead and assured her that all the funds in her wallet would be transferred to the new platform. They gave me information that my wallet will be automatically transferred to the new improved site, Nada said.
 However, that wasnt the case. The company was actually closing. Goods Express stopped working in November last year, she said. And this was just the beginning of a hectic journey to retrieve her cash out of the wallet.
 I called several times from January onwards to find out [about my money], she said. Adding that even her last orders were delayed. I waited for medicine for over two months.
 The staff at that time  perhaps for Bazebo  also did little to help her. Many were telling her they werent working with Goods Express even when the branding there was for Goods Express.
 Staff had mixed and confusing answers because they were saying they had nothing to do with Goods Express yet shops still had the same signage.
 Eventually, she was informed that she had to contact a lawyer. Finally I was told that I need to call a lawyer. Alfred Okello Oryem. Though, he also wasnt receiving her calls, replying to them, her emails or messages.
 I first called, sent emails then almost gave up, she wrote.
 Until she posted everything online, no action had been taken. It was only after blasting Miloš on Facebook that I was able to get a response from Oryem. Maybe a coincidence?
 Like all that received their money, she had to sign a contract  perhaps an NDA  and her cash was remitted. Once Oryem had my details, I had to sign a contract and he then sent me Mobile Money.
 However, this was too much work for someone following up on their payments. Because, according to Nada, she followed up with Okello Oryem for over a month until she gave up.
 I first wrote to the lawyer on 17th January 2018, thereafter wrote a reminder e-mail on 3rd February and 8th February with no response.

 It was only three months later that she was able to get in touch with Okello Oryem. Finally, I got in touch with the lawyer, Mr. Oryem, on 25th May 2018 or thereabouts.
 But even then, she had to do some back and forth as she had to send a boda to his office with a copy of my ID and he had to verify the amount owed to me.
 She finally received her funds in June  which was over 7 months from when the company closed.
 According to Nada, others who were not as tenacious as her or had small amounts in their wallets must have given up altogether. I am sure quite a few people with small balances just gave up chasing, she wrote.
 Having to send a boda with my ID copy, then to sign a contract and send it with a boda  mind you, from town to Ntinda  these are practical issues that not everyone was able to afford.
 She said that Goods Express handled everything very unprofessionally and believes that the company deliberately frustrated their customers.
 This is because Goods Express had an option on the website to request the refund via Mobile Money. However, according to Nada, this never worked yet it was the easiest option.
 This could lead one to think that maybe the company didnt have money to repay those who had already converted their cash into credit.
 Nada also thinks the fall of Goods Express stems from a fall-out between the Ugandan partner with his Nigerian partner.
 The problem stems from the owner, who fell out with his Nigerian partner and decided to set up the same business at the very same premises, employing the very same people.
 She also thinks Bazebo wont be any better given the same people running it are the ones that led Goods Express Uganda to its fall. Unfortunately the same team is running Bazebo now, she wrote.
 At the time we had the WhatsApp conversation [17/07/2018], she had tried placing orders on Bazebo but the experience wasnt pleasing.
 
 I am using Bazebo service for the first time this week [but] website gives you one price [and] when you go to checkout you are slapped with a huge shipping cost. When you finally pay they call you to tell you the item is in Hong Kong and will take six weeks to arrive. Its completely bizarre.
 
 Unfortunately, when we visited Bazebo to clarify the issue, we were informed that it is the CEO  Moses Ihoza  who handles communication and therefore the only person who can comment on the issue.
 They also told me that he was out of the country and would return within a week. That was three weeks ago. Repeated emails to him were ignored.
 This week, when I contacted them again, one of the staff volunteered to tell me that he wont comment on the issue.
 Its unfortunate we are no longer Goods Express and our boss will not be of help for anything related to the company in question. [For] any details required about that company kindly contact the lawyer in charge- Okello Oryem Alfred. He will provide you with [the] necessary information you require, the Bazebo staff wrote.
 However, I had earlier tried contacting Okello Oryem even before having the conversation with Nada Andersen. Though, all my messages and calls have been ignored.
 Yesterday [07/08/2018], I visited the law firms offices in Ntinda twice. The receptionist requested that I leave my contact details behind and Okello would call me. That didnt happen. I tried calling him  twice  my calls were ignored.
 This means I wasnt able to establish exactly how many people had their cash locked in the wallet or how many have been refunded. However, two other people I spoke to had already got their refunds but the process was either worse or the same as Nadas.
 This particular incident should serve as a lesson to all startups when it comes to communication during times when everything seems to be falling apart.
 However, in particular, it should serve as a critical lesson to those running or look to run e-wallets. We all want a cashless economy  because of its benefits  but such incidents will only push users further away from giving up their cash.

"MTN partners with MasterCard to launch mobile money virtual card
","MTN Uganda has today announced a partnership with Mastercard and United Bank for Africa (UBA) aimed at enabling its mobile money users to make payments online.
 The service  dubbed MTN MoMocard  will allow one to create a virtual card using USSD. Then, they will be able to use that card to make online payments to all platforms that accept MasterCard. The virtual card will act the way a debit card is.
 Through this partnership, MTN MoMo customers will use a virtual card to shop or make payments at the vast network of global outlets accepting Mastercard payments, wrote MTN in a press release.
 To access the service, one will part with UGX. 1,000 ($0.26) as a flat fee for a window of 14 days. Then, theyre assigned a 16-digit virtual card number together with the CVV (security code) number sent via an SMS notification.
 Implying that one will have to request for a different card number and CVV every 14 days. As long as they are interested in transacting online using the service.
 This is hectic but were a USSD market (for now) thus, many would be willing to overlook that part.

 Apart from the $0.26, the users will also pay a fee equal to 3% of each transaction amount, for every transaction. This is competitive, compared to the alternatives. VISA, for example, charges an average of 2.00%  plus $0.10  per transaction.
 Like Tidal and other recent products that MTN has launched, this is aimed at the younger population that might not have got ahold of a card yet. Implying that one wont ever need to walk to a bank to request for one.

"Rwanda-based startup ARED sets up shop in Uganda with backing from Gray Matters Capital coLABS
","ARED, the Rwanda based Platform as a Service start-up known for its ‘Smart Business in a Box solar-powered kiosks, recently announced that it had set up 10 such kiosks with 10 women micro franchisees; thereby marking its expansion into its first international market – Uganda.
 The solar kiosks, known as the Shiriki Hubs, are run by women and differently-abled individuals on a micro-franchisee model. These have been set up in Kampala as well as in the refugee camps of Arua district through which citizens belonging to lower income groups can charge their mobile devices and buy air-time.
 These kiosks also have WiFi connectivity, enabling people to access the internet, make digital payments as well as a host of other intranet services offline.
 This expansion into Uganda was funded by US-based impact investor Gray Matters Capital under its gender lens sector agnostic portfolio  coLABS in July 2017.
 Impact on the community
 The impact ARED has on the community within which it operates could be simply termed as solar powered gendered impact.
 With its funding mandate met after piloting in Uganda for a little more than a year, and achieving impact with 48 kiosks is Rwanda – 41 of which are run by women and 2 by people with disabilities – ARED is now aiming to have 100 micro franchisees serving around 3000 customers a month by 2020 with this market expansion.
 The startup presently provides digital services and meets the connectivity needs of 55,000 customers in Rwanda and Uganda, using its solar-powered kiosks.
 Entry and penetration in new markets
 Giving insights into his company’s development strategy for Uganda, Henri Nyakarundi – Founder and CEO, ARED Group said, “We will work with partners whom we call as [sic] area developers who will franchise our model in the different areas of Uganda.
 “Our focus is on NGOs and private sector enterprises whom we’d like to be roped in [sic]. They will buy the hardware  the kiosk; train micro franchisees and use our licensed software. ARED will, of course, support them along the way.
 Apart from leasing the kiosks via the franchise model, ARED is also planning to partner telecom service providers in Uganda to build distribution channels at the community level.
 Commenting on ARED’s success, Jennifer Soltis, Portfolio Manager – coLABS, Gray Matters Capital said, “ARED has revolutionized the way digital services and connectivity is being distributed in low-income areas, and we are happy to have played our part in its success so far.
 Henris entrepreneurial zeal coupled with a passion for social impact by empowering women and the differently abled through a profitable micro-franchise model that pays a commission for every service sold is remarkable.
 Sights on the future
 While the rationale behind entering Uganda was the similarity of culture and proximity to Rwanda, ARED will be embarking on a far more challenging journey next year.
 The company has trained its sights on the West African social space.
 “We will be looking to target countries in Western Africa next year. While the cultural ethos may differ, what remains common pan-Africa is the unreliability of power supply. It is this adversity that we’d like to convert into an opportunity,” said Henri announcing that ARED has begun working on a pilot in Ivory Coast.
 Founded in 2013, ARED is a Platform as a Service company based in Rwanda with operations in Uganda. It has developed a ‘Smart Business in a Box solar kiosk, app, and software platform that empowers mostly women and people with disabilities using a micro-franchise business model.
 This puts it on a storied list of African startups that are trying to have a positive impact on society through their tech and business. In mid-February, these companies converged in Kigali, Rwanda to look over the challenges and possible opportunities to rectify the problems in the startup scene.
 Among the attendees were ARED’s compatriots Exuus and Leaf who are making strides in ensuring financial inclusion for everyone in the country.
 With Uganda sharing similar challenges to Rwanda, it is evidently more than geographical proximity that caught the eye of the startup.

 With a population of at least 150 million, East Africa (Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) is proving to be an appealing market for ride-hailing products. For example, in less than 5 years, at least 8 ride-hailing companies have launched in the region.
 Here is a look at each and their current level of coverage in the region.
 Taxify
 The Estonian ride-hailing company opened its first East African office in Nairobi in May 2016. This was after setting up its operations in South Africa as its first market on the continent. Yet, Taxify was the second in the Kenyan market after Uber and Mondo.
 It followed up its Kenyan launch with a rapid expansion into Kampala and Dar es Salaam in October and December 2017, respectively. Currently, the company has operations in only three East African countries.

 Taxify, which counts Chinese Didi Chixung and Daimler among its investors, has not yet given a clear overview of its statistics about the number of drivers, riders or amount of trips taken. Metrics that have been popularized by Uber.
 Mondo Ride
 Founded in Dubai but headquartered in Nairobi, Mondo has been in existence for a little over 2 years. The ride-hailing company launched its cab business in Nairobi in mid-2016. Afterward, it launched a motorcycle hailing service towards the end of the same year.
 To date, Mondo has raised at least $5 million in funding. $2 million of this came in early this year with the aim of expanding into 6 cities  Kampala and Dar es Salaam included. The company thus currently has operations in Dar es Salaam, Kampala, and Nairobi.
 Little
 Launched at the beginning of 2016 in Nairobi, Little  backed by Safaricom  has steadily grown to become another fierce Uber competitor in East Africa. The company expanded to Kampala in April this year.
 This, they followed with the sale of 10% stake to an unnamed Indian investor for $3 million in June this year with an aim to expand into more cities. Currently, there is a plan to expand into Kigali.
 Uber
 Uber officially launched in Nairobi in June 2015, following launches in South Africa, Nigeria, and Egypt. Having undergone primary tests within the city, the Nairobi launch was also the initiation of cash payments for Uber Africa.
 A year later, the company followed up its Kenya launch with a launch in two other markets of Kampala and Dar es Salaam. Both in June 2016.

 There have been reports of the company withdrawing from the African market, though it has largely denied them. In fact, last week, there were reports of the company entering the Rwandan market.
 SafeBoda
 The Uganda-headquartered startup was founded in late 2014. SafeBoda is the pioneer of boda-boda ride-hailing in East Africa. Until early this year, the startup was only operational in Kampala.
 But, thanks to a $1.1 million investment that they received earlier this year, SafeBoda recently expanded to Nairobi. Making it their second market. I dont think they are likely to consider Kigali (in the near future)) given it already has incumbents like SafeMotos and YegoMotos. Instead, they might be looking at Nigeria and other markets.
 SafeBoda has come under tough competition in Uganda with both Uber and Taxify cloning and each launching a similar boda hailing service earlier this year.
 SafeMotos and YegoMotos
 Like SafeBoda, SafeMotos has grown to become the anecdote market leader in Rwandas boda-boda hailing scene. Founded in 2014 by Barrett Nash and Peter Kariuki, the startup is only operational in Rwanda.
 Similarly, YegoMoto, a product of Yego Innovision Ltd, is a boda-boda hailing startup with operations only in Rwanda. Though, according to the Head of Transport at Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency, Eng. Emmanuel Asaba, Yego was given a license to venture into cabs with Yego Cab.
 Others
 Beyond the above, there are some operators who are either largely in one city or across borders but on a much smaller scale compared to the above.
 This includes AfriTaxi which was formerly called 250Taxi. It was launched in Kigali, in February 2016 by Afshon Wallace Ngige and later that year expanded into the Zimbabwean market with the launch of 263 Taxi. Zip Taxi is another player in the space in Rwanda.
 While Twende in Tanzania was launched in February last year by Tigo, the countrys leading telecom company together with Justin Kashaigili. Early this year, Dial Jack also launched in Kampala to rival SafeBoda in the boda-boda hailing space.
 In Nairobi, Ekorent Africa launched Nopia ride earlier this month with the selling point of environmentally friendly vehicles.

"Dr. Proscovia Mugaba: The first Fully Accredited Female Cardiologist in Uganda
","At the end of April 2017, Dr. Proscovia Mugaba completed her training to become a Pediatric Cardiologist from an accredited training program at the University of Alberta in Canada, after 3 years of intensive training.
 This comes at a time when there is a drive to encourage girls and women to become more involved in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics  often abbreviated as STEM.
 Shortly upon her return to Uganda, we had a telephone interview with Dr. Mugaba in which she detailed her journey – the ups and downs – with the hope that this will inspire the next breed of girls to follow her path or, a greater one.
 Pediatric Cardiology
 According to Dr. Mugaba, a Pediatric Cardiologist is a doctor with specialized training to provide care to children with heart disease. To attain this qualification, a doctor should have had training in pediatrics, which means that they are specialized in taking care of children. As a pediatrician, one then gets additional training to enable one to take care of children with heart disease.
 The scope of work of a Pediatric Cardiologist includes taking care of patients with known heart disease, those with suspected or those at risk of developing heart disease, and those who have received treatment for heart disease and requiring follow-up care.
 Depending on one’s scope of training and the healthcare structure, the scope may include providing care to adults born with heart disease.
 The first
 To the best of her knowledge, Dr. Proscovia Mugaba is the first female Pedriatic Cardiologist in Uganda. Currently, there are at least 2 other physicians offering pediatric cardiology services at the Uganda Heart Institute (UHI), and a few other pediatricians who are undergoing apprenticeship training at UHI to obtain the experience required to provide pediatric cardiology services in Uganda.
 There is currently no accredited training program for this specialty in Uganda. Hence, with respect to completing training in an accredited program, Dr. Mugaba has had a unique opportunity.
 Regionally…
 Dr. Mugaba explained that in the East African region, It is scarce to find doctors specialized in this field. Kenya is perhaps slightly ahead of Uganda when it comes to the number of Pediatric Cardiologists who obtained their training in an accredited training program.
 Tanzania probably has none while Rwanda only has a few people offering services in this specialty. Similarly, Sudan has only two paediatric cardiologists while South Sudan has none.
 According to Dr. Mugaba, with the current initiative at the UHI allowing for apprenticeship training, we shall soon have at least 5 pediatric cardiologists in Uganda. She urges that people like her who have completed the accredited training should go ahead and facilitate the training of other individuals interested in this specialty.
 From left to right: Kondwani Kawaza, Hellen Aanyu, Albert Kamugisha, Rachel Mlotha, Martin Situma, Polly Okello, Stanley Machoki, Proscovia Mugaba
 Journey
 Dr. Mugaba finished her undergraduate medical training in 2003, from Makerere University; followed by a year of internship required to practice as a medical doctor in Uganda. Her first job following qualification in 2004, was as a medical officer at a rural missionary hospital called Kiwoko Hospital, Nakaseke district in Uganda.
 After about a year, she left Kiwoko hospital to enrol for a Masters in Medicine Degree, specializing in pediatrics, at Makerere University from 2005 to 2008. It was during her pediatrics training that she developed a keen interest in pediatric cardiology.
 Upon completing her pediatrics training in July of 2008, she was offered a job as a Research Coordinator  for a Research Project of Makerere University, involving children. This project was based in Mbale, in Eastern Uganda. She worked in this position for two years.
 During this time, she remained optimistic to get an opportunity to pursue her goal of becoming a Pediatric Cardiologist.
 In 2010, she was offered a scholarship to do a clinical fellowship in pediatric cardiology at the University of Cape Town, at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital  one of the largest and best children’s hospital in Africa.
 During this training, she worked alongside the team taking care of children with various heart diseases in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Initially, her funding was for one year but this was later extended for another 6 months to help her consolidate her experience.
 This 18 months’ training made her one of those with the longest training exposure in an accredited training program in her field in Uganda, where typically, others would have had a year or less of such exposure.
 Upon completing this fellowship, her supervisor in Cape Town emphasized that her training was intended to equip her to work as a pediatrician taking care of children with heart diseases, but it was not to endorse her as a cardiologist.
 Although she could have provided pediatric cardiology services in Uganda, she was not satisfied with settling at this level as her goal was to become an accredited Pediatric Cardiologist.
 Despite not getting the opportunity to do the full training in Cape Town, she emphasizes how grateful she is for this opportunity and the doors of that were opened following this.
 Getting accredited…
 After her training in Cape Town, she remained hopeful to get an opportunity for the complete training to become a Pediatric Cardiologist.
 Incidentally, it was during her training in South Africa that she met a Pediatric Cardiologist from Canada, called Dr. Ian Adatia, who asked about her career ambitions. Dr. Adatia was, at the time, the head of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at the Stollery Children’s Hospital in Canada where Dr. Mugaba has just completed her training.
 When she first met Dr. Adatia, she discussed with him about her desire of becoming a pediatric cardiologist and the limitations she faced such as the lack of an accredited training program in Uganda, and the limited opportunities in Africa, in general.
 It was Dr. Adatia who advised her to consider applying to the university of Alberta in Canada and also introduced her to the program director at the University of Alberta where she was subsequently invited to submit her application and after a series of interviews, she was  offered a fully-funded scholarship to enrol into the pedaitric pardiology program at University of Alberta.
 Getting this training opportunity made her the first non-North American to be accepted into this program at this University. In addition, receiving a fully funded scholarship from the University was exceptional in itself, perhaps one of the first ever offered to a non-Canadian for this training at this University.
 Aware of this unique opportunity, she embarked on her training, determined to do everything on her part to keep this door open for others who would come after her.
 Challenges
 One of the major challenges Dr. Mugaba faced during her training in Canada was related to her being a doctor from a developing country  it was not uncommon to find individuals who expressed doubt in her capabilities to effectively work in a developed setting.
 Despite this, however, at the end of her training, her seniors and colleagues bade her farewell with confidence in her capability in this specialty.
 Highlights
 In her first year of training in Canada, Dr. Mugaba was awarded the Neal Gupta Award in Pediatric Cardiology which, not only was financially beneficial but, was also a huge boost to her confidence coming from a developing country to work for the first time in a highly competitive field of medicine in a developed country.
 This annual award, worth 5000 Canadian Dollars, is an Educational Award given to a trainee in the Pediatric Cardiology Program at the University of Alberta for outstanding communication skills including bedside manners, respect for patients and the ability to explain.
 One of her biggest highlights is having her two babies during the time of training in Canada although it was challenging to balance having a family and completing her training, and her training period had to be extended by a few extra months of maternity leave.
 Dr. Mugaba is grateful to her family, especially her husband; as well as friends, mentors and supervisors who have supported her to ensure she attains this achievement.
 When asked about her future plans, she remains open to all opportunities as long as they are aimed at supportive to the growth of those in her field of expertise.
 She concludes by encouraging young girls to remain confident and take up more roles and training in STEM. She also promises to contribute to capacity building in her area of expertise, as opportunity will arise.

"Opting for convertible debt financing? Here are some key terms you should know
","Previously an article on startup jargon founders need to know as they raise funds for their company was published here. I would like to contribute to this by including below some key jargons associated with term sheets, especially convertible debt.
 A term sheet will usually be negotiated, like all financing term sheets, after a pitch deck has been shared, all the questions and due diligence have been done. Just when you thought it was going to get easier!
 Term sheets vary depending on the type of financing being sought ie equity, debt, convertible debt. One of my favorite form of investing is through convertible debt. For those who do not know about convertible debt, there is a primer here.
 Convertible debt suits early stage businesses as it offers flexibility by providing financing now while allowing a fair valuation of a business to be determined at a later date. If, hopefully, the valuation of the business goes up then the founders are not diluted as much.
 In addition, if the interest payments on the debt are accrued and rolled up, the cash flow effects are the same as equity. While still providing tax benefits as the interest payable on debt instruments is tax deductible. [Caveat: This may not fully apply in Uganda as there are limits on allowable interest deductible for tax purposes].
 The term sheet forms the basis for the convertible debt agreement or Convertible Debt note which is signed between the Company/Issuer and the Investor.

 But, what are the key terms to negotiate or understand when you decide to consider a convertible debt term sheet? Find them below;
 Issuer/Obligor: The Company seeking convertible debt.
 Investor(s): Investor buying or investing as convertible debt.
 Amount/ Instrument: Amount of financing being sought, convertible debt is unsecured convertible promissory notes (the “Notes”). In other words, the debt is secured against a promise to pay back in the future or convert into equity in the business, the Principal.
 Purpose: The reasons for which the convertible debt is required, usually accompanied by an investment plan/company business plan.
 Unsecured Security Interest: Convertible debt is generally an unsecured obligation of the Company.
 Issue Date: Days from the signing of the term sheet that the convertible debt is provided to the Company.
 Maturity Date: Period from the issue date by which the convertible debt must be paid back or converted into equity.
 Coupon/ Interest: [X]% per year, with the option to capitalize into the Note’s principal. The interest that shall be applicable per year on the convertible debt, there is an option to capitalize the debt into the Principal. Typically a [Y%] per year default penalty may apply if the Coupon/Interest is not paid.
 Payment Dates: Dates on which the interest and/ or Principal will be paid.
 Interest: This may be quarterly on the amount outstanding at the start of the quarter, paid in arrears.
 Principal: This may be paid all at maturity but the Issuer may reserve the right to prepay with no prepayment penalty.
 Ranking: This defines the hierarchy convertible debt holders will have in event of repayment of obligations. Ordinarily, holders of the convertible debt notes shall be subordinated (paid after) to any credit or debt facility issued by a bank or other lending institution to the Company. However, equity investors are subordinated to convertible debt holders.
 Mandatory Conversion: It is typical for convertible debt to automatically convert to equity at the Conversion Price upon a Qualified Financing.
 “Qualified Financing” means a transaction or series of transactions for the purpose of raising capital pursuant to which the Company issues and sells shares of its stock for an aggregate gross of an agreed amount (this excludes all proceeds from the conversion or cancellation of the Notes into stock).
 Also read: Take a look at these 14 Y Combinator graduates from Africa
 Conversion Price upon a Qualified Financing: The Conversion Price for convertible debt when Qualified finance occurs is usually defined as the lesser of (i) a set [%] (the “Conversion Discount”) of the share price paid by the investor(s) in the Qualified Financing, % depending on the stage of the business and (ii) the price per share equal to a set amount, [$], divided by the aggregate number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of immediately prior to the Qualified Financing (inclusive of all convertible and exercisable securities then outstanding (the “Valuation Cap”).
 The Conversion Discount and Valuation Cap are the key terms usually negotiated in a Convertible Debt Termsheet.
 Voluntary Conversion: The Notes may be converted into Ordinary shares at the option of the Investor upon announcement by the Company of a “Change of Control”. An example of “Change of Control” may mean:
 “Change of Control” means either: (i) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation or stock transfer, but excluding any such transaction effected primarily for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company), unless the Company’s stockholders of record immediately prior to such transaction or series of related transactions hold, immediately after such transaction or series of related transactions, at least 50% of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity (provided that the sale by the Company of its securities for the purposes of raising additional funds shall not constitute a Change of Control hereunder); or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.
 The Conversion Price applicable upon a Change of Control shall be a set [%] of the share price paid in the transaction resulting in the Change of Control.
 Covenants: The Note will contain standard affirmative (do’s)and negative (dont’s) covenants for a financing of this type, including but not limited to the following.
 Affirmative covenants will require the Issuer to: continue its corporate existence; comply with applicable law; pay taxes; protect its intellectual property; prepare financial reports [in accordance with financial reporting standards] on a quarterly basis and annual reports [AUDITED] by an outside accountant.
 Also read: This is how Matibabu has evolved since its founding 5 years ago
 Negative covenants will forbid the Issuer to: change its business or enter a new line of business; dispose of its assets other than in the ordinary course of business [and not to exceed a set amount, in the aggregate]; enter into any agreement to merge or combine with another company; make any acquisition of another company, its business or assets [except for certain purchases of inventory in the ordinary course of business]; issue dividends, stock repurchases or redemptions, make payments with respect to subordinated debt, or make other restricted payments exceeding a certain amount; Make any loans or investments exceeding a certain amount [other than in the ordinary course of business]; incur any lien or make any negative pledge, other than mechanics’ liens in favor of suppliers incurred in the ordinary course of business; incur any additional indebtedness, including guaranties, sale-leasebacks, and other contingent obligations exceeding a certain amount [other than in the ordinary course of business]; increase the size of its Board of Directors beyond [number of] members; increase the annual cash compensation for any employee by more than set [%] over the previous year
 Conditions Precedent to Disbursement: These are the terms required to be fulfilled prior to the investment/money being disbursed for the convertible debt. These may be determined following due diligence on the Issuer
 Events of Default: These include actions that if they occur, are considered to be a breach of the convertible debt terms, may include: Failure to pay; Continuous breach of any other material representation or warranty; and Bankruptcy or insolvency.
 Confidentiality: The terms of this term sheet shall be kept confidential by the parties for one year from the date of its delivery to the investor. Neither party shall disclose (directly or indirectly) without the prior written consent of the other party, these terms to a third party (other than the employees, lenders, owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party, provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except in order to comply with any applicable law, order, or regulation.

 Governing Law: The Law of the Country that will apply, for example, Uganda. The Law that shall govern disputes and arbitration.
 Transfer/Conversion Terms: Define the conditions governing transfer and or conversion of the convertible debt. The transfer and conversion may be subject to some restrictions for example: i) a minimum convertible or transferable amount say [$10,000] Notes at a time; ii) the holding of/or sale of the equity to an entity in violation of Country laws may not be permitted; iii) transfer without the prior written consent of Company may result in a loss of right to convert to shares.

"This is where the standoff between UCC and Pay TV operators&#8217; leaves the consumers
","
 According to a joint press release by Pay Tv operators in Uganda, the Ugandan Communications Commission, UCC, is after them. The press release makes reference to a UCC directive dated April 20, 2018, that labeled them non-compliant.
 
 UCC also went ahead and advised the public not to deal with the Pay TV operators. As if that wasnt enough, the commission is apparently developing a new licensing framework.
 The UCC Is in the process of developing a new licensing framework, on which we were in the process of engaging the regulator to ensure that the framework is enabling and appropriate, read part of the statement.
 Among the proposals in the framework is a hike in the license fees. One of the UCCs changes to the licensing framework was to increase the annual license fees payable by Pay TV operators by an exorbitant 2400% from Shs 22 million (USD 5950) to Shs 550 million (USD 151,000).
 On top of that, the Pay TV operators will be required to part with 2% of their Gross Annual Revenue and any existing regulatory fees remain in force. Across the region, Kenya charges 0.5% of the gross annual turnover while Tanzania charges 0.8%.
 Amidst all this, Pay TV operators made it clear in the joint press release that they will pass on any increment in the fees to the final consumer.  Pay TV operators will have no choice but to pass on these increased fees to subscribers if we are to survive, part of the statement read. Though, they also noted that they  are reluctant to do [so] as it would make Pay TV Services affordable and place an additional burden on consumers.
 But, just in case the frameworks come to pass, what should you, as a consumer of Ugandas Pay TV expect?
 Also read: UCC goes after bloggers, digital media and other online publishers
 The most obvious is a hike in fees. If the operators are facing a 2400% increment in their fees as well as giving away 2% of their Gross Annual Revenue, expect at least 2400% increase in your current package price. If you have been paying 10,000 per month, then expect to pay at least 30,000 per month for your package.
 Heres how it will work; a 2400% increase in your package a year is 240,000. The operator will spread this over a period of 12 months given the license is annual. Implying that youll pay at least 20,000 per month. When you add that 20,000 to the 10,000 youre currently paying, then youll arrive at the 30,000.
 Secondly, a monopoly  especially of DSTV, is likely to emerge. When you anecdotally look at the target audience most of the operators, it is the bottom of the pyramid. With the exception of DSTV. DSTV, having the English Premier League and a more financially stable audience can survive this. But, after it has created a monopoly, then Ugandans would be subject to all the adverse effects it comes with.
 Case in point is when GTV pulled out of the African market, DSTV immediately gained a monopoly on the English Premier League broadcasting rights. And soon after hiked their subscription prices.
 In the end, the dilemma will be whether to own a Pay Tv or not. Especially for the bottom of the pyramid. Given that the much-touted free-to-air option could have been a pipe dream that many local channels are not willing to commit to. Maybe, they will resort to options like the illegal broadcasting services such as Bein.
 For the internet savvy middle-income consumers, theres an alternative of live streaming. Local channels like NTV and NBS TV are already live streaming their programs through YouTube.
 Additionally, a recent influx of on-demand Internet content platforms like ShowMax, Netflix, Iflix, and iROKO might see them switch to such options. These services cost between UGX 27,000 to UGX 30,000 per month for unlimited viewing. Depending on the package you opt.

"Connect Kampala: By 2022 we shall have resolved most of the transport issues, Martin Ssekajja &#8211; KCCA
","Martin Ssekajja, the KCCAs deputy director of ICT, today [28/01/2018] at Connect Kampala hackathon was quoted saying that by 2022, we shall have resolved most of the transport issues. In his speech, Martin also added that KCCA already has a smart city strategy and we have implemented some components.
 A city of an estimated 1.5 Million residents and 4.2 million that enter it every day, it surely faces a lot of transport challenges. According to KCCA, the city was designed to cope with about 45,000 vehicles, yet those that enter the city daily are more than two million, including taxis and private vehicles.
 Martin also added that there will be 10 Million people in the greater Kampala by 2040. Currently, Kampala contributes over 60% of the countrys GDP. But, this New Vision article estimates that traffic jam [in Uganda] eats up Shs. 2.8 trillion every year. Which is roughly 10% of Ugandas budget.
 Traffic jam and other transport related problems like a universal address system are some of the issues the three-day hackathon at Outbox, which ran from January 26  28, 2018 sought to address.
 The Connect Kampala Hackathon required the participating Software Developers to design solutions to improve the transport system in Kampala with WhereIsMyTransport Public Transport and Facebook Places APIs.
 Several teams signed up for the hackathon, though only 10 made it to the finals. The team of three judges that decided the ultimate winner was led by Marsh Reddy, from WhereIsMyTransport.

 Entabula Yo [meaning your movement], which worked on addressing the local address system as well as PakMe which designed a platform for allowing one to book a parking spot came in at number one and two respectively.
 The first team walked away with $1000 USD, while second and third place won Facebook coupons to the value of an additional $500 each.
 It should be noted that KCCA has invested heavily in the street address system, therefore working with Entambula Yo might be one of the ways to make it better. The same solution being presented by Entambula Yo was worked on by a startup called Arvana incubated at ResilientAfrica Network that won a grant in the range of $5000  $7000 before it dissolved last year.
 The new KCCA Street address mapping
 Martin, commenting on the issue of location said that they have adopted geo-referenced street mapping to enable e-commerce as well. However, South African WumDrop which was acquired by Makro has demonstrated that it is possible to enable e-commerce by turning ones phone into an address. And, we are known for having mobile phones. The team might also want to check out how What3Words does.
 When it comes to PakMe, actually there are apps doing that already. For example ParkMe (where they seem to have got the name from), JustPark, ParkWhiz and more. Though it doesnt matter where the idea came from. In the end, execution and how it fits into the market is what matters.
 Connect Kampala is part of the many hackathon series being carried out across several cities on the African continent in partnership. Theyll take place throughout January up to April 2018 in Kampala, Nairobi, Gauteng, Kigali and Dar es Salaam.

"The Medical Concierge Group has raised $200,000 as it marks its 5th birthday
","The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG), which celebrated its 5th birthday last week, has announced that it recently closed $200,000 in equity angel investment. The company preferred to keep the details of the investor(s) undisclosed.
 However, this is just a part of the entire amount the “consortium of innovative ventures in healthcare” is looking to raise.
 “The round is not closed and still underway in an effort to raise 1 million USD before the close of 2018,” Dr. Davis Musinguzi, a co-founder and the Managing Director of TMCG, wrote to us in an email.
 This is the first round of equity investment the group is raising as it has been primarily bootstrapped for the past 5 years as well as funded through grants and contracts they’ve been able to secure along the way.
 Also read: This is how Matibabu has evolved since its founding 5 years ago
 Dr. Musinguzi believes the investment coming in at their 5th birthday signifies the level of maturity they have reached as well as the confidence all their stakeholders have in them.
 “It signifies a new level of maturity of the company and the team’s confidence in the value we can deliver not only to our users, customers, and partners but also to shareholders and investors.”
 He also believes that for TMCG to raise this amount, it means there’s hope for founders in the health tech industry in Uganda. However, having taken 5 years to notch it, Dr. Musinguzi added that it should also communicate to the same founders that “there are no shortcuts to get there.”
 TMCG is looking to use the funds to expand its services. According to Dr. Musinguzi, the expansion will be in the areas of staffing as well as deliveries.
 The Medical Concierge Group team.
 “[The funds will go] into [the] expansion of the teleconsultation service with TMCG Doctors and Pharmacists as well as on-demand medicine deliveries and laboratory (lab) sample pickups,” Dr. Musinguzi wrote.
 Additionally, the company is looking to introduce another line of services that will be powered by AI and blockchain. Perhaps that is why they are looking for a senior software developer to hire.
 “TMCG is expanding its digital health offerings to include Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies with on-demand clinical services to achieve a superior end-to-end healthcare experience,” he wrote.
 
 “The customer will be able to have a remote consultation with our Doctors or AI chatbot and where appropriate get an e-Lab request and e-prescriptions. Customers will be able to make payments through mobile money, their insurer, credit/debit cards or cash. All this data will be stored in a secure blockchain health record.”
 
 According to Dr. Musinguzi, their on-demand service will see them use “medically trained professionals” to deliver medicines to homes, workplaces or schools or in the case of labs, pick up your sample and report the results remotely.
 “This also means patients with chronic diseases especially Diabetes and Hypertension, largely excluded from health insurance, can subscribe to a plan that offers the convenience of discounted medicines getting delivered and lab samples like blood, urine etc picked up for routine tests”
 Founded in 2012 and publicly launched in 2013, TMCG’s journey has been long and hard yet exciting as Dr. Musinguzi described it.

 Along the way, the company has forged a couple of partnerships which have been pivotal to their survival in certain cases.
 “We have made key partnerships on long-term projects that make it possible to evaluate the adoption and impact of digital health in public and private, rural and urban settings as well as in clinical research and development,” Dr. John Mark Bwanika, co-founder, and Director at TMCG wrote.
 The company also has operations in Kenya and Nigeria and is currently “adding critical human resources and technologies to support this growth in-country and abroad.”
 TMCG’s work on the impact of medical call centers on engaging men in HIV prevention, care and treatment was recently showcased at the International AIDS Society conference in Amsterdam, the world’s largest gathering of HIV/AIDS professionals and organizations.

"Uber re-brands with new and simpler logo
","Last week, Uber unveiled its new identity with a new and simpler logo. The company dropped their previous all-caps logo and opted to go with a custom typeface that has only the U in caps. People wondered where the U went, Ubers design team wrote on their website.
 According to the company, the new design is meant to reflect the companys growing diversification from what it set out to be.
 Plus, the company says that it has become a household name and would want to reflect that. In the process, they decided to go with a word-mark rather than a symbol for all their branding.
 Our logo is approachable, easy to read, and takes full advantage of our name recognition, the company said. Though one can interpret it as the once-embattled company trying to evolve and move away from its past.
 Ubers new logo.
 This is the companys first major rebrand in the last two years. Ubers last rebranding attempts came in 2016 under the leadership of co-founder, Travis Kalanick. The company adopted two icons, which represented the company and its partners.
 Travis also pointed out that the company was rebranding to enable people to see the company from afar as well as to reflect a more substantial look as we too have matured as a company.

 The rebrand was carried out by Ubers Brand Experience team, MCKL Type Foundry, and Wolff Olins  a London headquartered brand consultancy firm. According to Wolff Olins, the company had outgrown its logo.
 Uber old logo
 Uber went from a startup connecting riders and drivers to a global mobility platform in eight short years, they noted. This is because they have grown to embrace new and future modes of transportation—from bikes to tuk-tuks, to flying cars, it needed a holistic brand system to accommodate them all.
 Wolff Olins portfolio includes clients like Microsoft, Alibaba, Spotify, GrubHub, AOL and more.

"Someone ought to start policing Ugandan [tech] startups, Now!
","A big part of the problem facing the tech startup scene is the disturbing absence of constructive criticism from within and without the startup ecosystem. Phrases like brilliant app, revolutionary idea and amazing concept that are made with no solid basis, are stunting the growth and development of startups (if they even deserve to be referred to as such).
 All over the world, every industry that thrives has systems in place that are designed to provide quality assurance…checks and balances, if you will.
 The film industry in the US (Hollywood) has a proper balance of reward and castigation; there are meticulously organised awards for the best and worst movies and actors every year. This culture guarantees that everyone gives their best self to the cause.
 Restaurants in the west are inspired to be their absolute best, all in a quest to earn the prestigious Michelin stars. If a restaurateur were to get things horribly wrong and serve underwhelming food to their guests, they would be sure to find scathing reviews of their restaurant in lifestyle publications; heck, they could even lose a star. It’s this system of checks and balances that keeps everyone at their best.
 Motoring shows like BBC’s Top Gear and Amazon’s The Grand Tour have dedicated their very existence to candidly reviewing cars made by “big” and “small” car brands alike; they will call anyone out and show them their car’s flaws. The companies recognise the value of constructive criticism, which is why season after season, they offer their cars to the showrunners for testing no matter how scathing the reviews get.
 Mindset shift
 What we need to do as Ugandans is stop the culture of seeking political correctness every time we speak. We cannot get better as a people if we applaud every effort, however pathetic. We need to learn the benefits of brutal honesty with regards to helping startups grow.
 For as long as I’ve followed Ugandan tech startup news, I’m yet to see a single criticism of any Ugandan startups or their products. All anyone does is publish article ’pon article, filled with praise for non-functional or imaginary products. Granted, there are those who have done the hard work and have created (truly) amazing products…these should get the credit that they deserve.
 However, those who have not done enough to be lauded, should be served a healthy dish of constructive criticism while taking care not to trash the idea/product (unless absolutely necessary) as this could break spiritsyou don’t want that.
 So, who does the policing?
 The simple answer, everyone! The saying goes, it takes a village…
 For purposes of clarity though, I will break it down so that no one claims they do not know their role;
 
 Media
 
 The members of the media fraternity shoulder a lot of the blame for the current state of the tech landscape. Young tech entrepreneurs have turned into fame-hogs, always craving their next appearance on tv, newspaper articles, tech blogs, name it!
 It’s only natural for the tech entrepreneurs to lust for fame &amp; name recognition and, an argument could be made that it helps them push their products (for those who have actual products). The onus is on the journalists who write the features for all these amazing innovations to test the products and verify that they work (if any such claims were made by the developers). If a product is still at concept level, it’s the journalist’s duty to follow the journey of said product, and report on any and all progress.
 The media has the power to keep tech entrepreneurs honest and so it should.
 
  Judges at hackathons
 
 I’ve been to a number of hackathons, organised by by various companies — both as a participant and member of the audience. On the whole, these turn out as an embarrassment to hackathons everywhere, here’s why:
 
 Winners are (always) chosen based on a couple of presentation slides and technical demonstrations are ignored. This is the birthplace of technically inept startups.
 Judges mostly givehumane feedback; judges are not meant to be nice, they are meant to give their honest and/or professional opinions. (There’s a thing or two to be learnt from Simon Cowell)
 Little is done to follow up with thewinners and ensure that winnings are channelled towards growth and progress.
 
 
  Incubation hubs
 
 The number of incubation hubs in Uganda and the East African region is growing exponentially — great stuff! What needs to happen next is that these incubators need to set standards and KPI’s that the users of their co-working spaces need to meet.
 There are simply too many startups in the hubs’ portfolios and not nearly enough products on the market or in progressive development to match. The management teams of such spaces need to do their part in lighting fires under the developers’ bottoms to ensure that incubation hubs are only apart of the journey and not the destination.
 
  Tech entrepreneurs
 
 The other stakeholders in this industry most likely do not possess a firm understanding of the technical aspects of product development. As such, the ultimate policing force is made up of peers from within the tech-space. Tech entrepreneurs can nudge each other towards success by reviewing each other’s work from a technical perspective to keep everyone honest.
 This requires all tech entrepreneurs to stop working in the dark and bring their products out into the light amongst their peers, prepared to absorb all the feedback and opinions. These will not always be pleasant, let alone cordial but in the long run, product quality will inevitably improve.
 
  General public
 
 Perhaps the most important stakeholders, the general public should use review platforms to make all their pains known. If you go far back enough in time, every product received horrible feedback at some point in time. As users, you should always make it known when your expectations are not being met because silence guarantees that you will never get what you desire from a product.
 In conclusion
 Tech entrepreneurs and developers have chosen their path…there’s no need to baby these guys. Constructive criticism from everyone will go a long way towards ensuring that we all start to enjoy quality products from the Ugandan tech scene.
 In order to excel, you must be completely dedicated to your chosen sport. You must also be prepared to work hard and be willing to accept constructive criticism. Without one-hundred percent dedication, you won’t be able to do this.

"The rise and rise of summits and conferences focused on the African startup ecosystem
","There is a lot changing the African startup ecosystem. From funding to technology hubs. All key drivers of any startup ecosystem are changing, positively, in Africa. Yet, theres something many may not be taking note of. African startup ecosystem focused summits and conferences.

 Summit and conferences have become so common that one can rely on them to anecdotally conclude that the African Startup Ecosystem is headed for the best.
 As one would expect, the leading ecosystems on the continent are leading the way. With South Africa (based on observation) having the highest number of summits.
 Long before other ecosystems came up, the rainbow nation’s startup ecosystem was playing host to some of the biggest tech and startup summits and conferences across Africa.
 This year, so far, Johannesburg, one of the country’s startup hubs has hosted the Blockchain Africa conference. With South Africa Innovation Summit, AfricaCom and Africa Early Stage Investor Summit set to happen in the country, later this year.
 But, Nigeria and Kenya are also contributing a good deal. Lagos, Africa’s startup capital, is gearing itself for the TechFest. While, Abuja, Nigeria’s political capital, will host Nigeria Innovation Summit later this year. Andela’s Women in Tech Summit as well as Techpoint’s Build conference have already happened.
 Nairobi, one of Africa’s tech hubs, has so far played host to a couple. This includes Sankalp Summit and Nairobi Innovation Week. The city’s first Innovation Week organized by the University of Nairobi.
 Additionally, UK’s The Economist organized the Innovation Summit Africa earlier this year. The African Summit on Entrepreneurship and Innovation, ASENTI, will take place later in 2018.
 In the North of Africa, Casablanca, Morocco, hosted the AfriKonnect 2018 conference which was to “connect North and Sub-saharan tech scenes.”
 Additionally, the Annual African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, AVCA, the conference took place in Marrakesh, in April 2o18. The country will also host the Demo Africa conference for the years 2018 and 2019.
 Egypt, which is among the leading tech ecosystems in Africa, hosts the annual Rise Up Summit by Wamda. As well as the Egypt Entrepreneurship Summit.
 Looking at what others would regard as second-tier African startup ecosystems, in terms of investment and hubs, similar trends are noticed.
 Rwanda has so far hosted two of the biggest summits on the continent. That’s both in the number of attendants and their quality.
 Kigali, the nations capital, has hosted the Africa Tech Summit, in February, and Transform Africa Summit. Which took place last week (May 7, 2018).
 In June, Kigali will also host the Africa Innovation Summit. It’ll look to build onto what was discussed and agreed upon at the first and previous one in Cape Verde.
 Last year, the city also hosted the Youth Connekt Africa Summit. Alibaba’s Founder and Chairman, Jack Ma, attended and made a couple of promises.

 Uganda’s Capital, Kampala, is also promising. Last year, it once again had its premier tech summit, Swarm Summit, happen. While, The Innovation Village, a tech hub, also organized Kampala Innovation Week. The ecosystem’s first Innovation Week. Both events are set to happen again this year.
 This month, the Blockchain Association of Uganda is organizing the biggest Blockchain conference in Africa, yet.

 Ghana and Tanzania are also having exciting activities happen in their ecosystems.
 Last year, Accra, Ghana’s capital, hosted Tech in Ghana Conference. It is also set to happen again later this year, with a corresponding one in London. The Ghana Tech Summit will also take place later this year.
 Tanzania, another fledgeling ecosystem, has Sahara Sparks, an annual conference. The 2018 event will take place alongside the AfriLabs Annual General Meeting in Dar es Salaam.
 In Francophone Africa, Senegals capital, Dakar, hosted the two-week long Africa Internet Summit in April and May this year. The summit will take place in Uganda’s capital next year.
 While Ivory Coast hosted the EU-Africa Business Forum last year. Where the controversial Africa Startup Manifesto was launched by Startup Europe Africa Network.
 In other really emerging markets on the continent, Somalia and Ethiopia are promising, too.
 Both countries, found on the Horn of Africa, are still in their nascent stages but seem keen to catch up. Ethiopia is set to hold a week-long ICT Expo in June. While Somalia’s recently launched iRise hub announced that it’ll host Mogadishu Tech Summit in July this year.
 Beyond the borders of the continent, still, summits and conferences are taking place. Aimed at shaping the future of tech and startups across the continent.
 Last year, Quartz Africa held its African startup ecosystem focused  Accelerating Africa event in New York City. The event, dubbed Accelerating Africa 2.0 had speakers like Elizabeth Rossiello from BitPesa, Tunde Kehinde from Lidya as well as Eghosa Omoigui from EchoVC.
 In April this year, the Africa Fintech Summit happened in Washington DC. Seedstars World Summit, though focused on the entire emerging world, has also shone a light on the African startup ecosystem. Seedstars also hosts an annual regional Seedstars Summit Africa.
 While London will host the Annual Africa Tech Summit (this week actually), once again. As well as the Tech in Ghana Conference. The Paris-based Hub, Afrobytes, will also hold its annual Afrobytes conference later this year. It will take place in Paris.

"Jack Ma Promises to Support Young African Entrepreneurs Through 4 Projects
","Jack Ma, the Founder and Executive Chairman of Alibaba Group, spent this week in East Africa in his first visit to the continent. He expressed his belief in the potential of the continent and its young population.
 Ma, in the company of other Chinese billionaires and investors, made his first stop in Nairobi where he delivered a keynote speech. The majority of the speech surrounded the untapped opportunities in the continent as well as the future of globalization.
 After his visit to Kenya, the billionaires next stop was at the annual Youth Connekt Africa summit in Kigali. It was at the summit, also attended by Rwandas President Paul Kagame, in Kigali that Jack Ma announced four groundbreaking projects.
 For the first project, Ma invited 200 African young entrepreneurs to work at Alibaba headquarters. This will be aimed at them gaining valuable experience in fields including e-commerce, Artificial intelligence, as well as the Internet.
 
 They will come back to Africa to develop their businesses and help others grow their businesses  Ma said
 
 For the second one, he said that Alibaba will work with Universities in Africa and governments to train specific courses around the same areas.
 The third Project, which he said is a partnership between Alibaba and Paradise Foundation of China, will deal with promoting and supporting Environmental conservation efforts in Africa especially protecting elephants and other precious animals.
 
 We will give a prize to 50 Rangers for the next ten years to thank them for their tireless efforts in conservation  Ma said
 
 In the Fourth and last project, to show his confidence in Africa, Ma pledged to invest in the continents youth. He hinted on the fact that the continent has the youngest population in the entire world  with an average age of 19.
 
 I wanna show my confidence in Africa..so I start with my foundation to Africa entrepreneurship fund to support young entrepreneurs to realize their dreams  Ma
 
 He, therefore, promised to invest USD 10 Million in the fund. Adding that “I believe more people will come in to support the fund and make it bigger.”
 In his keynote speech in Kenya, he encouraged Africa to speed up. This will allow it to take advantage of the countless opportunities the continent possess. He also discouraged Africans from worrying about anything as it is the same disease slowing down
 He also discouraged Africans from worrying about anything as it is the same disease slowing down Europeans and Americans. This, he said it with the re-assurance that Africa has nothing to lose.

"UPDATE: All details about Hive Colab&#8217;s Swarm 2017, event to bring together all Uganda&#8217;s ICT and startup stakeholders
","UPDATE
 SWARM is an annual summit conceived by the Hive Colab, the first hub in Uganda, in partnership with several other ICT and startup stakeholders in Uganda. The inaugural Summit was held in December 2016 at Hive Colab, however, this years is set to take place at The Square place in Industrial  a much bigger place.
 Last year, the event gathered Ugandan startup founders and tech enthusiasts, and the main intention was to carve out Ugandas digital future. Something theyre looking to build on this year.
 The minister of ICT, Frank Tumwebaze, Martin Ssekajja from KCCA and Albert Mucunguzi from ICTAU were some of the speakers at the summit.
 This year, the event will take place on the 7th and 8th of December with sponsors including Andela, Dignited, Fenix International, MTN, and SEACOM.
 At the very event, Startup Digest Africa will be on the media panel discussing the top events that defined the Ugandan startup landscape this year, as well as what to expect next year. Additionally, Startup Digest Africa shall reveal a ranking of the top 10 startups in Uganda for the year 2017 at the same event.
 Some of the key speakers for this years event include TMS Ruge, Albert Mucunguzi, James Saaka, Hon. Frank Tumwebaze, Vivian Ndambya, Barbara Birungi and others.
 You can find additional details about the events activities here.
 Below is the original article which features details of a conversation with TMS Ruge about the event. Please note that some things may have changed since the last time we spoke to him in July this year.
 Swarm 16
 Asked about any progress from last years event, TMS Ruge admitted that there hadnt been much implemented from the previous Swarm discussions except the ICT Certification Bill which was passed quietly. He made it clear that this was passed, but he was against the idea.
 
 You dont need a mandatory certification body when the industry itself has industry certifications. There is Microsoft, Oracle and other programming certifications that one can go through. I have never heard anywhere in the world where the government says we have succeeded because our industry has programmers that are certified  TMS Ruge
 
 He felt there were, and still are, more urgent issues to be addressed. Issues like lowering the cost of internet data so that developers can spend more time online working on their craft or actually enable the clients of these developers to come and stay online.
 However, TMS Ruge concludes, that this is common of all arrangements that involve the government as a stakeholder. He says that they are usually so desperate to seem authoritative and in the end, they dont consult but end up telling people to do this and that.
 Swarm 2017
 Swarm is going to be spread out to all the hubs across the country. Each hub is going to be a co-organizer or a participant. Hive Colab did launch the initial Swarm but, according to TMS Ruge, itd be better if the entire ecosystem participated starting with this one. All the hubs have been invited to participate this years.
 
 We are not looking to own the event. We are looking to get collaboration from all stakeholders in the ecosystem  TMS Ruge
 
 TMS Ruge believes that whether youre Innovation Village, Outbox, a startup founder or any other stakeholders in the ecosystem you are facing almost the same challenges. Therefore, it is better that everyone comes together and we shape the future of the ecosystem on a united front.
 This is one of the latest efforts from TMS Ruge to see that everyone is leveraging another rather than working on their own. In order to further enforce unity as opposed to a one man show, the event is to be moved from Hive Colab (which can no longer accommodate the audience) to the much larger The Square Place in the industrial area.
 For 2017, expect a feature of a list of various startups that are so far performing well in the Ugandan startup ecosystem. This is aimed at helping those that would like to invest in these startups easily identify them as well as show the world what is happening in the country. The list of speakers and key participants is yet to be communicated.
 Competition
 However much TMS Ruge preaches a united ecosystem, he also believes that a healthy competition is necessary to keep everyone thinking and innovating. He mentions the fact that when they launched Hive Colab as the very first hub in Uganda, their intention was to have various Hive Colabs replicated across the country.
 Though, financial challenges wouldnt allow them achieve that goal. Yet with the mushrooming of various hubs and innovation centers, TMS Ruge is more than happy that what he thought they would do is actually being done by others.
 He also believes that with different players on the scene, new and diverse ideas are brought on board.
 Ministry of ICT Innovation Hub Plans
 As we concluded our conversation, we talked about why the government finally decided to build its own innovation hub instead of joining forces with the already existing hubs.
 When asked whether the government detected that there was no unity amongst the already existing stakeholders, TMS Ruge refuted the claim. He instead pointed out that Hon. Frank Tumwebaze made visits to almost all Innovation hubs around Kampala and actually saw that they visit each other.
 TMS Ruge blamed this decision by the ministry on the fact that the government doesnt consult but rather just dictates. For example, instead of the officials consulting and listening to the existing players on whether they needed to set up a parallel hub, they just asked them how they can also set up one.
 In conclusion, TMS Ruge said that however much our ecosystem is still young that almost any idea is valid, the government is making a wrong move on this one.
 The Future
 Currently, Swarm is still operating on a local scale. But thats not the end goal. The end goal is to turn Kampala into an international destination for the top Angel Investors, Venture Capitalists, Mentors, Startup founders, policy makers as well as serial entrepreneurs from across the globe.
 The date for the event is expected to be maintained. So, the expectation is that every 8th of December, one is looking up-to Kampala.
 As we concluded our argument, we both agreed that this has been long in the waiting. The organisation of the event is still under way but we shall keep you up-to-date with all the proceedings.

"7 considerations to be made when coming up with Uganda&#8217;s Youth Venture Capital Fund 3.0
","To date, Uganda has had the youth venture capital fund in different forms and guises. This is to try and kick-start youth employment by providing funding to entrepreneurial youth. The fund has taken the form of a debt fund ie loans. Disbursed through commercial banks to groups of youths. Though it is on the basis of ideas that have not gone through a typical venture cycle.
 In the same period, there have been examples of successful funds and models elsewhere. I thought I should draw on these lessons of failure and success from Uganda’s youth venture capital fund and elsewhere to present a structure for the youth venture fund 3.0.
 
 1. Debt no, equity yes: By their very nature, youth ventures are usually in the early stage. With little to no revenues and needing patient risk capital. Imposing debt with strict repayment terms and steady cash flow requirements is not suited to early-stage ventures with unstable cash-flow at best.
 
 2. Capacity building: Financing for early-stage ventures to youth with limited business experience is likely to fail unless they are supported by a capacity building, business development and mentor support. Any youth venture fund should have a capacity-building component. Which you can call an accelerator program.
 
 3. Targeted sectors, regions: Not every business idea will thrive in every locale. To drive intentional innovation and growth in targeted sectors and regions, there may be a need to focus venture funding for targeted sectors or ideas in targeted regions of the country. This will encourage and nurture region specific and appropriate ventures and drive economies of scale for market linkages, financing, agglomerated supply.
 
 4. Minimum ticket size: Think about the minimum funding size required for a venture. While youth venture funds have distributed UGX. 5million for some ventures, such amounts will not cover registration of the company or even patenting of an idea. Minimum ticket sizes have to be enough to encourage venture opportunities.

 5. Match fund and blended finance: Structuring a venture fund on the basis of government capital alone does not optimize the available funding sources. The government should tap into institutional capital. Especially catalysing local capital. A way is to use the government funding as a first lost protection or anchor investor capital. This is to crowd in private sector capital and also help nurture and build a local angel/seed investor base.
 
 For example, the government may offer its funding as a guarantee for first loss to encourage other institutional and local investors including investment clubs, retirement benefit schemes, pension schemes, angel investors to participate in startup investment.
 
 6. Tap into mentor networks: By doing #5 above, government works with and taps into the mentor network available to investors and professionals.
 
 7. Private sector fund managers: Lastly, running a fund requires competent qualified fund managers. Through supporting programmes for building the capacity of local fund managers such as Capria VC, CDC Accelerator, GIIN Fund Manager Masterclass, there is a support network to build and grow local fund managers who can manage a venture fund.
 
 The building blocks for a successful local venture fund have been outlined and are already being tried separately either through previous programmes or with existing players in the ecosystem albeit disjointedly.

"21 jargon (you&#8217;re likely to find) in a convertible debt term sheet explained
","Previously SDA shared the key startup jargon you need to know to raise funds for your startup. We continue this by including below key jargons associated with convertible debt term sheets.
 Term sheets will vary as the type of financing being sought. Implying that a term sheet for equity financing is not the same as that for debt or convertible debt. Therefore, depending on the type of funding youre seeking, the term sheet shall vary.
 Though this article will focus on the key terms youre likely to find or use in a convertible debt term sheet. In case you do not know what convertible debt is, Investopedia breaks it down for you here.
 But, basically, convertible debt is a financing instrument that has both debt and equity-like features. When one invests as convertible debt, the investment is treated as debt with interest payments periodically. But, the investor retains the right to convert to equity at a known discount to the company’s valuation as defined in a future funding round.
 It could be at IPO, Seed round, or VC round. But within a set period else the investment amount, which is debt principal, is paid back.
 Convertible debt suits early-stage businesses as it offers flexibility by providing financing now while allowing a fair valuation of a business to be determined at a later date. Hopefully, if the valuation of the business goes up then the founders are not diluted as much.
 A convertible debt termsheet will usually be negotiated, just like all financing termsheets, after the pitch deck has been shared. As well as all the questions and due diligence have been done.
 The term sheet then forms the basis for the convertible debt agreement or Convertible Debt Note that shall be signed between the Company/Issuer and the Investor.
 Now, what are the key terms to negotiate or as defined in a convertible debt term sheet:
 1. Issuer/Obligor: The Company seeking convertible debt
 2. Investor(s): Investor buying or investing as convertible debt
 3. Amount/ Instrument: Amount of financing being sought, convertible debt is unsecured convertible promissory notes (the “Notes”). In other words, the debt is secured against a promise to pay back in the future or convert into equity in the business, the Principal.
 4. Purpose: The reasons for which the convertible debt is required, usually accompanied with an investment plan/company business plan
 5. Unsecured Security Interest: Convertible debt is generally an unsecured obligation of the Company.
 6. Issue Date: Days from the signing of the term sheet that the convertible debt is provided to the Company
 7. Maturity Date: Period from the issue date by which the convertible debt must be paid back or converted into equity
 8. Coupon/ Interest: [X]% per year, with the option to capitalise on the Note’s principal. The interest that shall be applicable per year on the convertible debt. There is an option to capitalize the debt into the Principal. Typically a [Y%] per year default penalty may apply if the Coupon/Interest is not paid.
 9. Payment Dates: Dates on which the interest and/ or Principal will be paid.
 10. Interest: This may be quarterly on the amount outstanding at start of the quarter, paid in arrears.
 11. Principal: This may be paid all at maturity but the Issuer may reserve the right to prepay with no prepayment penalty
 12. Ranking: This defines the hierarchy convertible debt holders will have in event of repayment of obligations. Ordinarily, holders of the convertible debt notes shall be subordinated (paid after) to any credit or debt facility issued by a bank or other lending institution to the Company. However, equity investors are subordinated to convertible debt holders.
 13. Mandatory Conversion: It is typical for convertible debt to automatically convert to equity at the Conversion Price upon a Qualified Financing.
 “Qualified Financing” means a transaction or series of transactions for the purpose of raising capital pursuant to which the Company issues and sells shares of its stock for an aggregate gross of an agreed amount. This excludes all proceeds from the conversion or cancellation of the Notes into stock.
 14. Conversion Price upon a Qualified Financing: The Conversion Price for convertible debt when a Qualified finance occurs is usually defined as the lesser of;
 
 (i) a set percentage (the “Conversion Discount”) of the share price paid by the investor(s) in the Qualified Financing. The percentage depends on the stage of the business and
 (ii) the price per share equal to a set amount, [$], divided by the aggregate number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of immediately prior to the Qualified Financing. This is inclusive of all convertible and exercisable securities then outstanding (the “Valuation Cap”).
 
 15. Voluntary Conversion: The Notes may be converted into Ordinary shares at the option of the Investor upon announcement by the Company of a “Change of Control”.
 An example of “Change of Control” may mean:
 “Change of Control” means either:
 
 (i) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions. This may include, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation or stock transfer, but excluding any such transaction effected primarily for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company. or
 (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.
 
 The Conversion Price applicable upon a Change of Control shall be a set percentage of the share price paid in the transaction resulting in the Change of Control.
 16. Covenants: The Note will contain standard affirmative  call them dos  and negative call them dont’s   covenants for a financing of this type. Including but not limited to the following; a waiver of the Covenant shall usually require the consent of Note holders representing a majority percentage of the outstanding principal and interest on the Notes.
 Affirmative covenants will require the Issuer to:
 
 continue its corporate existence
 comply with applicable law
 pay taxes
 protect its intellectual property
 prepare financial reports in accordance with financial reporting standards on a quarterly basis and annual reports audited by an outside accountant.
 
 Negative covenants will forbid the Issuer to:
 
 change its business or enter a new line of business
 dispose of its assets other than in the ordinary course of business and not to exceed a set amount, in the aggregate
 enter into an agreement to merge or combine with another company
 make any acquisition of another company, its business or assets, except for certain purchases of inventory in the ordinary course of business
 issue dividends, stock repurchases or redemptions, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or make other restricted payments exceeding a certain amount
 Make any loans or investments exceeding a certain amount other than in the ordinary course of business
 incur any lien or make any negative pledge, other than mechanics’ liens in favour of suppliers incurred in the ordinary course of business
 incur any additional indebtedness, including guarantees, sale-leasebacks, and other contingent obligations exceeding a certain amount other than in the ordinary course of business
 increase the size of its Board of Directors beyond the number of members
 increase the annual cash compensation for an employee by more than set percentage over the previous year
 
 17. Conditions Precedent to Disbursement: These are the terms required to be fulfilled prior to the investment or money being disbursed for the convertible debt. These may be determined following due diligence on the Issuer
 18. Events of Default: These include actions that if they occur, are considered to be a breach of the convertible debt terms. These may include;
 
 Failure to pay
 Continuous breach of any other material representation or warranty, and
 Bankruptcy or insolvency.
 
 19. Confidentiality: The terms of this term sheet shall be kept confidential by the parties for one year from the date of its delivery to the investor. Neither party shall disclose, directly or indirectly, these terms to a third party without the prior written consent of the other party. Other than the employees, lenders, owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party. Provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential, except in order to comply with any applicable law, order, or regulation.
 20. Governing Law: The Law of the Country that will apply, for example, Uganda. The Law that shall govern disputes and arbitration.
 21. Transfer/Conversion Terms: Define the conditions governing transfer and or conversion of the convertible debt. The transfer and conversion may be subject to some restrictions for example:
 
 i) a minimum convertible or transferable amount say $10,000 Notes at a time
 ii) the holding of/or sale of the equity to an entity in violation of Country laws may not be permitted
 iii) transfer without the prior written consent of Company may result in a loss of the right to convert to shares.

"Early Stage Startup Investment Conference yields an angels network and a social impact fund
","In the second week of April 2019, the Early Stage Startups Investment Conference (ESSIC) came to a close in Cotonou, Benin. The conference brought together in excess of 120 participants representing the Benin government, NGOs as well as bilateral and multilateral organizations. Also in attendance were foundations, investors and startups.
 The main draw for this gathering of business minds was the search for ways to free startups from the financing shackles that hinder their development. From the various deliberations, two developments stood out from the rest.
 The first was that local entrepreneurs, investors and professionals – as well as those from the diaspora – came together to form the Benin Business Angels Network (BBAN).
 The network will invest in the startups and their events and also open up their networks to the fledgling companies.
 Secondly, the conference also saw the announcement of Noru Capital – an impact investment fund zeroing in on early-stage startups. EtriLabs lead the charge in founding this evergreen fund which will provide financing in the form of equity and quasi-equity.
 Promising Benin-based startups that have great teams will receive funding. These startups should have achieved product-market fit as well as business models poised for rapid growth in Benin and beyond.
 However, EtriLabs will only assume limited partner position in the fund. An independent and professional fund manager will be at the helm of Noru Capital.
 Two-pronged approach
 According to EtriLabs, it was necessary to launch an angel network as well as a fund because the two entities fulfill different missions.
 The BBAN is geared towards providing seed money to promising startups as well as molding emerging entrepreneurial minds in the Benin startup space. 15 of the founding members also pledged to invest at least $4300 annually.
 The network is hoping to invest in the first startups by the end of May 2019, focusing on business entities in spheres encompassing fintech, edutech, agribusiness, and renewable energy. With a minimum ticket size of $2500, BBNA will make investments as syndicates. Three startups are already on hand to receive the first investment.
 On the other hand, the impact fund will single out early-stage startups with young and female founders who are looking to solve local problems, create jobs and reduce poverty as well as risky migration.
 With plans to raise $10 million – $800,000 of which have already been secured – in an evergreen fund available to Beninese startups, the fund will readily support startups in their bid to become viable and formulate scalable business models.
 Not only will the fund inject the right amount of funds into the startups, but it will also ensure that the investees are ready for subsequent investments. This incremental disbursement approach – with tickets ranging from $25,000 to $500,000 – as well as the low management fees will stand the startups in good stead.
 Before the formation of EtriLabs, the startup space in Benin was in a nascent state. A few years on and the increased internet last mile access has seen the number of tech startups increase. EtriLabs, as an accelerator, is perfectly poised to steer these startups through the choppy waters of early entrepreneurship.
 With the introduction of the Benin Business Angels Network and Noru Capital, Beninese entrepreneurs are set to make their mark on the West African tech space – if not the entire continent.

"Wala announces launch in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Uganda
","On April 25, 2018, Tricia Martinez, the Wala CEO, announced the company’s expansion to Uganda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
 This was through Wala’s official medium account. The expansion, Martinez wrote, will enable Wala “tackle financial exclusion affecting 1.3 Billion people.”
 “ Wala, the blockchain-powered financial services platform and launch partner of Dala cryptocurrency, has announced that it is now live in three markets, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Uganda,” Martinez wrote.
 Wala, a payments, and remittances company, will now enable “the world’s first borderless, rewards-driven, zero-fee financial platform, users in these three countries can access remittance, savings, value-added services, and credit services powered by the Dala cryptocurrency via their smartphones” in the three countries.
 
 “This launch is a giant leap in the right direction to solve a problem that impacts almost half of the global population.”
 
 According to Martinez’s post, it seems the company is still harboring growth ambitions. With the possibility of expanding to more markets in the near future.
 “Wala is now live in three markets, and through an aggressive growth strategy that includes pre-installing Wala on smartphones numbering in the 10’s of millions through an engagement with Spire, will be live in an additional eight markets before year-end,” Martinez wrote.
 Wala describes itself as a “mobile financial services platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.”
 According to its CrunchBase profile, last year, the company raised two rounds of funding with the last one being an Initial Coin offering, ICO, in December that brought in US $1.2 Million.
 While the details of the Venture round that it raised from Newton Partners in October werent disclosed, prior to that, Wala had raised a seed round from two undisclosed investors in January 2016.

"RemitFund to become the world’s first African Diaspora Investment Fund
","According to the World Bank, remittances to sub-Saharan Africa grew to $37.8 billion in 2017. These are forecast to hit around $39.2 billion this year and $39.6 billion in 2019. When this money remitted, it is for different purposes. From supporting parents and relatives to personal investments.
 Against this backdrop, a group of diasporas are launching a fund. RemitFund  a non-profit  is set to capitalize on remittances by Africans in the diaspora. The fund is looking to transform remittances into social impact.
 RemitFund aims to leverage these financial flows for greater social impact on the continent, says Grace Camara. RemitFunds the Founder and Executive Director of Remitfund.
 According to her, they will do it by enabling Africans in the diaspora to donate a percentage of their remittances to an investment fund.
 Remittances to Africa play a crucial role in developing the continent. “They provide a huge safety net for many families,” Grace said. If not used for taking care of relatives, remitted funds also act as capital for starting SMEs across the continent.
 Yet, Grace thinks that they can do more. Especially providing a solution to unemployment.
 
 “Remittances in their current form will not provide enough investment to curb the brain drain of skilled Africans who struggle to find employment and so look for opportunities abroad”.
 
 As per this AfDB report, Africa’s youth population is growing and expected to double to over 830 million by 2050. It also estimates that of Africa’s nearly 420 million youth aged 15-35, one-third is unemployed. Another third is vulnerably employed, and only one in six is in wage employment.
 This implies that while 10 to 12 million youth enter the workforce each year. Yet, only 3.1 million jobs are created. Leaving a vast number of the youths unemployed.
 By setting up the RemitFund, the diasporas are looking to tackle the unemployment issue head-on. “[It] is causing many young people to risk their lives in search of economic opportunities in Europe and beyond,” Grace said. Hence the move to only consider high growth potential startups for investment.
 Although they are sector agnostic, the funds focus will be “social impact businesses. Especially those led by Africans in the diaspora and on the continent”. The fund started in June 2018 and will not make any investments until next year. RemitFunds will structure the deals in form of debt, equity or both.
 “Investees will receive initial funding from RemitFund and will have the opportunity to match fund through our online investment platform. We are currently working on developing a pipeline of potential investees who are ready to receive investments from the fund and our partners.
 In the meantime, they are running business support programmes. These include Facebook Live sessions and masterclasses for aspiring entrepreneurs.
 Beyond the fund, the same group will also be looking to launch two more products next year. This includes a crowdfunding platform. Grace says that it “will facilitate a mix of crowdfunding and crowd-investing”.
 
 “There are so many diaspora-led businesses doing amazing and innovative work on the continent with very little funding. The platform will help these businesses to scale and provide even greater social impact.”
 
 While the second will be “a fellowship scheme for African start-ups”. This will run “in partnership with innovation hubs on the continent and the worlds top professional services firms.”

"The One thing Most MTN Innovation Awards Nominees Should Work On
","Last Saturday, MTN held an expo for the nominees of its 2017 MTN Innovation Awards at the parking for Shoprite Lugogo. This allowed the public and judges an interaction with the nominees   which was wonderful.
 We made stops at a couple of booths, some of which whose products we felt very proud of while the rest left us wondering how they made it to the nominees list.
 Several reports have ranked us the most innovative country in the world, something thats heavily contested internally. Those who go along with it make the justification that we are, just that most businesses are still informal.
 They also argue that most start businesses out of necessity not with a goal to go global or continental. Which actually makes sense given the number of rolex stands, chewing gum buskets, boda-bodas and mobile money stalls that litter the streets of Kampala.
 The quality of some of the MTN Innovation awards nominees signals either the huge presence of necessity-driven entreprenuers and innovations or lack of note-worthy innovations in the country all-together. Another explanation could be that those with to-be-spoken about innovations never expressed interest.
 Read: Does MTN Organize Innovation Awards and Competitions to Steal Ideas?
 That aside, theres something worrying, even those that we felt deserved to be on the list shared in common with those we never expected. Something many have said is one of the key ingredients Ugandan innovators and entrepreneurs need to cultivate in order to be able to compete both regionally and continentally.
 A few weeks ago, I was speaking to a friend who owns a fintech startup in Uganda. He told me of a story that revealed his lack of the ingredient that since then led me to keep searching for how true that is.
 During his early days of starting up, he applied to an acceleration program and was among those selected. The program had entrepreneurs from across the continent with countries like Kenya and Nigeria on the list.
 It ran for several weeks characterized by occasional demo pitches to investors in closing days.
 But, he later realized that while as he focused on how wonderful his product functioned, counterparts from Nigeria and Kenya focused on how they were expanding to new markets, the userbase growth for their products, revenue growth et al.
 The funny bit was that the Nigerian pitched an algorithm he hadnt even integrated in his product. Yet, after the investors falling in love with the aggressivness of his expansion, he later visited the room of the Ugandan to contract him for the development of the algorithm.
 Despite the fact that the Ugandan had a superior product, he failed to make it through. Why? Because he couldnt tell his story perfectly.
 This is a similar pattern i noticed at the expo. People have very good products but havent harnessed the power of storytelling.
 Its only after listening to them for several minutes that you are able to figure out the exact problem theyre trying to solve and how. But, who  amongst investors or even the awards judges  has that much time to listen to you?
 You could hardly find someone with a product they can introduce in less than 20 words. For example, M-Pesa  according to Investopedia  is a mobile banking service that allows users to store and transfer money through their mobile phones.
 Nigerias Paystack describes itself as a payments platform that makes the online payments process seamless for both the consumers and the businesses they are trying to pay. Similarly, Ugandas SafeBoda says that it offers a safer and trustworthy motorcycle-taxi experience in Africa.
 All the above companies describe themselves or can be described, in less than 20 words. And, one of them has gone on to be a success continentally, the second one is a Y-Combinator alumni and the last one has been able to raise at least $500,000 since 2014.
 Yet, what you could find at the MTN Innovation Awards expo were people trying to tell you stories of where they started from and what they want to do. It is necessary that you tell your story in very few words  what they call an elevator pitch  depending on who is listening to you. Whoever is listening to you should be able to understand what you do in those few words.
 Although there were some that could tell their story in less than a few words, most would give a generalized statement which indicates they do not yet understand the problem and for whom theyre solving it.
 For example, one particular startup described themselves as a company that solves tech problems. Yet, on a closer listening, they own a website where they post guides to help people fix simple tech problems on their own. How about they call themselves a Do it Yourself Website for Simple tech problems?
 Another similar case was that of a startup that called itself an app that helps farmers find their animals, veterinary doctors, and other services. While as this is a quick and short description, it can be made better by specifying which category of farmers.
 Because, I doubt a subsistence farmer  who by the way is the one who may not know where these services are  can use a smartphone, let alone afford it.
 To compliment storytelling, one should be enthused about their own product or skill. No one is going to think youre arrogant just because you proudly talk about your innovation.
 Just a few weeks ago, I witnessed a developer being recommended as good at Android apps development. Something he replied to with I try. What if, he had replied with talking about some of the best products he had worked on?

"Egypt&#8217;s Trella Raises $600k+ Pre-Seed Round Led By Algebra Ventures
","Trella, the trucking marketplace that connects shippers with carriers, announced that it has raised $600k+ in a pre-seed funding round led by Algebra Ventures, with participation from strategic investors, global VCs, and notable angel investors including Esther Dyson and Jambu Palaniappan.
 Addressing an enormous pain-point in a deeply fragmented industry plagued by asset under-utilisation and a lack of transparency, consistency, and reliability, Trella’s tech platform is piquing the interests of investors and businesses. The tech platform/ marketplace empowers drivers and reduces costs for shippers by improving load utilisation and efficiency, offering transparent pricing schedules, and enabling shipment tracking in real-time.
 Trella was founded in 2018 by Omar Hagrass and Pierre Saad. Hagrass, the CEO, is no stranger to the transport-tech space in the region, having served as Regional Manager, EMEA Launch and Expansion at Uber.  Saad, CTO, was previously Software Architect &amp; Technical Lead at Vezeeta. They are joined by Muhammad El Garem (previously Business Development Manager at OLX) as Head of Operations.
 Building on the fantastic success of ride-hailing startups, we built a similar solution for the freight industry in the region to improve efficiency throughout the supply chain, says Hagrass. The interest in our solution has been overwhelming, both from businesses who want to use our technology and from truckers who are getting significantly more value and more consistent flow of business through our platform. We’re optimising truckers’ routes so they’re no longer driving empty.
 Also read: With over $38M raised last year, Egypt’s Swvl expands to Kenya
 I’m incredibly excited to invest in Trella as part of their pre-seed funding round, says Jambu Palaniappan, former Head of Uber Eats  EMEA. The premise of bringing world-class logistics technology to shippers and carriers across Egypt is a strong one, and the Trella team is extremely well equipped to achieve their ambitious goals. I look forward to supporting them along the way.
 I love companies that make complex things simpler – but not too simple, says angel investor Esther Dyson, executive founder of Wellville. Trella’s combination of Hagrass’ real-world logistics experience and Saad’s tech wizardry is perfect for the task of making the region’s trucking infrastructure more transparent and efficient.
 We’re thrilled to be leading this round, adds Karim Hussein, Algebra Ventures’ Managing Partner. They’re a superstar team with proven execution ability. The large and highly fragmented freight market in Egypt is ripe for technological disruption. We are excited to be joined by a group of capable and experienced co-investors who will help accelerate Trella’s growth in the short run and support it in subsequent financings.

"Kwik Delivery raises $230k Seed round, set to launch in Lagos this month
","According to the 2018 Logistics and Supply Chain Industry report which was released in March 2019, the value of the logistics sub-sector of the economy currently stands at N250 billion (~ US $700 million). The report was presented by the Director General of the African Centre for Supply Chain, Dr Obiora Madu who pointed out that logistics is the fastest growing industry in the world and urged the Nigerian government to assist in growing the sub-sector in Nigeria.
 The growth of the logistics industry can be pegged on the ever-burgeoning demand driven by e-commerce and convenience shopping trends which have brought about the new and greatest logistics challenge for organisations called “last-mile”. The term “last-mile” has emerged as a metaphor to describe the last leg of a products journey – from the fulfilment centre to the hands of the customer.
 Across the African continent, last mile delivery is profoundly lacking and has been cited as one of the key challenges many retailers and e-commerce players face. Emerging e-commerce juggernauts like Jumia Group have had to build out their own last mile delivery service or contract existing traditional logistics firms like Aramex or DHL. The strategy has worked in some markets and floundered in others.
 Traditional logistics and delivery firms were built on the back of a well thought out and mapped out address system. Yet, that is slowly beginning to change as more and more entrepreneurs are realising how entwined e-commerce, payments and logistics are and how long it would take to fully build out address systems across Africa.
 Africa Delivery Technologies which trades as Kwik Delivery is the latest on the continent to go after the logistics and last mile delivery problem. The startup which was founded a little over nine months ago  in July 2018  has already put a team in place and is set to start operations at the end of May 2019 in Lagos, Nigeria.
 “We are 4 co-founders (two French and two Nigerians) + a 10 persons IT team, but we are currently hiring our operations team,” wrote Romain Poirot-Lellig to Digest Africa.
 However, they have not yet put together a team of riders  who are an essential part of a delivery business. But Romain maintained that they should have that sorted by the time they go live. “We aim to have at least 100 riders two months after launch. For the moment our system runs only in closed beta.”
 “We plan to go live later this month. We developed an MVP which is strongly differentiated from the current last-mile offer in Nigeria”.
 Kwik Delivery is coming to market with an estimated $330,000 in total equity investment raised. Part of this investment was contributed by Romain himself while the remainder  which was also a part of the startups seed round came from Marlinvest as well as a group of angel investors.
 “The round was led by Jean-Pierre LUCAS’s MARLINVEST, a French investment company with significant experience in Nigeria, followed by some business angels who I have known for a long time in my previous lives as a financial advisor and tech business developer,” Romain wrote.
 The $230,000 investment closed on March 29, 2019, while the other two rounds of $50,000 each were Romain’s personal investment. He also added that they have also taken in debt which he declined to disclose the amount but pointed out that it was “not a big amount”. “Its classic debt as opposed to convertible debt,” he wrote.
 Nigeria already has existing logistics players including the more traditional ones like DHL as well as the upstarts. Among the upstarts, Kobo360, Africa Courier Express and Parcel-It are the easier ones to recognise. However, each of these has identified a particular vertical that they are tackling making it evident how complex and significant logistics is as an industry.
 Elsewhere on the continent, there’s also logistics and delivery companies that are sprouting to solve the same last mile and delivery infrastructure challenge to enable digital commerce to grow.
 In Uganda, Godel launched last year with a sole focus on last mile delivery with Jumia Uganda as one of its main clients. Pink Tie  which raised venture capital last year  has also focused on solving the fulfilment challenge as well as last mile delivery. The Uganda-based startup  founded by Japanese National Jay Cho  which operates a fleet of motorcycles and warehouses also counts Jumia Uganda among its clients. Pink Tie’s other clients in Uganda as of close of 2018 included KFC, Pizza Hut and other e-commerce players and retailers amongst its clients.
 According to Digest Africa data, there are at least 54 companies active on the continent in the transport and logistics sector, these include ridesharing and hailing companies. To grow revenues, it is conceivable that companies which are already offering ride-hailing or sharing services could enter the last mile delivery space as they already have the core infrastructure and market knowledge. These include SafeBoda, Gokada, Halan and Swvl.
 This is because the aforementioned ride-hailing or sharing solutions are more than equipped to build an online to an offline business model which has been central to the spurning out of ‘super-app’ based ventures like Grab and Go-Jek in the Asia Pacific. We have already seen it with SafeBoda testing the possibility of offering food delivery services in Kenya and it is rumoured that they will soon launch last mile delivery in Uganda.

"Here&#8217;s Iyinoluwa Aboyeji&#8217;s (former Flutterwave CEO) resignation letter
","Yesterday, Flutterwave announced that it had completed the raising of its Series A Extended round. The closed round brought the startups total amount of funding raised to date to at least $20 million.
 However, in the same press release, Flutterwave announced that one of its co-founders and CEO, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, was stepping down as CEO. The document indicated that Iyin was resigning to focus on pursuing family goals.
 In the past 4 years, Iyin has co-founded two globally recognized companies  Andela and Flutterwave. Combined, both companies have raised at least $100 million in funding.
 Following Flutterwaves official press release, Iyin has also released his resignation letter. Below is the exact transcript of it;
 DEAR COMMUNITY,
 Today will be my last day at Flutterwave. After much thought and prayer I decided to step down from my role as CEO and focus on giving back to the startup community I owe so much of my success to. 
 Just a little over 2 years ago in May of 2016, myself and my co-founders at Flutterwave started on this unlikely and amazing journey to build payments technology and infrastructure that could connect Africa to the global economy and usher in a new wave of prosperity across Africa. We knew it would be an incredibly difficult and intriguing mission but we never imagined we would have the kind of impact we did so quickly. 
 Two years later the team at Flutterwave has built one of the world fastest growing payments business of all time from Africa, processing over 700 billion naira in payments across over 50 million transactions generating revenues in the billions of naira. Beyond its scale, its human impact has been profound, from connecting thousands of riders and drivers to daily enabling thousands of families in diaspora share prosperity with their love ones at home. 
 It has been an incredible privilege to lead the team through an era of incredible growth and impact. I wouldnt trade this experience for the world. This would have been impossible without the hard work and genius of the talented team of young people who are Flutterwave, the incredible support of our investors and advisors and the good will of so many who have been our biggest champions and advocates. 
 Over the next few months as I figure out what is next, Ill be catching up on sleep, spending time with my family and supporting and advising startups in our community (more to come on that) Everyone who knows me well knows what matters most to inc is my lifelong commitment to building the future of our country and our continent. As I take some time to rest and reflect on the incredible experiences I have had building two world class African success stories at Andela and Flutterwave  I am excited about the opportunities the future of our continent holds and I remain dedicated to supporting the next generation of entrepreneurs who will go on to build the next Andelas and Flutterwaves. 
 Thank you for your love and support on this journey. 
 Yours in trust, 
 IYINOLUWA E ABOYEJI

"After 15 years in Silicon Valley, Mark Karake is back to accelerate Kenyan startups
","There’s been a growing list of diasporas and expats flocking Africa in the past decade. A sizable number of these have their eyes fixated on the burgeoning tech startup scene. Mark Karake, a Kenyan who had spent a significant part of his career in Silicon Valley, joined that list.
 In March 2018, Mark decided to return to Nairobi. The goal, he says, was to contribute to unlocking the potential of our local startup ecosystem.”
 By doing so, he joined the likes of Iyinoluwa, Tayo Oviosu, Jason Njoku, and more. These, too, returned to take part in Africa’s tech startup ecosystem.
 Though, Mark is looking at contributing in a different way. He is looking at not only investing in startups but also share his knowledge and experience.
 In April 2018, he launched a fund  Impact Africa Fund  a seed stage fund aimed at technology startups in Nairobi. He points out the “lack of supportive seed stage financing” among the key reasons for starting it.
 Yet, although he is now running a fund, he is also a firm believer that “money is not the entire issue for local startups”. Rather, the “lack of invest-ability”.
 Also read: How Michael Wilkerson turned a side hustle into Tugende
 He, thus, saw the need for an accelerator. Impact Africa Network, an accelerator, thus followed the fund. It was launched in August this year. Its role is tackling the “very low levels of startup development skills and entrepreneur support. Though, the focus, for now, is Nairobi.
 Initially, Mark had bundled everything under Impact Africa Fund. But, he says that after some time, he saw it necessary to separate the two. “After some work in the ecosystem I saw the need to decouple the technical assistance work from the fund,” he says.
 He now maintains that the fund and the accelerator are two separate entities. “Our fund is a separate vehicle from the accelerator,” he says.
 Though, it is not hard for one to see how each can leverage each other’s strengths. First, through lessons learned from either and the guaranteed deal flow for the fund.
 The key reason for keeping the two separate, according to Mark, is because the “business model does not work.”
 Thus, unlike some accelerators, Impact Africa Network is not built on the back of investing capital in the startups admitted.
 I am currently self-funding the program and will be seeking grants,” he said. “Because there is no business model that fits with the work that needs to be done to support early-stage founders.”
 Also read: The making of Brenda Katwesigye, founder and CEO of Wazi Vision
 He adds that they are taking self-funding and grant funding route because it is what makes economic sense currently.
 “There is not yet enough volume of invest-able growth startups to justify a venture model, he says. On the other hand, most startups are not liquid enough to afford to pay for the value we provide.
 We, thus, take a small equity stake as compensation for the time and support we provide to ensure long-term alignment with the startups.
 But, grant funding is under question for creating a culture of dependency, instead of sustainability.
 This is because, tech hubs, the backbone of Africa’s tech ecosystem were built off grant funding. Yet, most  if not all  across the continent have failed to identify a viable business model or achieve sustainability.
 Though Mark disagrees. He is a firm believer that some hubs, like iHub, have played a critical role in shaping their respective ecosystems. And, that’s thanks to the grants.
 “They did their job of catalyzing the ecosystem in the early days and we are seeing the benefits of that in our own ecosystem,” he pointed out. Adding that people are “measuring the wrong thing”.
 In fact, he thinks that more grant money is still needed. “We need another 5-7 years of grant funding that is focussed on a different type of intervention,” he says.
 Currently, Impact Africa Network is admitting startups on a cohort basis with each made up of only 10. The plan is to run three cohorts a year over a four months period for each cohort.
 When it comes to the selection criteria, they only consider startups with “some traction. This can be in the form of paying customers or an organic growing user base for your product.
 Also read: The facts and fictions about innovation and technology hubs in Africa
 The accelerator program mirrors certain offerings from prominent accelerators like Y Combinator. “Some of the things we do such as Startup School are like YC,” Mark says, though, “with some critical differences.”
 One of the differences includes working with startups in the field and not in class. They also provide them with “custom advice and practical feedback” on an ongoing basis.
 “This means founders dont have to take their valuable time to attend generic, extended classroom-based programs over many weeks or months.”
 Mark believes that the above is crucial. Because, some, if not most, of the people trying to help startups, are doing it in a way that makes it challenging for many entrepreneurs to take part.
 “Few ecosystem actors have had direct startup operating experience, he says. Adding that this can be a blind spot.” “It is very difficult to give useful advice in an environment you have never experienced first hand.”
 He also points out that “when people don’t have meaningful exposure with startups they often have a difficult time guiding a tech startup because they present very different situations than traditional businesses or corporations.”

"5 years of Matatu: Funding, Team Break-up and Why it is Hard to get Advertisers!
","Matatu is a card game played in Uganda. Five years ago, a team from Kola Studios decided to make it possible for people in Uganda and beyond to play the game on their smartphones and tablets.
 However, since then, a lot has taken place in the Matatu camp. From raising funding to part of the founding team leaving, we bring you everything in a conversation with Sharon Rwakatungu, Operations Manager at Kola Studios  the parent company for Matatu.
 
 What has changed between when you launched Matatu and now?
 
 Well, the company has grown a lot since then, we have developed about 7 more games since then, our user base for Matatu has grown and keeps growing consistently each month as number of smart phone users continues to grow.
 
 Have you raised any external funding? 
 
 We did get external funding from the Savanah fund. They invested $25,000 for 15% equity in our company.
 
 What has been your main model of user acquisition since inception? Is it the best?
 
 Our main model now is through social media and google ads. I don’t know if it is the best but it is working well for us so far especially Facebook. From there, we are able to interact and communicate any new developments to our users. During inception however no advertising was done, the app grew popular through word of mouth.
 
 What is your mode of client acquisition? How do you rate it in terms of your short term and long-term client acquisition Goals?
 
 We are lucky to have built a popular brand so we have a steady form of user acquisition. For example, the Matatu game sells itself and has a large audience which we can also use when growing the users of our new products. This works both short and long term where we build our brand and name and be in this place where people enjoy and trust our products to be good.
 
 Is the top team still the same since you launched?
 
 No, the top team is not the same, along the way crucial members like Terry (Karungi) and Guy Acellam left to join other ventures but they keep in touch.
 
 What are your priority monetization plans in 2017?
 
 This year our priority is on trying to monetize the Matatu game itself. We have over 200,000 active user every month and over 4 million games are played everyday. This year we shall look for a steady way to monetize  the product.
 
 What has been your biggest success thus far?
 
 The overall success of Matatu is our biggest success. The goals we are constantly reaching with our user acquisition and engagement constantly for over 5 years now has been beyond our belief.
 
 Has presence in the media played a significant role in your client acquisition?
 
 Yes it has, it allows people to even know that our product exists. Its mostly significant during inception.
 
 What challenges (out of your control) are you currently facing?
 
 Our challenge right now is advertisers not embracing apps as a medium for their product. We have a lot more users than several mediums and our results can be shown in real time but their inability to embrace the medium has been a big slump in monetization
 
 Do we expect to see Matatu 5 years from today? What should we expect then?
 
 Yes of course Matatu will still be around 5 years from today, we have survived 5 years and we will survive many more. More and more people will embrace technology and our users will keep increasing. I don’t know what you could expect, we are a proactive company that embrace change and all new things as we go ahead.
 The Kola Studios team recently moved from Kanjokya street to The Innovation Village in Ntinda, joining the likes of !nnovate, Panya, Intel World and many. We wish them the best as they embark on their next five years.

"Google&#8217;s Loon set to launch in Uganda a month after launching in Kenya
","Mid-July this year, Alphabets (Googles parent company) Loon partnered with Telkom Kenya to provide balloon-powered internet to regions of central Kenya, starting in 2019.
 A month later, the balloon-powered company is extending its services to Uganda. That is according to a press release we have received from the National Information Technology Authority of Uganda  NITA-U.
 The announcement was made at an event that took place earlier today in Kampala, Uganda. Delegates from NITA-U, US Embassy, Loon and other Ugandan government agencies were in attendance.
 
 This morning, a cross-section of stakeholders from the National Information Technology Authority, Civil Aviation Authority, Ministry of Defence &amp; Veterinary Affairs, Ministry of Security and the EAC Civil Aviation &amp; Security Oversight Agency met, wrote NITA-U.
 
 Adding that these met with Project Loon to discuss how internet access in hard to reach areas of Uganda can be enhanced. NITA-U believes that with the launch of Loon in Uganda, internet access in rural areas is set to be increased.
 Loon describes itself as a company that partners with mobile network operators globally to expand the reach of their LTE service.

 An example is their entry into Kenya. Yet, the press release from NITA-U never pointed out if they have so far engaged any telecom operator in Uganda.
 Though, chances are they are in  or will consider  talks with either Airtel or MTN. Given they are the two leading telecom companies in the country.
 According to Loon, billions of people around the world are still without internet access.
 So, it is looking to solve this problem by deploying a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space that will deliver connectivity to people in unserved and underserved communities around the world.
 Loon, now part of X (formerly Google X), started out in 2011 as an idea that only got its first wifi connection in 2013. This was in New Zealand after carrying out a couple of iterations.

 It is evident that Google  and any other internet company  is looking at connecting the hard to reach or currently underserved with the hope that its services can reach more people.
 Yet, recent policies from the government of Uganda have been a deterrent to using of Over The Top  OTT  Services.
 It would be interesting to find out what Google  an internet company  thinks about continuing with investments in a country thats making internet accessibility harder.

"Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Program sees a 75% jump in applicants
","
 The Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Program hit 151,692 applications last Friday. This was a 75% jump in applications from last years 93,000+ applicants. The number of applicants to the program has been growing since the start of the program in 2015.
 
 
  
 
 
 In 2016, the number jumped to over 45,000 applicants. These applied from 54 African countries. More than doubling the number of applications received in 2015. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Nigeria alone had over 69,000 entrepreneurs apply. Which one, of course, the highest on the list. In East Africa, Kenya led the way with over 2,800. Cameroon, South Africa and Egypt led in Central, Southern and North Africa. The figures are 1,121, 1358 and 62.
 
 
  
 
 
 Looking at the figures, you can see that theres still little interest from North Africa. This could be because ventures from the North prefer the Middle East. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The other assumption could be that there is little emphasis on Arabic applicants. Because 95.86% of the applications submitted were in English. And, guess what, none in Arabic!
 
 
 
 Too often, North Africa is combined with the Middle East and not with the rest of Africa.
 So I am proud to be part of organizations like @AfriLabs, @ABANAngels and @African_Media that are truly cross continental. #WeAreAfrica
 — Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) March 3, 2018
 The growing numbers signal the difficulty in accessing startup capital across the continent. Seeing that the program gives $5,000 seed capital. Credit could also go to the now burgeoning club of TEEP alumni. The program now boasts around 3000 alumni since its start.
 
 
 The number of women applicants has also grown. Of the selected entrepreneurs for the program, the number of women increased from 24% in 2015 to 39% in 2017. This year, women are 41.2% of the total number of applications.
 
 
  
 
 
 At 31.39%, agriculture is still the dominating industry followed by Fashion at 12.77%. ICT contributed 7.31% and came in fifth after commercial/retails and manufacturing. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Despite the 75% jump in the number of applicants, only 1000 entrepreneurs will be selected. As it has been the case with the previous years. 
 
 
  
 
 
 This will increase competition and thus the quality of entrepreneurs selected and awarded. But it is also unfair and detrimental to the growing interest. 
 
 
  
 
 
 The foundation already knows this. They have already started reaching out to several potential partners. Yet, none has resulted in lifting the cap on the number of entrepreneurs the program can take in, yet.
 
 
 
 In April last year, Parminder Vir, the CEO of Tony Elumelu Foundation published a post on her LinkedIn. She requested sponsors to come on for an Opportunity to Sponsor Additional Entrepreneurs.
 
 
  
 
 
 Perhaps they didnt see the huge jump in the number of applicants coming seeing this soon. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Speaking on the Foundations partnership with United Nations Development Program last year, Tony said;
 
 
 “Since the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme was launched, we have received over 150,000 applications, but every year we are constrained to support only 1,000. We are constantly seeking means to bring help to this much broader universe of deserving entrepreneurs. We want to give this group, that we have been unable to select, a chance too and this partnership with UNDP will help us begin to scale our impact”.
 
 
 
 This year has attracted more applicants than all the past three years combined. A sign that the efforts channelled to seeking alternative means and partners to help the program take in more applicants should be fast-tracked.

"The Daily Brief: Gebeya acquires C4A, Tulaa raises $627k and more
","The past 24 hours have been crazy. So much has happened that it has been hard for me to decide on the top five stories for today.
 Actually, there are a couple I have excluded that I think you will find interesting. Take an example of Rwanda signing a MoU with Andela as well as VC firm Sobek Capital opening its Rwandan office. Rwanda is on fire.
 Lets dig in already.
 
 Tulaa raised $627,000 in seed funding
 
 What happened: Finance and agritech startup, Tulaa, announced that it had raised a seed round of $627,00 in a round led by AHL Venture Partners. The startup is barely a year old and was spun out of Esoko.
 Why is it important: When you look at how much money is coming to Africa, much of it is impact tagged. With the exception of a few startups, no one in another field can raise such a ticket size when they are barely a year. Plus, when you look at the nature of the investor. AHL has made bets on Zoona, Twiga, and Rent to Own. They are not new to above the average early stage ticket sizes. They participated in Twigas $10 Million series A. The conclusion is that if you want certain ticket sizes, then you need to know who to pitch to.

 2. Farmcrowdy CEO breaks down startup success ingredients
 What happened: Farmcrowdy CEO and founder Onyeka Akumah had an interview with Ventureburn and he broke down the ingredients for a startups success into three; hard work, relationships and luck.
 Why is it important: Africa is at a point where a few people can now come out and claim to have an understanding of the market. This wasnt the case a few years ago. Startup founders who are going to follow those that came before will definitely have an experienced batch of mentors who have been there and done that. Plus, if someone has had an exit before, then youve got to pay attention.

 3. Zimbabwes Golix is expanding
 What happened: The crypto exchange platform is expanding to Cameroon, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Tanzania.
 Why is it important: The first half of 2018 has produced so many expansions that i have lost count. Now the norm is that whoever is raising money is doing so to expand to another market. My interpretation of this is two way; Either these startups are trying to cover as much ground as possible to raise the barrier to entry. Or, they are trying to position themselves for a potential acquisition. Though, I also think that whoever is planning to do a startup in the near future should critically analyze who has raised money or who is about to. Those are your potential exits. The same goes for the angel investors. Look for a startup that can complement the services of those that have raised a significant amount when they decide to scale their operations.

 4. Kenyas M-Pesa is losing ground on P2P transactions
 What happened: TechWeez reported that Safaricoms M-Pesa is losing ground when it comes to Peer-to-Peer transactions.
 Why is it important: It is really difficult to dissect what could be happening here. There are several ways one can interpret this. One could be that Safaricom is trying to evolve M-Pesa after identifying a more lucrative area. But what could be better than P2P? Payments? Like the partnership, they just signed with PayPal? Additionally, one could say that with a service like Mshwari, most people (Bottom of the Pyramid) who carry out P2P transactions are the very ones who are likely borrowing. Perhaps whoever fails to pay back in time decides to just use the alternative. However, it is interesting for all that are building their products around mobile to pay close attention to it.

 5. Gebeya acquires Coders4Africa
 What happened: Ethiopian software talent marketplace  Gebeya  announced its acquisition of Coders4Africa.
 Why is it important: Coders4Africas CEO, Yusuf Bashir, pointed out the lack of opportunities for the developers theyve trained as one of the reasons for the acquisition. This points to a lack of a business model or not having focused enough on it in the early stages. However, given that Amadou declined to disclose the details of the acquisition, perhaps it wasnt a cash deal. This implies that Gebeya saves cash in the short run (which it perhaps may not have) which it could have spent on training these developers. And has the opportunity to scale as fast as possible to match the likes of Andela who are now about to clock 8 markets on the continent. Thats if you consider Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria and Egypt.

","The Carlyle Group has announced its acquisition of Ugandas Abacus, a pharmaceutical company. The Carlyle Group announces that it has completed the acquisition of a majority stake in AK Life Sciences (Abacus), Carlyle wrote.
 There were no Financial terms disclosed. But, the Global Asset Manager pointed out that the deal was made by its Africa-focused fund. Equity for the transaction came from Carlyle Sub-Saharan Africa Fund (CSSAF).
 Established in 2012 with $698 million, CSSAF has offices in Johannesburg and Lagos.
 The fund has so far invested over $550 million in energy, financial services, TMT, retail, logistics and more. The countries of focus are; South Africa, Gabon, Nigeria, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania, DRC and now Uganda.

 Founded in 1995, Abacus is a distributor of pharmaceutical products in East Africa. It is also a manufacturer of parenterals (IV fluids, ear, eye, and nose drops) in Uganda.
 The company has various product offerings. These range from mission-critical parenterals to branded generics for chronic therapeutic areas such as oncology, diabetes and cardiovascular. It also has a distribution network with wholesale branches across Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, and Kenya.
 According to Ramesh Babu, co-founder, and MD, Abacus has over 800 employees across East Africa.
 In August, CiplaQCi listed on Ugandas Security Exchange at a valuation of $12.5 million as the PE funds like TLG and CapitalWorks sought an exit. While Guardian Health, a chain of pharmacies across Uganda, also took in investment to the tune of $3 million from an unnamed PE fund mid last year.
 This latest development, thus, reflects a growing interest in Ugandas pharmaceutical industry.

"What to know about the upcoming BiD Network investor trip to Uganda
","BiD Network, a provider of investment-readiness and dealmaking services, is organizing an investors trip to “meet Ugandas promising SMEs”.
 The 5-day annual investor trip will take place from November 18  23. With a network of over 200 angel investors, BiD Network brings some of its members on such trips to take a look at some of the ventures they might be interested in investing in.
 “During the trips, we offer potential investors the opportunity to visit a number of pre-selected and well-prepared businesses from our portfolio,” wrote BiD Network. Adding that it enables them to “share knowledge and possibly co-invest with other like-minded investors.”
 Currently, BiD Network is made up of both institutional and angel investors from all over the world, but predominantly the Netherlands.
 Also read: Kilimall has completely shut down its Ugandan business
 On this particular trip, between 5 to 10 investors are expected to join according to Alyanne Boon, an Investor Relations Manager with BiD Network.
 They began doing the trips in 2016 and this year will be the fourth trip following three successful trips  one in 2016 and two last year.
 Although they held two last year, Alyanne informed me that they are cutting back and will be settling with only a trip a year. Additionally, they will are planning to start an annual investor trip to Rwanda from next year.
 On such trips, the highlight is the deal-making event. At these events, they invite SMEs to pitch to potential investors and are given an opportunity to network afterward.
 Also read: Pitch perfect, a Ugandan online show focused on innovators, launches
 So far, all the trips have resulted in investments being made into some of the SMEs that pitch at those events or those they tour. “Weve always managed to get two or three investments per trip,” said Stayce Nimusiima, a Growth Officer at BiD Network, in an interview.
 Yet, last year stood out for them.
 According to Stayce, a couple of investments have been made by the angel investors since last year and most of them are attributed to last year’s trip. “10 investments have been made from last year [and] 6 out of those came [about] because of the investor trip,” she said.
 What is interesting is that the amount of the ticket sizes per investee is likely to go up this time around. “The average investment [last year] was around $130,000 [but] for this trip, we are working with ticket sizes of about 200,000,” Alyanne said.
 This implies that they will be interested in ventures whose investment need is at most $200,000. Beyond the investment amount, their focus also centers around ventures that have a social impact element.
 When it comes to sectors, Alyanne maintains that they are ‘sector agnostic’ but adds that they prefer certain sectors because of their experience in them.
 “We are sector agnostic but we do focus on some particular sectors like fintech, agriculture, renewable energy, and health care services,” she said. Adding that those are the ones they are “most experienced in that but [still] open [to others].”
 Previously, BiD Network hasn’t been very much active when it comes to technology. Something I have always considered their weakness. Though, Alyanne informed me that this time around, they got an investor who might be interested in funding technology ventures.
 “At the moment, we have an investor joining the trip who is interested in technology companies,” she said.
 If you’re would like to be among those companies, they only have 12 slots and applications close by 15 September. Check out the details here.

"This is the AI company that South African law-firm, Bowmans, recently invested in
","The fourth industrial revolution is nolonger around the corner. It is in the building. And, as anticipated, it is disrupting all industries. From Agriculture to Health, Media to Transportation, Legal practice to Education. You can name it all.
 Though theres no silver bullet, theres a way many corporate firms have identified and seem to be embracing. Thats keeping as close as possible to startups or adopting the startup culture internally.
 So far, it has worked. Seeing that the number of corporate ventures has grown enormously in the past 3 years according to CB Insights.
 These are not only being used by corporate firms to invest in startups but also as a strategy to position themselves for the potential acquisition of the same.
 That seems to be the route being taken by the South African law firm  Bowmans. The firm, which has operations in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania  with affiliations in other African countries  recently invested in an AI startup called Kira Systems.
 The deal was announced in May this year by Kira Systems on its blog without divulging much of the details.
 
 Pan-African law firm, Bowmans, has invested in Kira Systems, an artificial intelligence (AI) solution, to improve efficiencies in certain key legal processes, primarily in the mergers and acquisitions, private equity and compliance areas, wrote Kira Systems on their blog.
 
 According to their website, the Toronto-based company is looking to empower enterprises through intuitive, easy-to-use software tools for uncovering relevant information from their contracts.
 The company is basically looking at significantly reducing the time and labor spent carrying out due diligence, contract analysis, and lease abstraction. It promises to reduce that by 20–90%.
 Given that the nature of its work entails reviewing a lot of documents, its by default that most of its clients are corporate firms. Currently, they list a couple of multinational corporates among their clients. This includes Deloitte, Dimension Data, Baker Donelson, Bennet Jones and more.
 During the recently concluded fintech conference in Uganda, by Bowmans and Citi Bank, Cathy Truter, from Bowmans South Africa, spoke briefly about Kira Systems. Saying that it can review over 2000 documents in under 30 minutes. A task they said would take a lawyer over two weeks to complete.
 As of 2018, Kira Systems counts 75 employees  up from 2 in 2011 and 2012. It also says that it now has over 2000 projects per month as well as 300,000 being reviewed per month in 40+ countries.

 Many were disturbed and started questioning whether this will finally replace the lawyers. Yet, Cathy emphasized that Kira Systems would actually make lawyers more efficient. Plus, this seems to be the start. Because, according to Deloitte, over 100,000 legal roles to be automated.

"Could this be a Bigger Problem than Capital, for Young Ugandan Entrepreneurs?
","
 I am in Ibanda district, for now, 4 days, and likely to be here for the coming 2 weeks. Apart from the fact that you suffer from slow internet speed (you need to balance between affordability and speed), everything else is going fine.
 
 
  
 
 
 We are implementing a program called Project 500k and one of the opportunities I have been presented with is interacting with the youths down here. Of course not knowing how to speak Runyankore makes it a little bit difficult to put my point across as well as pick theirs. Even the Luganda I speak, just realized, is filled with English slangs  which makes it a little hard for them to pick my point sometimes.
 
 
  
 
 
 But, as we have been engaging, most of them demanded that instead of taking them through the mindset change sessions, why not just hand them capital and they go and do their own thing. 
 
 
  
 
 
 This reminded me of the one thing that I hear in all Kampala startup corridors  capital, capital, capital! Theyre also singing the same song, in just a different language  calling it Entandikwa!!
 
 
  
 
 
 Yet, my quick interaction with these young men indicated that they needed something more than just money. Actually, one of them comes from a family that got a cow from NAADS and it died (you know what I mean). 
 
 
  
 
 
 Another one told me that he grows tomatoes but he has no market for his products. When I asked all the 15 people who were in the camp session if any of them had lunch without tomatoes in their sauce, none said yes. Matter of fact, all had bought the tomatoes. None of them was growing tomatoes. So, I asked Steven if he has ever tried going to the homes of these people asking them to buy his tomatoes, he said No.
 
 
  
 
 
 We have been reduced to concluding theres no capital to do such and such, but we never ask ourselves if capital is the biggest problem were facing. 
 
 
  
 
 
 I am not suggesting that capital isnt a big problem for youths, it is. But, is it the biggest? How about mentorship? How about basic skills in resiliency, sales, planning and so much more. 
 
 
  
 
 
 When I was interviewing the CEO of GrowthAfrica  Growth Frontiers, he told me that their company doesnt admit young entrepreneurs to their accelerator programs (by young he meant University graduates or those that dont finish school and decide to launch a business  especially those in hubs).
 
 
  
 
 
 To him, these people havent received any beating in life yet. They tend to live in (i hate using this word) a bubble. Anything that is likely to make them think out of their place of comfort, they shun it. To him, he is looking for people that have at least had a job in the sector theyre starting up in. Because they have more than just passion to bring to the table. Not these cry babies.
 
 
  
 
 
 If you asked young entrepreneurs who have won grants or hackathons before (handed cash) where it all went, theyll give you some vague explanation. To make matters worse, youll find them applying for more!
 
 
  
 
 
 Secondly, if those very entrepreneurs that have no capital can afford a beer, they have no moral right to sing the no capital anthem. I am not saying they shouldnt have a life as entrepreneurs, but if they choose not to look at the little they currently have as capital, then they should forget about the much more from investors.
 
 
  
 
 
 If you cant tell someone why you are holding an iPhone X yet have failed to purchase a crucial software of $50 or service for your startup, then you have no moral right to sing the no capital anthem. All you can say is that theres lack of effort or funds to tackle your thinking.
 
 
  
 
 
 Just like we all were told that AIDS is a killer disease and it became an anthem, we have been told that lack of Capital is the reason we are not having startups that are self-sustaining. It has, in the end, become a national anthem. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Even a person who has no single plan drafted on paper, a person who hasnt even come up with an MVP will tell you capital is their issue and are looking for an investor. 
 
 
  
 
 
 Is Capital the biggest problem to startups in Uganda or the thinking of the startup founders? #Malinz

"Bitcoin has dropped by 76% since its peak price 11 months ago
","Last month, Bitcoin marked its 10th anniversary. Translating into 10 years since Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper on the cryptocurrency.
 In the paper, Satoshi envisioned a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”. According to him, the currency would “would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another. All this would be achieved without going through a financial institution”.
 Since then, the cryptocurrency has gone through one of the most volatile times. Though, on a macro scale, it has gone through a wonderful trend. Cruising from a market cap of $1 billion five years ago to now over $100 billion.
 On a macro scale, Bitcoins price has only shot up. The past 7 years have seen the price shoot up by 159%. Over the period of the past 5 years, this price increase was over 328%, 1,035% for the past 3 years and 455% over the past 2 years. Except for the past 12 months.
 Also read: Here are 8 notable ICOs by blockchain startups operating in Africa
 This time last year, Bitcoin  the world’s most popular cryptocurrency  was on its way to approach a $10,000 mark. The figure was not only a record-breaking one, at that time, it also happened fast.
 By December 15, last year, Bitcoin was on its way to hit the $20,000 mark after hitting $17,900  its highest price to-date. It took the cryptocurrency close to four years to shoot from $500 to $1,000. Yet, it took less than 12 months to move from $1,000 to $10,000.
 But, since then, the cryptocurrency has been on a downward spiral. After hitting its peak on December 15 last year, many thought it would hit the $20,000 mark. Instead, it dropped to $13,800 on December 22, 2017. By February 2018, the price had dropped almost by 50% to $6,200.
 For the majority of 2018, Bitcoin has largely been on a downward trend. Except for February, April and June. In November this year, the cryptocurrency slumped to $4,000. With a further drop to below $4,000  the first time it happened in the past 12 months. Compared to its peak of $17,000, this price drop is over 76% in a period of 11 months.
 Since October last year, the price has dropped by 56% while the drop is at 42% for the past 6 months. In the past 30 days, the drop sits at 36% and 15% for the past week. In the past week, the Cryptocurrency hit its lowest price in the past year  at $3,493 on November 25, 2018. Though it has since recovered to over $4,000.
 Despite the volatility and price drop, Bitcoin is sitting at a record number of wallets. By Q3 last year, there were 17 million Bitcoin wallets globally. Currently, Q3 2018, that number is close to 29 million.
 In the last quarter of 2017, Bitcoin’s market cap peaked at $237 billion. Though, that was slashed by almost a half by close of Q1 this year. In Q2 2018, Bitcoins market cap was at $101 billion. Though, like the number of wallets, the market cap witness a jump, to $114 billion by Q3 2018.

 In total, 537 ICOs with a total volume of more than $13.7 billion has been registered since the beginning of the year, read part of the report. Adding; In comparison, in 2017 there were a total of 552 ICOs with a volume of just over $7.0 billion.
 Though Africas contribution to the ICO cake is not significant (yet), theres been some activity. We have identified 8 blockchain startups operating in Africa that are outstanding in the amount of funding  in dollars  raised out of selling their tokens.
 Though, even the highest amount raised to date is still below the current global average. Because, according to the PwC report, the average size of an ICO doubled from $12.8 million to over $25.5 million since last year.
 1. Golix, $23M
 Golix, a Zimbabwe headquartered crypto exchange with operations spanning several African countries. Founded in 2014 by Tawanda Kembo, Verengai Mabika, and William Chui, the startup supports Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda, and Kenya.

 In their whitepaper, 1 GOLIX token  pegged against USD  was priced at $0.05612. When you multiply this with the number of tokens sold, you arrive at $23 million raised. We have also reached out to them to confirm the figure since they never communicated it.
 Before this ICO, Golix had raised Seed Funding of $30,000 in May 2015 as well as an undisclosed round of Venture capital from Taurai Chinyamakobvu  an Angel Investor  in December 2016. The company pointed out that it opted for an ICO after struggling to raise venture capital for a long time.

 Yet, before that, the startup had raised an undisclosed Seed round in January 2016 in which two unidentified investors participated. This was followed by an undisclosed venture round raised in 2017 from Newton Newtown Partners  a Cape Town-based Venture Capital firm.
 7. DreamBlock, $200k
 Formerly known as ProsperiProp, DreamBlock was a Johannesburg based fintech platform that makes it possible for people to own property. Though, currently, DreamBlock lists Vancouver as their headquarters on LinkedIn and website.
 Founded in 2015, the startup launched its ICO in September last year. Though, this didnt receive a positive performance as it failed to take off and only raised around $200,000 from the selling of over 600 000 PROPX tokens through the ICO.
 Llew Morkel, the co-founder CTO of the startup tweeted two weeks ago;
 
 Proud With a tiny amount of capital (less than $250K) our team delivered on our promise. Weve completed dev on the Dreamblock software platform, apps, and blockchain. Busy testing followed by security hardening before we go live.
 
 8. Mazzuma, $45k+
 Mazzuma is a mobile money settlement system that enables payment using distributed infrastructure and encryption. The Ghanaian startup raised at least $45,000 from their third token sale which ended recently.
 According to the response in their official Telegram channel, the startup had sold 60,477.16 MAZ at the price of $0.75 as of September 8, 2018. Though, this was 10 days before the end of the token sale, which implies that the figure could have gone higher.
 Additionally, Mazzuma had a private sale that completed in April 2018, followed by its first token sale which took place from 1st June to 30th June 2018. This was followed by a second token sale which took place from 1st July to 31st July 2018.

"Kenya&#8217;s vehicle leasing firm is planning to raise $10M through a 2019 IPO
","Kenyas Vehicle and Equipment Leasing Limited (VAELL)  a vehicle leasing firm  is planning to list on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) early next year through an IPO.
 According to Business Daily, VAELL’s Chairman Joseph Kizza said that the firm had already hired a consultant to guide the IPO. The company is targeting to raise Sh1 billion (~$9.7 million). This will give the firm greater managerial autonomy to advance its growth strategy.”
 The firm, which launched operations in 2006 mainly leases vehicles to the government and corporate bodies. It realised a turnover of Sh1.418 billion and a 20 per cent rise in profits last year.

 Vaell also owns Kenya’s equipment sharing platform, Quipbank and TingA, a tractor sharing platform. Additionally, they also have subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia.
 The NSE hasnt had activity from local companies in recent times. Therefore, Vaells will be the first time in nearly four years a local firm has listed its shares. Since NSE’s self-listing in 2014.
 Although the NSE planned to list four new firms this year, only Bank of Kigali Group has been cross-listed so far. The Rwandese lender listed last week trading at a reserve price of Sh30.
 In October this year, Bloomberg reported that betting firm SportPesa was looking to list to on the NSE. Though, the company played down the speculations.

"Leapfrog Ventures to invest $190k into Uganda&#8217;s trio; Xente, Swipe2pay &#038; Francom
","Rwanda-based Leapfrog Ventures is set to invest $190,000 into three Ugandan startups according to sources familiar with the matters. The three startups are Xente, Swipe2pay, and Francom.
 Takuma Terakuno from Leapfrog Ventures was in Uganda between the months of May and June scouting for deals. He got a couple of pitches from startups at The Innovation Village as well as others from other hubs.
 However, information reaching me indicates that he has decided to invest in those three. Xente is taking the bigger chunk with $100,000 while Francom and Swipe2pay will each take $50,000 and $40,000 respectively.
 Both Swipe2pay and Xente are fintechs and located at The Innovation Village. While Francom  located in the heart of Kampala  develops enterprise software solutions.
 When contacted, both Allan Rwakatungu and Solomon Kitumba of Xente and Swipe2pay declined to comment. Referring me to Takuma Terakubo.
 Takuma confirmed that the information was true. “I [have] invested [in] 3 company [sic] in Uganda already,” he wrote. He also confirmed that the said companies and the amounts are the ones I was told.
 Though declined to give any further details since the deals were not yet concluded. But promised to give full details once the deals close two weeks from now. September 10, 2018 to be specific.
 “But [the] deal is not done yet, so just wait [for a] few week(s) please!” he requested.

 Founded in 2014, by Allan Rwakatungu (CEO) and Francis Nkurunungi (COO), Xente was among the 39 startups that were selected to participate in Alibaba’s eFounders Fellowship. It was represented by Francis in Hangzhou.
 The startup also raised an undisclosed amount in angel investment earlier this year and counts Zachariah George, the MD of Startup Bootcamp Africa, among its backer. Xente was among the 12 startups that were awarded by Ugandas ministry of ICT in April this year. It is believed that the startup secured around $50,000 from the ministry.
 There’s no doubt that the startup will be looking to use the investment to strengthen its expansion plans after hinting on the desire to do so for a large part of 2018.
 On the other hand, Swipe2pay, founded in 2016 by Solomon Kitumba, will probably be looking to use the funds for further product development as well as continue with plans to attain product-market fit.
 The startup was among the 12 startups shortlisted for the Visa Everywhere Sub-saharan Africa Initiative earlier in July. (See also: Kenya’s Mookh emerges overall winner of the Visa Everywhere Initiative)
 These deals come on the back of Leapfrog Ventures announcing a $50,000 investment it made into BiasharaBot at the beginning of this week.
 Once concluded, the deals will bring the total number of deals done by Leapfrog Ventures to 5 in less than 6 months since its inception.
 The Rwanda-based fund launched with $4.5 million and would have so far handed out $290,000  counting the $50,000 it invested in Rwanda’s Exuus. If it continues investing an average of $50,000, then it will invest in at least 80 startups as Takuma pointed out upon inception of the fund.

"A home for African designers: Meet Uganda’s Bold in Africa
","Bold in Africa, one of the 11 ventures in GrowthAfrica’s second Ugandan cohort, is a fast rising high-end fashion retail outlet that curates and houses African designers from across the African continent.
 The aim of this venture is to create exposure for African designers as well as avail affordable and high-quality apparel and accessories to consumers.
 Bold in Africa operates within two physical stores in Kampala and Kigali, and soon planning to set up an online store to reach a wider market.
 We recently spoke to the founders of Bold in Africa and we had the chance to gather a bit of background on their venture as well as their future goals and aspirations for the business.
 Founded in June 2012 in Kampala, Bold in Africa is located at the highest traffic point in Kampala, Acacia Mall. The founders, Angel Nkwaya (Operations Director), Janet Mugume (Marketing Director) and Nunu Mugyenyi (Business Development Director), met while studying in South Africa and their common passion for fashion made them friends, now business partners.
 Angel possesses a strong retail background, while Nunu studied Political Science for her undergraduate degree before transitioning to Fashion, Merchandising and Retail. Janet studied marketing. Looking at the exceptional areas of knowledge among the founders it is evident that they indeed are a combination of a strong team.
 Also read: Meet Manuela Pacutho: The Founder of The Cradle and a 2017 Mandela Washington Fellow
  They had all moved back to Kampala after finishing university and like most fresh graduates they were trying to discover what they could venture into.
 It became clear that Kampala’s many great designers were scattered all over town and it was often hard to find them. With this realisation, the idea of putting everyone under one roof saw the conceptualisation of Bold in Africa.
 You have to constantly fall in love with your business
 The original concept was based on the simple wish to open a clothing store. The three founders resolved to selling second hand clothes, whereby they used the earnings to raise enough capital to transition to what we now know as Bold in Africa.
 Bold in Africa’s mission is to increase the support of the African fashion industry, both locally and internationally.
 The designers are therefore taken through a process of improving and building their brands to achieve international fashion standards. They also learn about changing trends and markets in fashion.
 
 A model showcasing one of the designs
 
 With Bold in Africa, designers can today earn a decent and sustainable income from their design work causing them to shift from being part time to full time designers.
 The biggest challenge is that local customers have preference for foreign brands over the locally designed ones. To overcome this challenge, the three founders have made it their mission to teach people about the versatility of African designs.
 They hold photo-shoot sessions and share images on their instagram page to show people the different ways they can wear the African designed apparel and accessories.
 Their advice to entrepreneurs is; they should always be good at what they do since it increases their chances of being successful, be passionate about their business and fall in love with it constantly, ensure that they develop a sustainable business structure and have well-established systems within the business from the onset.
 It is important for the entrepreneurs to understand that the business is bigger than the entrepreneur.
 In the next three years, they hope that their business will grow bigger by branching into Southern Africa and they also plan on setting up an online store. They hope that Bold in Africa will not only be known as a Ugandan brand house but as an international brand.

"Jumia Uganda unveils second warehouse for the first time
","Yesterday, Jumia Uganda unveiled its second and newest warehouse to the media for the first time. This was at a press conference to launch Jumias looming sixth-anniversary celebration. The celebrations will comprise two weeks of discounted products.
 In commemoration of its sixth anniversary, Jumia is holding a mega birthday sale that will see customers get up to 75% discount off on items starting Monday 16th July 2018 until 26th July 2018, the company wrote in a press release.
 Located on the 5th street industrial area  besides the Bata Store  the warehouse covers over 1000 square meters. Thats according to Ham Namakajjo, Jumia Ugandas Country Manager.
 The warehouse is almost 5x the size of their first one  located on Lumumba Avenue  at Jumias main office in Uganda. Ham said that the decision to get another facility was based on the desire to achieve efficiency in their operations.
 If you ordered a mattress right now [at mid-day], we would deliver it before the end of the day because it is before 2 pm. If you order past 2 pm, then youll get it tomorrow.
 He says thats possible because they already have the consignment from their vendors in the warehouse.
 Ham Namakajjo taking the media on the tour of the facility
 Normally, Jumia delivers within 3 to 6 days. Though, they had introduced a Jumia Express option that allows one to receive their package within 24 hours of placing the order. Our normal delivery promises sort of 3-6 days, said Ham.
 But, with the new facility, he believes both Jumia Express and the normal delivery program have received a boost.
 There are two modes of delivery we have at Jumia. Theres the regular marketplace delivery and then we have Jumia Express. Jumia Express means we are able to turn around the product within 24 hours.
 Also read: Cash-on-delivery still preferred mode of payment, Jumia Mobile Reports
 Some e-commerce players like Konga charge[d] their vendors a small fee to allow them to keep their products in their warehouse. In the process, they make their fulfillment process more efficient, earn extra revenue from the facility as well as save their vendors from paying exorbitant rental fees. Something I thought Jumia was also after.
 But, Ham says their motive is not revenue driven and are not looking to make any revenue from the facility. At least in the short run.
 Right now we are not charging for it, Ham pointed out. Adding that right now we are more focused on being efficient internally than actually raising revenue from the warehouse.
 It is more about can we get these things as fast as possible to the buyers'
 Apart from Jumia, theres another venture in Jumia Group  Jumia Party  that requires fulfillment. It currently runs  together with Jumia Fresh, under Jumia Food. Yet, unlike Jumia Food and Jumia Fresh, Jumia Party  which handles alcohol and other party flavors  maintains a fulfillment center.
 The service is currently being outsourced to Pink Tie, a logistics and partly e-commerce company based in Naguru.
 Related: Jumia starts using DHL and Aramex ahead of Mobile Week
 Pink Tie, the company that carries out deliveries for KFC, Pizza Hut, Jumia Food and also runs the Kilimall venture in Uganda, is currently in charge of the entire Jumia Party stocking its products and delivery.
 Though my guess was that after Jumia Group  through Jumia  acquiring a bigger facility, which is currently underutilized, they would look to stop outsourcing for the Jumia Party service. According to Ham, thats not the case.
 Jumia Party is a little different, he said. Adding that they have a facility [which is] a little smaller than this where they also have their goods consignment  the alcohol and the party flavors.
 
 Theirs is a much much faster thing because we have to deliver within an hour. The mode of delivery is somewhat different. So we are going to keep it the way it is. Because Jumia party is working [the way it is] right now.
 
 Though he also acknowledged that as the scale of operation for the venture increases, they might revisit their plans and make the determination on whether to expand or not.
 According to one of the staff I spoke to, the new warehouse has been in operation for at least 3 months. Though not yet fully utilized to the maximum capacity, Ham pointed out that by close of the year, they hope to occupy it to the maximum.
 Currently, Jumia maintains three facilities for their storage and logistical works. The new warehouse in the industrial area, the pickup location at The Cube in Kisementi and their old warehouse on Lumumba Avenue.
 Though, they also signed a partnership with Posta Uganda which granted them an opportunity to use Posta Uganda offices across the country as pick up locations for their customers.
 For deliveries, aside from an in-house team, they still maintain ties with DHL, Aramex, Skynet and Pink Tie.

"At 27, Flutterwave&#8217;s Iyinoluwa Aboyeji represents the new breed of African leaders
","Tech startup founders in Africa are becoming the leaders or promising leaders in their countries. Or even across the continent. And, this is not going without notice from the rest of the world. Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, of Flutterwave, is serving as an example.
 Being the youngest continent in the world, Africa’s startup founders and now current and future leaders are likely below 35 years. Yet, it is becoming clear that they are the continent’s hope. If you are to go by the increasing number of recognition they are receiving.
 There are several platforms recognizing those going beyond the ordinary. To not only change their lives, but their local communities and the continent at large.
 The World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders, the Most Influential People of African Descent, MIPAD, initiative and Forbess 30 Under 30 are some of them.
 When you observe these lists, technology startup founders are increasingly becoming present.
 This year, Uganda’s Evelyn Namara, the Founder of Agritech startup Vouch Digital, was named among the 100 Most Influential People of African Descent. Alongside Samuel Alemayehu, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Fatoumata Ba and Anushka Ratnayake.

 But, among the tech founders being awarded or recognized across the continent, Flutterwave’s Iyinoluwa Aboyeji stands out. In the past 12 months, the 27-year-old has been recognized or awarded at least five times.
 From Nigeria’s finance and business newspaper, Business Day, to Forbes, falling under their 30 Under 30 category.
 Earlier this month, the Flutterwave founder was named a Young Global Leader by World Economic Forum. Putting him among “100 of the World’s Brightest under 40 invited to shape an inclusive and sustainable future”.
 This implies he will be “joining a community and five-year programme that will challenge [him] to think beyond [his] scope of expertise and be [a] more impactful leader.”
 Additionally, he was recognized by MIPAD. As “one of the Most Influential People of African Descent, Business and Entrepreneurship category Class of 2018”. Last year, the list featured the likes of Jason Njoku, Anthony Joshua, Trevor Noah and more.
 Forbes also named him among its 2018 30 Under 30 Enterprise Category for his work at building Flutterwave. The company had “raised $15.7 million in funding” and “processing $1.2 billion in transactions so far.”
 Before that, Aboyeji was named among the “30 most promising young entrepreneurs in Africa” for the year 2015 by Forbes. At that time, he was still at Andela and aged 23 years.
 See also: SafeBoda’s Rapa Thomson Ricky named by Forbes among “30 Most Promising Young Entrepreneurs In Africa 2018”
 Business Day, a newspaper based in Lagos, named Iyinoluwa Aboyeji among the “50 Most Influential Nigerians in 2017”. Citing his work at Flutterwave, still, for the nod.
 The list had the nations president, Muhammadu Buhari, who made number one. Other prominent people included businessmen in the country, like Tony O. Elumelu. As well as well-known Afrobeat artists Wizkid and Davido.
 Additionally, New African Magazine named him among its “100 Most Influential Africans of 2017”. In the science, tech and innovation category. Again, for his work at Flutterwave. AppsTech founder, Rebecca Enonchong appeared in the same category.
 In November, last year, Flutterwave won the “best fintech startup” category at the AppsAfrica Awards.

"Uber&#8217;s middle East fierce rival, Careem, has entered Sudan
","Careem, Ubers fierce rival in the Middle East, has entered the Sudanese according to Reuters. The company has so far hired 10 employees and already signed up thousands of drivers to launch operations.
 It is also looking to grow its number of employees in the country to at least 30 as well as expand to at least one other city in the northeast African country by the end of the year.
 This move makes the company one of the few that have entered Sudan a few months after the US lifted economic sanctions on the country.
 Yet, even with that, due to a foreign currency shortage, remitting cash from Sudan can be difficult due to the country’s hard currency shortage. It is perhaps for that reason that Careem said they will re-invest the revenue earned in Sudan back into the country over the next two to three years
 Careems entry into Sudan makes it the only second big player after the countrys Tirhal Taxi. Tirhal, Arabic for Trip, saw an opportunity in Sudan since Uber wouldnt operate in there due to sanctions.
 Also read: Uber and Little are looking to launch operations in Rwanda
 Founded in 2012 by Abdulla Elyas (CPO), Magnus Olsson (MD) and Mudassir Sheikha (CEO), Careem has raised at least $571 million in funding to date. The companys latest round was undisclosed and came from Chinese ride-hailing company, DiDi Chuxing.
 Some of Careems other notable investors include Rakuten, Saudi Telecom and the struggling Abraaj.
 In February this year, they acquired RoundMenu  UAEs restaurant discovery platform  at an undisclosed fee. This was their first attempt at entering into food delivery which Forbes Middle East said they will be investing $150 million into.
 Less than a week ago, Careem announced that it had hit the 1 million driver mark. This is from across its 14 markets of operation.
 It was also rumored that Careem and Uber were in merger talks in the Middle East. But, Egyptian authorities came out a week ago and warned them against such a move.
 With Careems entry into the market, one can also assume that Uber is on its way. Given that the country had a population of around 40 million by 2016 according to World Bank

"10 companies in Africa that might go ahead with their IPOs in 2019
","Going public in an initial public offering (IPO) is a milestone for most private companies. Yet, different companies go public for different reasons. Small ones are usually looking to further their growth by using an IPO as a way to generate the capital.
 Another reason is to monetize the shareholders — including employees and investors or backers. Because a private companys valuation is usually paper money until a liquidity event.
 Though, the main reason most decide to go public is to raise money  a lot  and spread the risk of ownership among a large group of shareholders. Spreading the risk of ownership is especially important when a company grows. With the original shareholders wanting to cash in some of their profits while still retaining a percentage of the company.
 Last year, the African continent saw a couple of IPOs. Some included Cassava SmartTech (Zimbabwe), Vivo Energy (secondary listing on JSE), Bank of Kigali (cross-listing on NSE), Cipla QCL (Uganda), MTN Ghana and more. Yet, while those were got listed, others were rumoured to be on the verge and are likely to list in 2019. We bring you the list we think is most likely to.
 1. Multichoice
 In September last year, Naspers announced its plans to separately list and unbundle its Video Entertainment business as MultiChoice Group on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). They cited creating an empowered, standalone Africa-wide entertainment business as the key reason. They also pointed out unlocking value for Naspers shareholders.
 Naspers will retain its primary listing on the JSE as well as its interests in Media24. MultiChoice Group is anticipated to list on the JSE and simultaneously unbundle in the first half of 2019. Though that is still subject to the approval of the requisite regulatory authorities.
 2. MTN (Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda)
 As of 30 June 2016, MTN Group recorded 232,6 million subscribers across its operations in Africa, Europe and Asia. This made it the eleventh largest mobile network operator in the world and the largest in Africa. But, being the biggest operator seems to be coming with pressure to list from regulators. Last year, there were rumors that different subsidiaries of the telecom group would list on their domestic exchanges. Though the company denied having any pressure from the regulators.
 Yet, as MTN marked 20 years of operation in Uganda, its licence also expired. As a condition for renewal, the regulator-mandated them to list on USE. It is not clear when but it highly anticipated that they will fast-track it in 2019.

 In Rwanda, MTN was mulling a sale of shares to help raise funds for its network expansion. At the same time, it was also seeking funding from lenders. It finally raised a RWF50 billion (USD56.4 million) loan from a consortium of eight banks towards the end of 2018. Perhaps this might ease their pressure on the listing.
 MTN Nigeria was among the most troubled African corporates in 2018  up there with the likes of KPMG South Africa and Steinhoff South Africa. The company was entangled in an $8 billion illegal profit dispute with Nigerias Central bank, CBN. However, they later settled it in December for $53 million. As this was going on, the telecom giant mulled scraping their IPO. But, since the dispute is over, perhaps they might reconsider it in 2019.
 3. Dangote Cement
 Last year, Dangote Cement was considering a London share sale over the next two years. In October, Chief Financial Officer Brian Egan told investors on a conference call, after reporting first-quarter financials, that Nigeria’s biggest company, owned by the continent’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, would also seek to raise $500 million via the issue of a Eurobond. That’s on top of a 300 billion naira ($833 million) local-currency bond they had announced a month earlier.
 In April, Lagos-based Dangote Cement hired former Xstrata Plc CEO Mick Davis as a non-executive director. That was alongside Cherie Blair, a lawyer and the wife of ex-U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair. The high-profile appointments were widely seen as a prelude to a listing in London. After the cement maker before mulled a share sale in the U.K. capital in 2010.
 4. Liquid Telecom
 Last year, according to Bloomberg, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe was in talks about restructuring. The talks were related to a reorganization and it was likely that it regarded plans for an IPO by Liquid Telecom. A unit of Econet that owns about 40,000 kilometres (25,000 miles) of cross-border fibre networks in Africa.
 Yet, it is also possible that the restructuring was about Cassava SmartTech  which listed in December. Nonetheless, Liquid Chief Executive Officer Nic Rudnick said in 2017 that an IPO for the company was a possibility.
 5. Helios Towers
 In March 2018, Helios Towers ditched its plans to launch an IPO in London. The listing was expected to value the business at about $2.8 billion. Helios said it had received “considerable interest” from institutional investors who were supportive of its business plan and growth prospects but its shareholders had decided to withdraw the planned listing.

 6. Eaton Towers
 Eaton Towers was the second African operator of mobile-phone towers to halt planning for a share sale in 2018 after Helios Towers. The African telecommunications company, partly owned by Ethos Private Equity, was seeking a valuation of about $2 billion in a sale in London and Johannesburg. The firm was planning to announce its IPO in June 2018 but instead decided to wait until this year.
 7. Airtel Africa
 Bharti Airtel, India’s second-biggest wireless carrier, delayed a planned IPO of its Africa unit due to the turmoil in emerging-market stocks. According to Bloomberg, the company, which was originally aiming to list the unit in London by March 2018, pushed back the share sale by about half a year.

 But, in November 2018, Bharti Airtel appointed eight banks for the intended IPO on an international stock exchange. They appointed JP Morgan, Citigroup Inc, BofA Merrill Lynch, Absa Group Limited, Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs International and Standard Bank Group Ltd.
 8. SportPesa
 In October last year, Bloomberg reported that the company, which operates in Kenya and the UK, planned an IPO in the first quarter of this year. But, CEO, Ronald Karauri, told Reuters that the Kenyan online sports betting firm does not plan to go public. Though, a source in the market told Reuters there had been conversations between SportPesa and Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital on a potential transaction.
 9. Oragroup SA
 Togolese lender Oragroup SA has plans to raise 56.9 billion CFA francs ($100 million). This will be the biggest IPO for West Africa’s regional exchange. Oragroup will list 20% of its equity on the Bourse Regionale Des Valeurs Mobilieres in Ivory Coast’s capital, Abidjan, as it wants to raise funds to grow operations across 12 countries.
 The group said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg in October 2018. The bank will issue 6.1 million new shares and sell 7.8 million existing shares at 4,100 francs per share.
 10. Jumia Group
 In September last year, Reuters reported that German startup investor Rocket Internet was preparing its African online shopping platform Jumia for a possible NYSE IPO in the first quarter of 2019. It added that the listing would potentially value the firm at about $1 billion.
 Citi Bank, Morgan Stanley and Berenberg were believed to be coordinating the IPO. Though, it wasnt the first time Rocket Internet was reported to be interested in pursuing an IPO for Jumia.
 In March 2018, an IPO for late 2018 or early 2019 in either Frankfurt or London was also reported. Berenberg, which has a track record of working with Rocket Internet, was also among the banks linked with the possible listing.
